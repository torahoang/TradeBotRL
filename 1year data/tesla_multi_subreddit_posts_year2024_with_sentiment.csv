"Some thought from first year stock investmentThis month marks roughly the first year of my serious financial investment. The returning is satisfying.

I’d like to share some thought.

**My label**

1.Long-term investing on the product of market

**Important material I’ve read**

1.Youtube: How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio

2.The Little Book of Common Sense Investing

3.Psycology of money

**Thought**

Part of my money is on sp500 related. Besides this, I still did some stock picking, which is I really want to share.

1.Nvdia:Never sold out, keep buying

Three reasons: 

a.I deeply believe productivity gain is the most powerful drive for economy growth(read it from How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio). 

b.GenAI dramatically improves productivity.

c.Nvidia is the cornerstone of the GenAI

2.PAN:Hold 

I bought some last Dec. In March, the CEO announced the strategy change of the company, the stock dropped by 30%。This does not affect me at all since I am in this industry and their strategy is not bad.

Now the price came back even higher.

3.Tesla: Bought below 200 and then sold out after “We robot” event. I was disappointed on the bland event

We all know what is going on now. LOL

4.Crowdstrike:

Sold out after outage.

**I really don’t understand it.. How come the stock price of company with this huge mistake still came back. The customers still believe in the reliability of the company product? or other competitors are so behind?**

This black swan event can dramatically affect my cognization.

5.Palantir

Seriously considered and decided not buy. Now it is 6x.

6.Micron, Dell, qualcomm

Mediumlconsidered and decided not buying it.

Since I watch news everyday, I noticed some good quarterly report and  stock gain. so want to jump in.

I don’t feel strong confidence, the drive is from its recent performance and their AI-related product, but I still feel doubt of them and don’t have strong internal acknowledge of the products.

This year really get me deeper understanding of my own mindset and the market

Big lessons:

When you don’t have rational confidence of a company, you are much emotionally affected by single event and the market. 

Business acumen: should’ve seriously considered Tesla before election.

"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise valueHello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

https://preview.redd.it/6povwnwzcn1e1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ebbefc794996c48be08cbb0144c0ee9d675cd

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

"Hear me out, hear me out (TSLA)So Elmo was on a call today with The Donald and Zelensky. 🥭 may have been negative in the past about EVs, but Elon has to have a deal in place - most likely to tariff international EVs so that Tesla wins bigly. But, we all know this. Tesla smashed it this week. Am I pissed I missed it? Yes. Am I looking inwards for losing 30% this week, when the market rallied and a young degen chimpanzee could’ve made money? Absolutely. Do I think on Monday I will be buying the Tesla top? Absolutely not. 

I think there is another catalyst for Tesla. Fuck the election, fuck the new administration. That’s yesterday’s news. I’m talking Russia. 

We’ve seen Elon and Putin in headlines recently. Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to China. But unlike Sleepy Joe, Trump, a fan of Elon, and seemingly friend of Putin, will not give a shit about this communication. With the prospect of at least a ceasefire, if not all out end, to the war in Ukraine looking likely, I believe this opens up trade with Russia again. But this is where it gets interesting. We have an inside man. Elon is first in the running to reopen business in Russia. He is the business face of this administration, and I believe his targets will be set on the Russian automobile market potential. 

Some stats I have found:
- The Electric Vehicles market in Russia is projected to reach a revenue of US$2,470.0m in 2024.
- The market is expected to experience an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2029) of 18.09%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$5,673.0m by 2029.
- By 2029, it is estimated that unit sales of Electric Vehicles market in Russia will reach 61.94k vehicles.
- In 2024, the volume weighted average price of Electric Vehicles market in Russia is expected to be US$89.9k (Elmo can sell for cheaper)

Feel free to collectively shit all over me in the comments, but can you really say to yourself this is farfetched? I don’t think so. Elon will do Elon things. This is a PR and economic win for him - be one of the faces associated with ending a war, and be one of the leaders in re-intergating Russia into the global economy.

"Lucid vroom vroomCriticism of Lucid Motors as a company and investment can stem from several factors:

1. **Production Challenges**: Lucid has faced significant delays in ramping up production of its electric vehicles (EVs), which raises concerns about its ability to meet demand and achieve profitability.

2. **High Valuation**: The stock has often been seen as overvalued compared to its revenue and production numbers, leading some investors to view it as a speculative investment rather than a sound long-term pick.

3. **Competition**: The EV market is rapidly growing, with established automakers and new entrants competing fiercely. Lucid faces stiff competition from companies like Tesla, Rivian, and traditional automakers that are expanding their EV offerings.

4. **Financial Stability**: Concerns about cash flow and the company's ability to finance its operations and growth plans can deter investors. If the company struggles to sell vehicles or generate revenue, that could negatively impact its stock performance.

5. **Market Sentiment**: Stock performance can be influenced by broader market trends. If investor sentiment towards EVs or growth stocks shifts, Lucid's stock could be adversely affected.

6. **Management Decisions**: Any perceived mismanagement or lack of strategic vision can lead to a loss of investor confidence. 

Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

"TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worthElon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.

On Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.

Much of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.

He predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from “fully unsupervised” Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his “best guess” for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.

In an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, “I predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.”

Musk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).

Tesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.

The second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.

These things are true:


1) Cybertruck is not a failure. Demand is still high.


2) FSD continues to improve and is postured better to scale than any of its competitors including wAyMo. FSD is transformational, a lot of you boneheads just refuse to admit it. FSD will be successful. But “muh LiDaR”. Shut up. You know nothing about sensors, inference, AI, etc.


3) Tesla will be the king of EVs for the foreseeable future. No competitor is even close.


4) Tesla continues to print money and hoard money. All this talk about “TSLA doesn’t trade on fundamentals only musk failed promises” is equally regarded. They’ve been successful at reinvesting in areas where they either created demand or already have demand. TSLA is a successful fucking company, deal with it, idiots.


5) “But musk is a liar who manipulates the stock”. Shut up. TSLA isn’t a conspiracy. This often referenced “cult” doesn’t have enough money combined to move the stock $1.


6) Robotaxi will turn out to be a success.


7) Optimus is also postured to scale for practical use better than any of its competitors. It will also be a success.

"$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.

"Tesla dominates! What other EV brand is better?What's yall thoughts about Tesla earnings tomorrow? Regardless what happens, Tesla dominates EV market in all markets. It's unstoppable

EV car - Model Y, 3, Cybertruck dominates all EV car sales. Cybertruck was 3rd with the 100K+ price tag. Cybertruck just lowered and eventually will release the RWD, do you know how much pent up jizz demand there will be?

Biggest EV car market in China, people there have options but there are so many random ass Chinese EV models doesn't compare to Tesla imo. Eventually Tesla tech value will outshine all those other EV brands when regulators approves FSD in china. 

Just with the tech it's head and shoulder above anything i.e. Rivian was cool but boring now compared to FSD, autonomy, etc.

With used EV car prices declining from YoY, that's a good thing cuz more people will buy EVs which will use the Tesla charging networks, additional revenue for Tesla.

"🚀 ACHR: The Future of Urban Air Mobility & Why It’s Leading the Charge 🚀**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is developing electric flying taxis (eVTOLs) with solid partnerships, including the U.S. Air Force, and aiming for a slice of a $1.5 trillion market by 2040. Here’s why I’m excited about their tech and the company’s future.

**1. Game-Changing Tech & Some Pretty Sweet Deals**  
Alright, imagine this: you’re sick of sitting in traffic, and instead, you hop into a quiet, eco-friendly flying taxi. That’s what Archer is building, and it’s not just a pipe dream—they’ve got **$142 million in contracts** from the U.S. Air Force. Yeah, the **Air Force** wants their tech. Plus, they’re expanding to places like the UAE and India. Big markets, big moves.

**U.S. Air Force & ACHR. Yeah, it’s serious.**

*Processing img qp6pziu3livd1...*

**2. eVTOLs: A Market Ready to Take Off 🚁💸**

* This isn’t just a small niche. We’re talking **$1.5 trillion** by 2040. That’s the kind of market size that gets me excited. ACHR is already in the lead, planning to have their flying taxis ready by 2025.
* And let’s be real—cities are desperate for greener, faster transport solutions. Archer could be the Tesla of the skies.

**3. Market Skepticism Presents Opportunities**

* Some investors might be underestimating ACHR’s potential. Short interest is high, which could indicate that there’s skepticism. But strong partnerships, like the one with the U.S. Air Force, are clear votes of confidence in the technology.
* This is a chance to get in early, while the market is still waking up to ACHR’s potential. 🚀

**Check This Out: ACHR vs. Early Tesla**

*Processing img q9fok5c7livd1...*

**4. How ACHR Stacks Up Against Competitors**  
ACHR isn’t just sitting around—compared to other eVTOL companies, they’re in a solid spot. More contracts, big market potential, and a growing presence.

*Processing img pvzfzv2blivd1...*

**5. Why Now is a Great Time to Watch ACHR**

* **Strategic Growth:** ACHR is actively securing partnerships and expanding its market reach. With contracts like the one with the U.S. Air Force, they’re proving their tech isn’t just a concept—it’s real, and it’s happening.
* **Upcoming Developments:** Keep an eye on earnings reports, potential new contracts, and advancements in eVTOL testing. Each of these could be a major catalyst that puts ACHR in the spotlight.
* **Positioning Early:** The eVTOL market is projected to grow massively, and ACHR is positioning itself to lead. Getting in early with innovative companies like this has historically been a winning strategy.

  
**Think of it like this: you’re getting a ticket to the future of transportation, with a company that’s already making serious moves.** 🚁

Everyone piles in because Bitcoin is now going to the moon! /s

Anyway.

Earlier this year $TSLA was going to rock everyone’s world with the highly anticipated Robotaxi reveal. We see how that went. The event seemed rushed and many important details that investors and Tesla enthusiasts wanted were kept quiet.

Well guess what. The future is still very bright for FSD, ADAS, whatever the fuck you wanna call it. Cars that drive themself.

So,

Mobileye is down 70% this year. Why? Because they’re headquarters are in Israel for starters. Secondly, they reduced forward guidance on their last quarterly earnings due to the shit show going on in China.

What has happened since then?

Iran and Israel are still in their little weiner match.

China has been throwing out money left and right via stimulus.

31% of Mobileye’s revenue comes from China. Dont you think they should see some relief from the stimulus as Baba, JD, NIO, and every other Chinese stock did?

Why hasn’t Intel sold any shares even though the were in trouble earlier this year?

Why did the CEO spend $10,000,000 on shares in August?

Why the fuck is short interest at 17% on a company with an actual product producing actual profit?

"$OKLOYOLO OKLO 🚀 - Why This Stock is Ready to Melt Faces ☢️🌋

Hey all you smooth-brained degenerates, today I'm going deep on a play I think is WAY undervalued and primed to skyrocket: OKLO Inc. ($OKLO). While everyone’s busy chasing the next meme stock, nuclear power is creeping up as the dark horse to solve our global energy crisis. And Oklo’s got what it takes to win big in this game.

Why am I so hyped? Because this is the type of stock where if you’re patient, you could see some major gains as the world shifts toward cleaner, reliable energy. But don’t just take my word for it—let's break down the reasons why Oklo's got serious potential to crush it in the near future. 👇

1. SMRs Are the Future, and Oklo is Positioned to DOMINATE 🔥
Everyone’s talking about solar and wind, but you can’t scale them fast enough to solve the global power demand, especially in industrialized nations. Nuclear is the only reliable, scalable, carbon-free solution, and small modular reactors (SMRs) are the new frontier. SMRs are safer, faster to deploy, and cheaper to build than traditional large nuclear plants. Oklo is one of the few companies with a fully developed SMR technology that’s actually on the path to commercialization.

Here’s the kicker: Oklo isn’t just developing any run-of-the-mill reactor; they’ve got a next-gen fast reactor that reuses spent nuclear fuel. That’s right—Oklo’s reactors can use waste from other nuclear plants as fuel, which is a HUGE game-changer. They’re turning a major industry problem into an opportunity, which puts them ahead of other nuclear startups.

2. Regulatory Momentum is On Their Side 📈
Oklo is one of the first companies to receive key licensing approvals from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). They already submitted their first license application back in 2020, and while regulatory hurdles in nuclear are notorious, Oklo’s head start is critical. The NRC approval process is slow as hell, but Oklo has been grinding it out for years, positioning them to be among the first to bring their product to market once the green light comes. This is first-mover advantage in a sector with MASSIVE growth potential. 💥

And in case you haven’t been paying attention, governments around the world are finally warming up to nuclear again as they realize you can’t meet climate goals with renewables alone. Expect to see a TON of government incentives and contracts flowing into this space in the coming years, and Oklo’s already at the table. 🔑

3. Strategic Partnerships & Funding 💰
A startup can have the best tech in the world, but if they can’t fund it, they’re going nowhere. Oklo is already locking down some serious partnerships and investments. They’ve recently secured funding from Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator. Altman’s investment in Oklo isn’t just pocket change; it’s a signal that serious smart money sees the potential here.

Plus, Oklo has partnered with Idaho National Laboratory to utilize their test facilities and advance their reactor designs. They’ve also struck deals with the U.S. Department of Energy to build their first plants on federal land—which is basically like having Uncle Sam as a partner.

4. The TAM is Staggering 🚀
Global demand for small modular reactors is projected to explode over the next decade. The market size for SMRs could grow to $100 billion by 2030, and Oklo is in prime position to capture a significant chunk of that. Why? Because they’re not just a concept company anymore—they have actual tech and are ahead of most of their competition. As countries look for energy solutions that are green, reliable, and scalable, Oklo is sitting in a sweet spot to capture both government and private sector demand.

5. Insane Upside Potential - This Stock Could Be a Rocket 🚀
We’re still early in Oklo’s journey. The stock is flying under the radar because people are either too scared of nuclear or don’t realize how game-changing SMRs can be. As more people get clued in to the nuclear renaissance and Oklo moves closer to deploying its reactors, the upside potential is MASSIVE.

Remember when Tesla was trading at a couple hundred bucks and everyone laughed at it? Nuclear is at the same tipping point. As Oklo continues to develop its reactors and builds partnerships, I expect this stock to go sky-high. I’m thinking $OKLO could be a 10x from here in the long term as they move from concept to deployment.

The Risks (Because I’m not a total ape) 🧠
Regulatory Delays: NRC approvals are slow. Any major roadblocks could push out timelines.
Funding Needs: Oklo will need more capital to scale production, which could lead to dilution if not managed right.
Public Perception of Nuclear: Even though the tech is safe, people are still scared of the word “nuclear.”
TL;DR
Oklo is the dark horse in the clean energy race. They’ve got cutting-edge tech, are ahead of the pack in regulatory approval, and are ready to capture a slice of the $100 billion SMR market. With strategic partnerships, a strong funding base, and growing global demand for sustainable energy, $OKLO is sitting in prime position for a big move.

"IonQ will experience a massive rally and has multiple catalysts on the horizon.**TLDR**; I’m done doing my due dilligence on IonQ and hold LEAPS that I bought a few months ago during the lows. The price has gone up by 40% since then, and I think this is only the beginning. I expect to see an ASTS-like move within a few weeks to six months for this stock. There are multiple catalysts, primarily technological, as the company produces quantum computing hardware. The technology faces skepticism. I'm not even discussing the SI as I don't care; I’m focused on the fundamental thesis of IonQ being able to commercialize this technology the fastest, and with superior tech. IonQ has doubled their revenues every year since inception in '21. Went public via SPAC, and is being discounted by Wall Street.

**TL;DR of TL;DR:** $IONQ ATM LEAPS. The company will hold an earnings call next month. Sales are increasing, and they will share their first quantum application. The CEO is good at hyping things in the media and appears to be a great salesman who knows a thing or two about software.

**Why I Think IonQ is Worth a Gamble**

The last time I posted was on September 29th, when IonQ's price was at $8. Since then, the price has increased by 30% to $10.50 today. Some might say, “Why didn’t you share this before it went up?” Well, I’ll be hearing that every month from now on.

To clarify, my previous post wasn’t sponsored by IonQ, although I wish it had been. I’ve done my due diligence and am just waiting for the share price to appreciate as we head into 2025.

Quick points on competitive edge: The company has a substantial number of patents stacked up. If you Google a picture of their office, you’ll see a wall full of patents. There’s significant revenue potential by building a strong base now. IonQ is currently commercializing its technology and claims to have built out a factory that produces these computers in an assembly line manner.

There are multiple short-term use cases for quantum computing. Contrary to popular belief that quantum will only be ""better"" than conventional computing in 20 years, we already see practical applications today. For example, quantum technology is already impacting cryptography.

**Cryptography:** Organizations like the NSA, NIST, and the EU are urging others to transition to post-quantum encryption. Quantum computers can compromise data security across tablets, phones, servers, protocols, and more. The estimated cost of data protection is about 5% of the total value, and the total amount of data doubles every year. While quantum can exploit these vulnerabilities, it can also secure them.

Another critical point is **energy savings** for AI and computing. Forbes recently published an article on how quantum technology could address the energy demand issue for AI, which I found insightful.

My research was primarily from watching company presentations at the Quantum World Congress, earnings calls, and various interviews. Peter Chapman, the CEO of IonQ, previously led the creation of Amazon's 2-day shipping and has been actively discussing quantum machine learning and its applications. He’s been kind off hyping it up, which is great for the stock. Despite what some skeptics say, this is not all hype, quantum technology is real and is being commercialized now.

I’d love to dive into more detailed arguments, but that would be a long and potentially boring read. Instead, I recommend checking posts about $IONQ on X from about six months ago, when most of the research began circulating online.

From a technical perspective, I can say that the TTM indicator looks bullish on the 6-day and 8-day charts, showing red dots that signal incoming momentum. The stock had been in a downtrend for a year but has now climbed back to its IPO price.

I’m sharing this because I’m done accumulating. My current positions are January 2026 $10 and $15 LEAPS, both bought below 40 deltas and now at 70 for the $10 options and 45 for the $15. I don’t see the point in risking short-term options, as it would likely lead to wealth destruction. Shares seem like a safer bet for those looking to invest.

Quantum stocks have faced ridicule, being labeled as scams by academics and former insiders who now make a living from YouTube videos and blogs. But to me, this skepticism is reminiscent of people in the 90s saying the internet wouldn’t take off. From all the quantum stocks I only long IonQ, and avoid the rest.

**Short-term (< 6 months) catalysts:**

* **November 11th Earnings Call:** Expected announcement of the first quantum application running on IonQ's new hardware, which the CEO claims could generate billions in revenue on its own. Still to be proven.
* **Launch of Forte Enterprise:** A data center-ready quantum computer that doesn’t require ultra-low temperatures. This means it can be placed alongside regular servers without needing a giant freezer for cooling.
* **December 5th, Quantum Basel:** Their European partner will be launching its most powerful system in Switzerland.
* **2025 – The Year of Quantum:** The UN, along with smaller partners, will promote quantum computing through media initiatives, highlighting its alignment with sustainable and humanitarian goals. I expect the media narrative to shift from AI to quantum computing, as news outlets look for fresh topics.
* **Prototype Quantum AI Chip:** This development aims to reduce energy consumption, making it more efficient. I remember ARM’s stock surge when they announced plans for their AI chips, driven by similar excitement.

That’s it for now. I’m planning to hold onto my LEAPS until they reach a delta of 1, then switch to shares and ride this investment into 2030, when workloads are expected to shift to NVIDIA GPUs and quantum computing to tackle problems beyond the capabilities of conventional systems, and companies like Oracle, Google, and Tesla are showing interest in this technology.

I know I may sound a bit crazy, but in a few months, I believe I’ll see large returns. It’s all part of being early, and I enjoy sharing the information I’ve gathered over the past few months.

"Robotaxis coming, Robotaxis coming, oh yes Robotaxis still coming!I’m sure, just like me you all have heard the famous song over past few years, “Robotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming…”,  song writer and the singer - Elon Musk!

Musk has been playing this song “Robotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming…”  for nearly a decade promising 'next year, next year'. And, each time, media, dumb analysts and his fans gather to his next concert just as charmed as previous time, only to be disappointed again!

In April, when $TSLA was around $150-$160, Musk announced the Aug. 8 unveiling day of its robotaxi, Again, the hype starts building, analysts start coming up with crazy numbers and stock starts going up, then around last week of July when TSLA rose to around $260, and knowing that there is no robotaxi, Musk panicked and again changed the date to Oct 10. Stock tanks down to about $190 in August and then as Oct 10 approaches, same hype machine starts working, propelling stock to $260 by Oct 1. Finally, Oct 10 came and Elon finally sang the song again “Robotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming in 2026, Robotaxis are coming certainly before 2027”. And, he showed a 2-seater toy car as future robotaxi! Only, 2% cars sold in US are 2-seaters!! Finally, some analysts are calling the bluff, with Adam Jonas writing “That’s it”? 

I wonder why people have been believing this BS for years and spiking TSLA stock each time, when all experts have said that all TSLA has is level 2 driver assistance system, but not FSD as Tesla blatantly continue to lie. You need a combination of LIDAR, Cameras and radars to have level 4 or level 5, fully self driving system while Tesla uses only cameras.

Waymo already operates more than 100,000 paid trips per week through its 700+ driverless robotaxis in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix etc!

"Investing and Trading has Evolved. Tell Historians to Suck ItLet's keep this brief potato heads. Go watch some NHL video from 1980. Now watch some NHL video from today. Those idiots in 1980 would absolutely suck today. They'd be too slow and too dumb to play anywhere near the top league today. Same with other sports. 

That's human nature. Through time we improve incrementally. We use the knowledge of prior generations as a base and add to it. So it's no surprise that an NBA player from 1980 would look like Krusty the Clown on a modern NBA team.

Well guess what, same shit has happened in investing & trading. And on an even bigger scale. The stakes are much higher. Instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues, we're talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money. The amount of resources devoted to ""solving"" markets is astronomical.

So now we have a different landscape from your dad's stupid tech company in 1998. Yeah, they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit & tie. Investors were onto something back in the 90's tech bubble though. They realized the trick to investing...

FRONT RUN EVERYTHING

Yeah bitch. Front run fucking everything. Radio on the internet? Fuck it, here's a billion dollars. Pets.com? Sure, you get $500M. Yeah, they took it a little too far in the 90's. But guess what, they were right. The internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich.

The reality was that, you could be wrong on 20 picks so long as you had the 1 Amazon / Microsoft / Apple. Plus, since people weren't front running as much back then, you didn't need to drop 100X Price-Sales on most of these picks (pre-1999). So who the fuck cares if you bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com), your dad's shitty tech startup? So long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts, all mistakes were easily forgiven.

So yeah, today we are thinking ""DAMN, Everything is so Expensive!"" ""AI is a Bubble!"" But guess what, that's just Boomer talk. From now on, everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit. You can forget about getting in at the bottom floor. Once an industry even hints that it will make a splash, some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it. The days where your dumb ass is gonna find Tesla at $10 or NVDA at $50 are long gone buddy.

"Robotaxis will not be a trillion dollar businessI fail to see the trillions business that Musk and all the analysts parroting for robotaxis.  It’s a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here’s my argument:

1. Every single Tesla owner I know won’t lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.
2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it’s will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.
3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.

For example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald’s or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that’s assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?

Edit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.

Edit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's ""Believe me, it will happen"".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.

"Blew my account with options. But I never gave up. Still 100% options. I hope to share my “come back” story to those who lost hope. It’s still a work in progress but trading has been fun. It tests us to the limit and builds character. 

I entered the stock market in Jan 2021. The first stock I bought was CCIV (now lucid) with options and it was the tail end of the spac-mania. Put in about 20k and life was good. I didn’t know making money was so easy. Waking up and find thousands of dollars in my account. In 1 month, I 4x the money. Surely I can do it again? 

Fast forward, I lost it all. All 80k. No risk management, nothing. 

Took a 6 months break. But I came back, 100% on options. 

This is not addiction. This is dedication. 

Honestly, I can’t remember what I bought when I returned. I only remember buying Chinese options when HSI (hong Kong index) went back to 1997 level. Gained lots but lost more and I swore to never touch Chinese stock again. But they become relevant again because of the stimulus. (More on that later)

My low point was 7k at the start of 2024 and I managed to 5x it with the AI boom. I’m fucking sure no one expected the market to recover late last year. AI carried the entire stock market. 

I’m lucky I was out before the implosion happened on late July - August. I was still down 20% but remember, it’s 100% options. It could be much worse. 

Right now I’m 60% in US stocks (30% in Tesla for the robo taxi) and 40% in Chinese stocks. 

What I’ve learnt so far:
-slow money is faster. Fast money is death. 
-price to dream ratio is the best when things are hyped and uncertain. (Hence Tesla and Chinese stock)
- don’t earn the last dollar. Run when everyone is onboard. (Totally out of AI) 
-never concentrate more than 30% in 1 holding. 
-when you are not certain, Buy/Sell half of the intended position. 
- you only buy more/leverage more if you are in the green. Never the other way around. 


Looking ahead, I positioned more Chinese options. I think this is the moment I’ve been waiting for. I can read Chinese and I find that English DD doesn’t go into the details of the stimulus. Particularly, 800b yuan swap facilities for collaterals (including stocks which makes even less supply) can ONLY be used to buy stocks. This is their equivalent of QE and their timing is impeccable. (They were waiting for fed to cut rates.) they probably also need the stock market to replace their currently dead real estate market. 

3 Reasons to buy
1. Stocks can be used as collateral and be locked up (supply drops) and the money must go into the stock market. (Demand increase)
2. It’s mentioned that there could be more rounds of the same size. 
3. They are cheap. Many stocks’s Forward PE is single digit. Vs high 20s in US. 

3 Reasons not to buy. 
1. It’s Chinese. 
2. It’s Chinese. 
3. It’s Chinese. 


TLDR. Got greedy + cocky and lost it all. But I’m glad I lost it all early rather than later. I made a comeback over the past 10 months. Betting on Chinese stocks now. Still 100% on options. ",10-01-2024,positive

"Joby Aviation: Flying Cars and Flying Too Close to the SunEver since The Jetsons, people have dreamed of flying cars. Now, thanks to advances in electric motors and battery technology, we're finally on making them real. But the path from science fiction to viable business is rarely straightforward, and the emerging eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) industry faces some interesting challenges.

# The Opportunity

The potential market for eVTOLs is enormous. Morgan Stanley estimates it could reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. That's the kind of number that makes investors' eyes light up. But as any experienced founder knows, a big potential market is just the beginning.

What's exciting about eVTOLs is that they represent a genuinely new category of transportation. They're not just incrementally better helicopters or planes - they're a fundamentally different way of moving people and goods. This creates opportunities not just for the companies building the aircraft, but for an entire ecosystem of supporting businesses: vertiports, air traffic control systems, maintenance services, and so on.

# Market Overview

The eVTOL landscape can be broadly categorized by product, application, and operation. From the simplest helicopter-like configuration to the more advanced tandem tilt-wing architecture, these designs are based on both innovation and market considerations. 

Pivotal's BlackFly, for example, is the first eVTOL aircraft to be both commercially sold and delivered to an individual.

* Its unique tandem wing architecture offers several key advantages including reduced manufacturing cost, fewer potential failure points, and fewer design complications, especially relative to tilting-rotor configurations.
* Its ease of transport and launch-30 minutes to be deployed via 16-foot trailers - and its triple modular redundancy to prevent failure have garnered it interest from the US military as well.
* While its cost of $190,000 is much higher than even a premium car, it does come in at a lower price than certain small aircraft.
* However, as this industry is primarily focused on carrying multiple passengers, the lack of scale and smaller capacity per craft will always limit it's total market share.



# Industry Landscape and Competitive Analysis

Key players in eVTOL market can be categorized as follows:

Pure-play eVTOL companies:

* Joby Aviation
* Lilium
* Archer Aviation
* Volocopter
* Pivotal

Traditional aerospace companies:

* Airbus (CityAirbus)
* Boeing (partnership with Wisk Aero)
* Embraer (Eve Air Mobility)

Automotive and technology companies:

* Hyundai (Supernal)
* Toyota (investment in Joby)
* Intel (investment in Volocopter)

While Pivotal and others have targeted the individual consumer by emphasizing aircraft like the BlackFly, a substantial portion of the industry is concentrating on manufacturing aircraft designed for urban air taxi services, which we'll dive into in the next section One of the most prominent players in this space is Joby Aviation.

# Joby Aviation: A Pioneer Facing Headwinds

Emerged as a frontrunner in the eVTOL race, becoming the first company in the sector to go public in 2021 through a SPAC merger. Initial investor hype propelled its stock to over $14 per share, reflecting some reddit and legit excitement in the nascent industry. The company, founded by JoeBen Bevirt, has spent years developing its eVTOL aircraft, securing partnerships with industry giants like Toyota, and making significant progress toward FAA certification.

However, cracks started appearing in Joby's narrative. The company's early financials were marked by heavy R&D expenditures and substantial operating losses. Moreover, Joby's marketing efforts seemed to outpace its technological development, as seen in costly Super Bowl ad spots while still generating very low revenue. CEO Bevirt's grand pronouncements – envisioning Joby as the **""FedEx, Southwest, and Tesla of flight""** appeared detached from the company’s product focus, raising concerns about a diluted vision and unrealistic expectations. Savvy investors recognizing these warning signs began shorting the stock, further contributing to its decline, trading at $5 per share, which is less than one-third its original valuation, as of 2024.

# Dissecting Financials and Technology

* **Technology**: Joby's eVTOL utilizes a unique tilt-rotor configuration, allowing for vertical take-off and landing while transitioning to efficient forward flight. This design combines the benefits of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, optimizing both maneuverability and speed. The aircraft's electric propulsion system offers environmental advantages, reducing noise and emissions.
* **Funding and Development**: Joby's journey has been marked by substantial funding, including investments from likes of Toyota Motor Corporation and Intel Capital. The company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger in 2021, raising significant capital to further its development efforts.  However, despite these significant investments, Joby has faced challenges in meeting its initial timelines and achieving profitability, primarily due to high R&D and testing costs. As of 25 September 2024, Joby's market capitalization stands at approximately $3.69B (down from $6.6B - valuation at IPO), reflecting investor uncertainty about the company's long-term prospects.
* **Strategic Partnerships**: Joby has forged key strategic partnerships, including a collaboration with Delta Air Lines to integrate eVTOL services into Delta's existing transportation network. This partnership aims to provide seamless connectivity for passengers, expanding the reach and accessibility of Joby's UAM network. Joby has also partnered with Uber to integrate its air taxi services into Uber’s ride-hailing platform.
* **Challenges and Opportunities**: Joby faces similar challenges to other eVTOL developers, including regulatory hurdles, infrastructure development, and public acceptance. However, the company's strong financial backing, strategic partnerships, and focus on commercialization position it as a significant player in the evolving UAM market.
* **Market Demand and Performance**: The broader market for urban air mobility is still in its nascent stages, with commercial operations yet to commence on a significant scale. However, the increasing interest from established players like Delta, Uber and Joby, along with rising consumer demand for faster and more convenient transportation options, suggests a substantial growth trajectory for the industry in the coming years.

# Challenges and Lesson Learned:

The eVTOL industry's primary challenges extend beyond the issues faced by individual companies like Joby.  The sector must navigate several key hurdles to achieve widespread adoption and profitability.

* **Regulatory Frameworks:**  Establishing clear and consistent regulations for eVTOL operations, including air traffic management, certification standards, and pilot licensing, is crucial for ensuring safety and fostering investor confidence.
* **Public Acceptance**: Addressing public concerns about noise, safety, and privacy is crucial for gaining the social license to operate and fostering widespread adoption of eVTOL services.
* **Economic Viability**: Achieving profitability for eVTOL operations will require careful management of costs, including aircraft manufacturing, maintenance, and operating expenses.  Pricing strategies must also balance affordability for consumers with the need to generate sufficient returns for investors.
* **The Value of Strategic Partnerships**: Joby's collaboration with Delta and Uber underscores the importance of strategic partnerships in navigating the complexities of a new industry like UAM.  Collaborating with established players can provide access to resources, expertise, and existing customer bases, accelerating market penetration and adoption
* **The Importance of a Realistic Vision**:  Joby's overly ambitious initial vision, attempting to be everything to everyone, highlights the need for a realistic and focused approach to market entry.  Concentrating on specific use cases and target markets can enhance the likelihood of success in a competitive landscape.

# Investment Considerations and Valuation Approaches

Given the pre-revenue nature of most eVTOL companies, traditional valuation metrics are of limited use. Investors should consider:

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**:

* Projecting future cash flows based on market size estimates and company-specific factors
* High discount rates to account for technology and market risks

**Real Options Valuation**:

* Accounting for the value of strategic flexibility in an uncertain market

**Comparable Company Analysis**:

* Utilizing metrics from adjacent industries (e.g., electric vehicles, aerospace)
* Key metrics: EV/Total Addressable Market, Price-to-Book

**Milestone-based Valuation**:

* Assigning value to achievement of key technical and regulatory milestones

# My Long View

Despite the challenges, I'm optimistic about the future of eVTOLs. The potential benefits in terms of reduced traffic congestion, faster emergency response times, and new transportation options for underserved areas are too significant to ignore.

But it's going to take time. The winners in this space will be the companies that can combine technical innovation with business acumen and regulatory savvy. They'll need the patience to navigate a long and complex development process, and the flexibility to adapt their strategies as the market evolves.",09-25-2024,positive
"RIVN vs. TSLA - Rivian Target - $45+, Tesla ? Rivian has a market value currently around 12B –  right under 12/sh, and could easily double from here and further be worth $45+ over the next couple years as deliveries increase – it's an early Tesla play, with growing momentum in their production and excitement for their pipeline. 

It trades at a fraction of the valuation metrics Tesla does in every sense, but Rivian has an exciting pipeline coming and is the shiny new product non-EV and EV owners alike are excited for. 

Compared to Tesla’s delays and pushing off robots and everything else, Rivian is actively growing and has a great pipeline over the next 2 years.   
   
**Bear case** –  

Rivian is burning too much money, and losing on every vehicle sold, and will ***FAIL*** –  

Burning money is not sustainable, and I agree. *But will it actually fail*?   
   
They are still early in ramp with higher production costs, but building more of a car than Tesla offers and working with less subsidies than Tesla originally had. Yet, they have key production growth, and are prepped for the acceleration of their product demand with both commercial vehicles and consumer vehicles.  

**Factory Upgrades and Focus on Margin**

Rivian has guided towards seeing better margins this fall, in part from the re-tooling seen this last May. [Normal Site Retooling](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/rivian-completes-plant-retooling-pivotal-to-profitability/715673/) 

They are continuing to invest in their site, with approved plans to build out a larger space and prepare for R2 production, both of these upgrades leading to over 215,000 units of capacity across the R1 / R2 / Commercial platforms they offer. [R2 Site Expansion](https://electrek.co/2024/08/20/rivian-rivn-approved-major-plant-expansion-r2/#:~:text=Rivian%20gets%20the%20green%20light%20for%20massive%20plant%20expansion&text=The%20amendments%20to%20its%20site,ft%2C%20or%20roughly%205%25) 

Further, the VW Partnership further mentioned below has already brought tailwinds and initial cost savings, and will likely further support long term profitability. [VW Partnership Cost Savings](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/rivian-supplier-cost-savings-vw-partnership-earnings-q2/723660/)

**Production Analysis** 

Recently in another group, a user posted their production analysis, and it’s following Tesla’s quite well: [Rivian vs. Tesla Production Ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1f2yk9y/comparing_rivian_and_teslas_production_ramp/?share_id=67dj9Qr_8DjKXpFglZzfQ&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) 

While Rivian is still early, they’ve already shown what the R2 ([R2 / R3 walkthrough with RJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Gt_PUyldc) ) and R3 - ([R3 Design walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoBBibT_IAI)) -  will look like, and people are EXCITED for them to come out in 2026 (R3X potentially fall '26 or later).  

While we see headwinds in the EV industry, as time goes on EV infrastructure will continue to increase, furthering EV adoption (including Rivian).  It doesn't seem like Tesla will be the only pure-play EV company to survive.

So who is buying Rivians currently?  

Tesla owners, among others. More Rivians are being sold, and they are starting to be a choice among Subaru owners (a sticky owner usually), Tesla owners trading up, and even first time EV owners. Plenty of people from EVs to ICE vehicles are trading up and into Rivians, and are loving them!  

It makes sense the love for Rivian current owners have – it is a beautifully designed vehicle around the user, made with intelligent features people love to use from adventuring to everyday driving. 

Importantly, it’s also built around the technological architecture of the vehicle. Instead of other vehicles with 100 different computers that don’t talk well with each other, Rivian is building each platform as a tech-first platform, which is why VW – who has struggled with their own software and advancing tech internally – has partnered with Rivian, to the tune of $5 Billion when the company was worth $10 Billion.   
   
VW still has $4B more to invest in Rivian, so adding that to the $8B in cash they had as of their last earnings report, and Rivian is worth more today and long term. 

**Partnerships** 

Rivian has some large backing, between the Amazon contract they are producing for, and the VW Rivian Partnership. VW is a large player with many brands like Porsche, VW, Audi, and more – but they’ve struggled trying to build better tech internally. For a group seeing headwinds in the industry and China, partnering with Rivian isn’t a risk they would take if they didn’t need to – while the partnership is important for Rivian, it’s incredibly important for VW as well, including the level of due diligence needed for a $5B investment in Rivian. ([VW Struggles with Software](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/07/11/volkswagen-rivian-joint-venture)) Notably, while we talk about Rivian vehicle production and ramp, it's Rivian's tech-first focus and the way they've built a vehicle around the technology which also differentiates them and attracts VW to this deal.

Additionally, while Rivian continues to produce and deliver vans for Amazon, they are now also able to sell similar vans to other companies. While Amazon was the first, this adds to the moat Rivian is working to develop that defends their positioning – commercial EV sale -.[Rivian Commercial Vans](https://rivian.com/fleet). As the demand for last-mile delivery grows, Rivian is well positioned to take market share in the commercial space as well as consumer space. 

**Team** 

While Tesla has a crazy cult following, combined with Elon Musk’s cult following, RJ is similarly an engineer at heart but is a down to earth guy that also has a PH.D. from MIT. His exec team has experience across the auto landscape, having experience previously at Tesla, Chrysler, Volvo, Stellantis, and Jeep, as well as Apple, JPM, and more. His team is experienced across different facets of the industry, and brings both a tech focus with auto experience into Rivian's design, production, and overall customer focus.

**Summary**

EVs have plenty of headwinds, but considering how much existing customers love the product, the excitement for what is coming for the brand, the cash on hand and backing from VW, the commercial vehicle side, and overall positioning, I think the risk is worth the significant upside Rivian is positioned for.

"Who thinks TSLA is going to miss earnings because cars are stored everywhere. TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That’s a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it’s worse. 

The entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. 

I think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his “RoboTaxi” announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the “AI” hype.

"Calling the top on $TSLA. Change my mind1. Sales. Tesla sales are down, and I think they will keep falling. There’s no EV winter, Ford etc. are doing fine. People are buying EVs, just not Teslas.

2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn’t on Tesla right now.

3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. 

4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could’ve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he’s alienated them more than ever. 

He’s also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)

5. His public (mis)behavior. Going on full jousts with the biggest western governments while cozying up with the dictatorships (Saudi, Turkey) won’t serve him. His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world’s largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov’s current situation. 

6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He’s been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it’s not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.

7. X is bleeding cash. He’ll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he’s not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won’t sell it either.

Based on the above. I call a top.

"SMCI - this is far from overSMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI’s margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary.  
I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure.

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline?  
For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited ([link to 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318292688&type=HTML&symbol=SMCI&cdn=f006c6d17a8677ce2f9e8b184a14bbb0&companyName=Super+Micro+Computer+Inc.&formType=10-Q&formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&dateFiled=2024-05-06)). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more.

Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton ([“Nobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.”](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-escapes-nvidia-shadow-own-133820520.html)),one has to ask - what is really going on?

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote [mod from SCMI subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCI_Stock/comments/1emlh0s/comment/lklblb9/?context=3)) *SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins.*  
*Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.*  
Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime.

Institutions which haven't closed their positions already will have a hard time explaining why they kept their position when this stocks sinks even more.

Even insiders believe in everything so much, that the insider net stock purchases in last 12 months amount to 0. One would think that they would grab stocks with hands over fist with this ""great discount"", but I guess they don't want more shares.

Buybacks? With increased CAPEX and lower margins, the need for money for R&D, and with history of dilutions, I'd be more concerned of further dilutions.

To top it all of, in all these commotions, some of you might have missed a little interesting detail. On August 15, 2024 SMCI added Susie Giordano to it's board of directors. ([Link](https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=ce4d4770-623d-4e66-a6c9-2679d0c68221))  
Her background is law, and *Ms. Giordano has over 25 years of experience advising executive management and board directors on a wide range of topics, including strategy,* ***litigation, compliance, regulatory matters, corporate governance***, ESG, executive compensation, ***financial reporting, crisis management***\*, cybersecurity, human capital management, ***investor relations***, M&A, ***securities, shareholder engagement, and treasury matters***.  
To me, this is very peculiar timing. She gets appointed to board of directors just mere (12) days before Hindenburg reveals their report and before we find out about 10-K delay, indicating that there could be undisclosed problems and SMCI management is/was aware of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

With all that said, I am very bearish on this stock and will be buying long puts.

TL;DR: SMCI is a total dumpster fire - no moat, shrinking margins, losing big clients, and can't even get their 10-K out. Insiders aren't touching the stock, and now they're bringing in a lawyer - betting on this sinking ship with puts all day!",08-30-2024,negative
"5 reasons I’m in nvda shortNvidia’s q2 performance was great but the market was expecting it better because nvidia has been taking over Apple’s place. Tell you guys why I’m against nvidia tho this company is great and I still see the potential for the ai boom
1. Slowing down the growth : 
Like I said the market expects nvda’s higher growth. Compared to apple, Microsoft, except for the growth and profit rate, everything else is lower than the other two. 

2. Delay of Blackwell 
There’s a bit of delay of the product. No matter how early or late they can produce it. It just increases uncertainty like Tesla’s robotaxi day.  

3.  Lower net profit margin
The company still has super high net profit margin but in q2 it’s a bit lower than last quarter and it will go down next quarter too since tsmc has increased  manufacturing cost. 

4. Buyback 
It smells so sus. The company seems to try to cover something so has announced buyback while the ceo and insiders have been selling the shares and this also proves the Blackwell delay. 

5. Seasonal short month
September is one of dip months! Today the market seems alright with all the indices like jobless, pce and gdp but there’s a lot of selling. What if the market takes a break for a couple of weeks? 

This is my very personal view that have been watching nvidia since last year and missed out! But I succeed to make a profit from nvidia 3x inverse when it hit $140 and also nvidia x3 leverage when It hit $90 lately. 

I love this company but I’m trying conservatively to see into it

"Berkshire Hathaway reaches a $1 trillion Market CapWarren Buffett's company has now hit $1 trillion, becoming the first non-tech company in the U.S. to enter this exclusive club, which currently includes just six other companies, all from the tech world. To understand how significant this is, let’s see what you could buy with that astronomical amount:

* Netflix ($295B), McDonald's ($206B), Starbucks ($108B) — and you’d still have nearly $400 billion left!
* You could buy Tesla ($800B) and still have enough left to pick up Nike ($150B) for all your needs, from cars to sneakers.
* With $1 trillion, you could acquire Visa ($436B) and Mastercard ($436B), becoming the king of all payment systems, and still have money left for other investments.
* Finally, for $1 trillion, you could buy Disney ($162B), Boeing ($162B), Spotify ($69B), and Zoom ($20B) — and still have $587 billion left for other entertainment and technology ventures!

Berkshire Hathaway is now worth as much as a whole lineup of the world’s biggest brands, and that’s without being in tech. This achievement underscores the power of long-term investing and Warren Buffett’s expertise in building an empire that can compete with the tech giants.

"Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chipsNvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.

Here is how the company did versus LSEG consensus expectations:

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected
Revenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected
Nvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.

Revenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.

Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 

Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.

Revenue in Nvidia’s data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.

Not all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the company’s networking products.

Much of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidia’s chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Many customers are waiting for Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell. Nvidia said it shipped samples of Blackwell chips during the quarter, and made a change to the product to make it more efficient to manufacture.",08-28-2024,positive
"Nvidia Earnings Preview: AI Capex will continue riding the tailwind, faces Antitrust ConcernsNvidia is likely to report its fiscal 2025 Q2 earnings on Aug. 28, is poised to be one of this year's most important stock market events, and anticipation is sky-high.

**Here are Key Focal Points about Nvidia's Earning:**

With its last quarterly report, Microsoft announced AI spending is poised to continue climbing over the next year. Microsoft is widely believed to be Nvidia's largest customer, and increased spending on AI infrastructure is a clear bullish indicator. Another big customer Meta, also raised its capital-spending guidance range. Tesla had strong demands for Nvidia’s chips.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here. That should be tailwind of Nvidia shareholders.

Nvidia also reported received orders of its A800 GPU worth $5 billion from Chinese tech giants, including Baidu, ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, amid fears of the new export restrictions.

**Nvidia also faces risks:**

There may be more trouble brewing around potential production delays of Nvidia's next generation Blackwell AI chips, means revenue growth might take a hit.

There are also mounting antitrust concerns. US and France regulators are probing.

The company reaching the law of large numbers here, once a company gets to a certain size, it just physically can't keep up the same growth,"" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.

"Why Ouster (OUST) is winning the Lidar cage match**What is Lidar?**

* Chatbots are great, but Lidar is the key to unlocking AI's potential in the real world. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is like bat echolocation with lasers, for a precise 3D model of the surroundings.
* Humans are squishy! So autonomous machines must track their environment with 100% reliability. But cameras fail in certain conditions, as seen in this [Tesla dashcam](https://x.com/greentheonly/status/1473307236952940548).
* Ouster has honed the long-term winning type of Lidar.

**Why OUST's variant of Lidar is the future**

* OUST specializes in [multi-beam flash Lidar](https://ouster.com/insights/blog/how-multi-beam-flash-lidar-works), which enjoys structural advantages in cost, compactness, durability and power efficiency. Historically, it lacked the range of legacy designs with moving parts. However, OUST has finally closed this performance gap. 
* OUST's approach uniquely benefits from advancements in the consumer electronics industry, which drives down costs while improving performance, a-la Moore’s law. See: laser printers, fiber optics, VR headsets, FaceId, fitness trackers and smart glasses.
* Ouster’s DF2 sensor has 240 meters of range and will be sold for automotive use in 2025.

**A clear path to profitability**

* OUST sells to customers across 15 industries, versus relying on one aspirational auto partnership. This creates stable revenue and strong pricing power, generating the cash to achieve automotive-grade performance. Their sensors already power [Amazon’s latest warehouse robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/OUST/comments/15upziw/amazon_robot_fleet_and_how_its_extending_to/).
* OUST already makes money on each LiDAR unit sold, with +29% gross margin in 1Q24. Whereas their US competitors lose money on every LiDAR unit sold (i.e., gross margins below -80%).
* Last year, they launched a complementary software product (BlueCity) with recurring, high-margin revenue. Customers love it because it reduces the time-to-value for OUST sensors.
* OUST is close to breakeven, with $4.7m in cash outflow in 1Q24 and $189m in cash reserves. So they won’t need to raise debt or significantly dilute shareholders, unlike competitors with huge interest payments and quarters of runway left.

**Attractive entry price, with insiders buying ahead of today’s earnings release**

* OUST shares fell 33% since mid-July for no fundamental reason. Just the Yen carry trade unwind and terrible 2Q earnings from Lidar competitors. Like [Luminar Technologies (LAZR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR/) who reported a 22% sequential rev decline, dilutive debt restructuring, new debt with a 14% interest rate and -88% gross margins.
* Insiders doubled-down on OUST by [buying shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/oust/insider-activity) on May 15th, halfway the quarter whose results come out later today.
* OUST guided to $110m revenue for 2024 (+40% y/y), gross margins in the mid-high 30s and profitability by year end. **Given they beat guidance the past three quarters, today’s market cap of $500m may never be seen again.**

**Risks to thesis:**

* While Hesai (HSAI), a Chinese manufacturer, enjoys higher revenue thanks to automotive contracts, their 2Q revenue declined y/y and the US military labeled them a national security risk.
* OUST lacks major automotive partnerships, which can generate huge amounts of recurring revenue upon commercialization. However, their first sensor optimized for this space, DF2, will be sold in 2025.
* A recession could slow down investments in industrial automation, delaying their path to profitability and requiring shareholder dilution. On the flip side, this would probably kill their debt-laden, negative gross margin competitors.
* Stock is up 56% YTD still! But this seems warranted given repeated revenue beats, gross margin expansion and a successful merger (Velodyne) with $120m in cost savings ahead of schedule.

**Disclaimer:** Ouster is a risky investment, and I hold over 25% of my portfolio in OUST. This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before making any investment decision.",08-13-2024,positive

Wells Fargo ($WFC) must face a lawsuit over sham job interviews


Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger?

Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.

Inflation: Cooling Off

Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks.
Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.

Risk Management Reboot

With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.

Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.

The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.


McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble

By the Numbers

Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)
Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)
Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)
U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%
International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%
International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%

McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.

Value Meals to the Rescue

The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet.

Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.

Defying the Odds

Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.

Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell.

Looking Forward

The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.

So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

On The Horizon

Tomorrow
Economic Data and Earnings

This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.

Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Before Market Open

Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.

Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry.

Lets take $1 per month for ASTS per user

$3.36billion/year multiplied by whatever EBITDA multiple you want. We've gone conservative so far, why stop now, let's go x10? = $130 share price.

Those numbers only consider commercial cell coverage. ASTS already have military revenue, they already have interest from other goverment services.

I can sell you a more realistic number, but I'm giving you a shitty easily obtainable scenario. Come on, $1 per month per user??

(3) CEO Musk also said he wants a 25% stake in the company, before attention turns to achieving its AI goals - further uncertainty for investors. **My thoughts?** AI advancements has and will continue to be the main driver for Tesla - and (3) just adds to the negativity surrounding already weak results.

"Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI EraWhenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",07-03-2024,positive
"Diversify once you hit a gain % threshold?Hey everyone, I’m 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I’ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it’s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else.

"Musk/Tesla Insider trading question\*\*I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn't give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry.

Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.

I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?

Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?

"NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV MarketInvesting in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

"Are EVs a bad investment right now?The EV industry, previously recognized as an area of growth and technological advancement, now appears to be under considerable pressure. Recent developments reveal a general downturn across the sector, with Tesla, one of many players, implementing significant job cuts. The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.

Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.

I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it's running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all!

Don't get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It's scams all the way down!",03-31-2024,negative

"S&P 500 really has too much NVDAI'm really starting to get scared by the euphoria in the markets right now and when the fed does cut rates sometime someday if they even should with the markets doing this exuberant... it just seems like the market is peaking or peaked today. 

&#x200B;

I don't know what the better move is. 30% Russel 5000, 30% DOW Jones, 30% 5.0%+ Certificate of Deposits? Maybe some Nasdaq exposure - QQQ is probably overvalued as well but it has a broader market picture than S&P 500... This NVDA hype just seems like Bitcoin or Tesla and there is no way that this lasts - Tesla and Bitcoin both crashed and have yet to recover. Bitcoin if anything is rejecting 53k and it looks a lot like October 2021 - so I think the ""halving high"" is already in - I already sold anything I had in crypto so I'm ""safe"" from that mess.

What stock have you lost the most money on (realized or unrealized or both)I’ll go first. For me it’s Tesla. I always seem to buy right before a 30% drop and sell right before it goes on a run. I’m not as confident in TSLA long term as say NVDA or MSFT. This leads me to jump in and out more than I normally would.

"What industries are you most bullish on this year? Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?I’m paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track & trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.  
The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).

  
EV’s are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There’s not much to compare it with and no, it hasn’t been “priced in”.

  
Also, let’s not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We’re seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).  
I’m currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:  
$ALB - My safety net play  
One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).

  
$LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play  
One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I’ve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company/stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource. (Lithium carbonate equivalent). For context, anything worth 1million tonnes is likely to attract major institutional capital.  
Does anyone else share by bullish outlook? What are your 2024 lithium/metals bets?

"Tesla stock grab ultimatumI just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is (practically) demanding he have his voting power **doubled** in the company. This after he sold huge chunks, such as to finance buying Twitter. 

>  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company’s stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.

> “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.”

So the 2nd block he’s essentially threatening to spin off and make competition. 

But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?

Is this some insider key to the sell off they’ve been experiencing? Cuz it’s frankly scary to me. And it’s scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company. 

OR am I blowing things out of proportion? I admit I don’t follow the company religiously and for all I know musk makes a post like this every month.

* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.
* **AMZN** \- Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now.
* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.

"Tesla Soars to Best Day in 11 Years After a Blowout Quarter> Tesla Inc.’s shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.

> Third-quarter results were buoyed by Tesla turning a corner with the Cybertruck, which generated profit for the first time. Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla’s best quarterly earnings in more than a year.

> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025, citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. “Something like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess,” he said on a webcast.

> Tesla’s shares jumped 22% Thursday in New York, the biggest gain since May 2013.

"Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental creditsTesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla’s growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla’s bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

"Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google’s self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that’s over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google’s search business is under threat, it’s important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and AtlantaUber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips—exclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo’s co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

The competition in the self-driving space is heating up, and Uber's latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robotsRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since MayWaymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

"Are You Proud of the Companies You Invest In?Hey!

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",05-26-2024,positive
"We are at the declining/cool down phase of TechWe have had a crazy run since October of last year and it seems now we are cooling down for the foreseeable future in major tech stocks. 

Summary: 

- UBS downgrades rating on Big Six tech companies (excluding Tesla) to neutral from overweight.
- Grouping includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
- The group has dropped 8% from its April peak, having surged 117% from Jan. 2023 lows.
- Nvidia fell 10% as AI stocks retreated.
- Earnings per share growth expected to slow to 16% from 42%.
- COVID-19 pandemic caused an asynchronous earnings cycle.
- Deceleration in large cap tech and acceleration in mid cap tech may lead to a reversal in stock leadership.
- Non-tech companies expected to see earnings shift from a 3% fall in Q1 to a 19% fall in Q1 2025.

"When to sell - stocks under waterI have a decent portfolio and am working toward being more involved rather than just letting stuff sit. I have some good funds as well as stocks like Microsoft, Google, Costco, and Apple. I have some stinkers too like Boeing, 3M, and Tesla. I use Fidelity and look at the guidance that they have for the research. For the most part I am seeing that I should probably just sell 3M and Tesla but might want to hold on to Boeing as they have some potential large orders in negotiations. Tesla looks like it is going to stick until late 2025.

When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies, do you go off what they say with their research tools? If not, how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers? Better to take a loss and hope to make it up with a stronger stock? Do you utilize the investment companies to provide individualized guidance? Is that worth it?

I'm M26, **European investor**, which means I have limited access to US ETFs. I use IBKR.

I have slowly built my portfolio (image attached) over the years and I never really cared much about dividends. I also have around 40k $ in crypto.

However, recently, I decided to calculate my monthly dividend yield and it turns out I get around 100$ monthly in dividends. So now I really wanna start setting goals and hopefully reach first **500$ monthly** and later increase my goal.

I manage to save and invest 2000$ monthly. I was thinking about adding $VHYL to my portfolio.

Please help me build a more dividend aggressive strategy. I am not looking for a ready plan, but simply I'd like first to hear your opinions and feedback on my portfolio and then what you would do/change and how you would allocate the 2000$ monthly.

"Tesla: Upto 25% returns in next 15 monthsTesla [ticker: TSLA] is led by technologist billionaire Mr Elon Musk who is soon to get a plum position in the new incoming US administration.

The company has several models of EV Tesla and Cyber truck in the market.

Why do I consider Tesla as undervalued?

Tesla closed on November 8th at 321$, while the stock peaked in November, 2021 at 407$.

A 25% hike over 8th November closing comes only to 401$ which is very much achievable in nexy 15 months. 

Elon Musk in US administration will be able to influence/enact policies to shut out Chinese manufacturers while expanding its own markets in the North Americas.

Tesla is also about to roll out robo taxi service, and automatons in near future to diversify and augment its revenue stream.

Techonological break throughs at Space X are likely to rub off near future Tesla products which will help it to stand out of the (now crowding) EV manufacturers.

Chinese manufacturers may be able to mass produce cheap EVs but are unlikely to close the technological gap without access to latest AI chips.

Besides, North Americas, Tesla may also count China, EU, Middle East, India and SE Asia as its market with increasingly wealthy populace who are not shy in spending on quality automotives.

"Using options to get out of corporate AmericaHi all. I have been in high end tech sales/leadership since 2010. Been saving and investing and in 2016 I went heavy on Tesla and bitcoin. Ended up with a nice nest egg that is worth $5M right now. I’ve kept both positions and learned to write CSP and covered calls on my Tesla position. I write leaps way far otm and usually end up closing the positions for a 40-80% gain. Since I wait for the right time, for me, and write leap puts and calls I’ve been able to clear like 200k a year while my keeping my underlying stock positions. I now have like 800k freed up collecting 4%+ interest. My wife thinks I’m lazy but I only need to write calls or puts once a quarter and wait for a swing up or down to close them out. I work maybe a few hours a week keeping an eye on my companies and the overall market. I don’t let people know of my successes besides the fact that I’m an investor. Everyone thinks I need a job. If I was a bit more proactive I think I could clear 300-400k a year. What strategies would you use to go from the 200k I’m making now to doubling that?

"Invest with Henry Review. Is Henry Moldavskiy a fraud?
I was researching Invest with Henry options trading advice and it seems that virtually all of his recommendations have gotten crushed (50% - 95% loss) - GEVO, NIO, UPST, SPCE, WKHS, PLUG, HYLN, JD, BABA and many more!

I don’t understand how anyone can be that bad (especially during a bull market).

Also, I read that he lied about his experience at Goldman Sachs and was either fired or not offered a full-time position, while also learning almost nothing of value about options trading there (as he claims).

He also recommended Tesla at $230 while selling calls on NVDA at $470 and telling everyone to unsubscribe from other YouTubers if they recommend NVDA.

Some people also mentioned that he chooses option strikes using bollinger bands, that they’ve lost money following him, and that his option trading strategies are widely available for free elsewhere, so there’s no need to pay him anything.

"Can I use this naive way to decide the strike price of my LEAPS call?Hello experts I am new to option and recently I decided to buy LEAP option because I am extremely bullish on Tesla (I think it could change how human drive cars for good).

I searched many tutorial and starts to have some naive understandings of the Greeks. However I still feel confused about what strike price to choose due to my limited knowledge and I don't have much time to accumulate first hand experience on options (I have to place my oder before the IV sky rocket)

Therefore I used a retarded method to analyze the buying point. 

I first calculate how many shares I can buy with my funding and get a share number.

Then I calculated the porfit I can get when Tesla stock price hits different values and the equation is

(Stock price - strike price) \* shares number.  

And hence I get a table (I didn't finish it) and for each target Tesla stock price I can get a best strike price.

For example if I think Tesla stock price will hit $300 2 years later then I should choose strike price $175 according to the chart. The more OTM options have bigger shares number but the (Stock price - strike price) is so small so the overall performance is worse.

Can I use this way to decide what strike price to buy if I decide to keep it until the last 3 months? (I don't have enough experience to manipulate it) 

Can I do it this way? Do I miss any important things? 

This is my biggest investment so far so I really need advice to avoid grave mistake. Thanks a lot

"The best strategy of using protective putI am very bullish on Tesla stock recently after I see the performance of FSD v12. Many says this is the chatgpt moment of FSD.  Hence I recently buy a lot of Tesla shares and even utilize margin loan (1.5 leverage, maximum 30% portfolio drawdown before liquidation).

However I have no idea how much time it actully needs for the software earning to scale up and finally makes an impact on Tesla's earning report. Before that the slow down of cars saleing and unexpected economic events can drag down the stock price and hence a risk of liquidation.

To avoid liquidation I am thinking of using protective put. There are two different strategies

**A:** buy puts with recent expiry date and roll it until the Street recognizes the impact of FSD (if that really happens)

**B:** buy put with remote expiry date and sell it after the Street recognize the impact of FSD (if that really happens)

which one is a better strategy? I am new to option and has no idea. I know there are many factors to consider like the greek letters but are there any general suggestions about this?

&#x200B;

**> inb4 why don't you buy leap call option instead**

To get profit from option you have to predict price as well as time. I have no idea when the FSD can have impact on financial data and balance out the negative factors like car sales slow down. I also have no idea about the price. Tesla's price is far more expensive than car producer and hence the FSD software n’shit has been priced in more or less. A leap call with strike price $180 expiry 2026 is like $65 and the breakeven price is around $255 per share. I'd rather keep the stock and I can always wait longer time until Elon achieves the plan.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. 

The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Disney Surges On Streaming Growth

Disney posted a strong Q4, crediting streaming wins and blockbuster hits for a 6% revenue rise, landing at $22.57 billion. 

Bob Iger, back in the driver’s seat, forecasted earnings growth in the high single digits for 2025, with double-digit jumps through 2027. That news sent Disney’s stock up 9%—a glimmer of magic in an otherwise challenging media landscape.

# Streaming Soars, Cable Sinks

Disney+ and friends (Hulu and ESPN+) notched a solid $321 million in profit, even adding 4.4 million new subscribers as its ad-supported tier gained traction. 

Meanwhile, cable kept sliding, with revenue down 38% in a quarter where cord-cutting hit hard. It’s clear: streaming is Disney’s leading role now, as cable fades into the background.

# The Box Office Magic Lives On

Thanks to *Inside Out 2* and *Deadpool & Wolverine*, Disney’s studio turned in $316 million in quarterly profits, with both films setting records. As Disney eyes the holiday box office with *Moana 2* and *Mufasa*, the studio’s on track to remain a top profit machine, contributing to a 14% jump in entertainment revenue.

# Parks Keep Rolling Amid Storms

Theme parks felt the squeeze from rising costs and lower international attendance, but domestic parks held their own with solid guest spending. 

Disney forecasts 6-8% growth for the parks in 2025, banking on upcoming expansions to keep the magic alive for tourists, even as international foot traffic takes a breather.

# Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Amid Trump Win

Tesla's back in the trillion-dollar club. Shares skyrocketed 8% Friday, pushing its market cap over the $1 trillion threshold as investors jumped on the potential for looser regulations in a Trump administration. 

Elon Musk, Trump’s most vocal supporter and a generous campaign contributor, saw Tesla surge about 30% this week alone. With hints at slashing electric vehicle subsidies and potential trade barriers for Chinese EV players, Wall Street sees a Trump-Musk partnership as a boon for Tesla’s market share in the U.S.

**A Boost for Musk’s Billions**

The Tesla rally has also catapulted Musk’s net worth past $300 billion, marking his highest fortune since 2021. Musk has been outspoken about leveraging his influence in Trump’s administration to accelerate federal approval for autonomous vehicles, a critical step for Tesla’s self-driving ambitions. 

The partnership comes at a strategic moment, with Tesla now vying against Alphabet-owned Waymo in the autonomous driving race.

**Trump Trade Implications for Tesla’s Competitors**

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives noted that Trump’s pro-business stance could place Musk in a highly favorable position, shielding Tesla from new EV subsidies that have leveled the field for foreign competitors. 

Meanwhile, U.S. rivals and industry giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft now sit alongside Tesla in the trillion-dollar tech club, with Wall Street eagerly eyeing who will come out on top in this new era of deregulation.

# Retailers Are Prepping For Tariffs

Trump’s back in office, and with him comes a tariff policy that’s sending ripples through retail. With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers. 

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a “tax on American families.” Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.

**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**

Retailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers’ wallets hard. 

Stores that rely heavily on China for sourcing—like Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers—are particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.

**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**

Not every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump’s first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit. 

As some retailers scramble, those who’ve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what’s shaping up to be another trade showdown.

# The Trump Trade Is So Back

With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything. 

After Trump’s decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it’s 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration.

**Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring**

In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B

anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains—investors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride.

Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump’s pledge to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” And oil’s back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future.

**Clean Energy, Not So Much:** Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump’s clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind.

**Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:** Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It’s on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback.

**The Bottom Line:** While Wall Street’s in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be “too optimistic,” and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the “Trump Trade” seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it’s best to keep one hand on the exit.

# Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment

Betting markets took a big W this week, as former President Donald Trump’s election win confirmed what sites like Kalshi and Polymarket have been shouting for weeks: the odds were in Trump’s favor, despite what the polls claimed. With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight.

Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds. 

For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate—and maybe even profit—on real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves.

**Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious**

The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets.

Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone’s trying to cash in on this new political betting boom.

**The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting**

On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They’re worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader.

So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they’ll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s lineup starts with initial jobless claims—aka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It’s a big deal for the Fed’s next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision.

So, what’s the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It’s a smaller dip than the one in September, but that’s the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market’s been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer’s panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts.

But don’t get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell’s press conference later in the day. The man’s words and the Fed’s follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead.

# Before Market Open:

* **Planet Fitness** banks on members who sign up, then conveniently forget to show up. But the FTC’s new “Click-to-Cancel” rule could make those “set-it-and-forget-it” memberships harder to hold onto. The rule, aimed at simplifying cancellations, is still under legal review, so the company’s stock hasn’t taken a hit just yet. But if this rule sticks, Planet Fitness might need a new game plan to keep revenue pumping. Analysts forecast $0.58 EPS and $285.87 million in revenue. ($PLNT)

# After Market Close:

* **Pinterest** has been on a wild ride lately—a strong spring, followed by a tough summer slump thanks to lackluster guidance that sent shares tumbling. But now, with the stock looking relatively cheap, investors are tuning in to see if AI can be the growth engine Pinterest needs.

# Election Day Showdown: Trump vs. Harris And Your Portfolio

It’s finally Election Day, and after a campaign season that brought us viral squirrels, bear sightings, and unexpected pet memes, we’re getting back to the real talk: What does this mean for the economy? 

Trump and Harris are pitching policies that could shake up your portfolio—here’s a breakdown of their promises, from taxes to trade and everything in between.

**Big Tax Moves**

Both candidates are waving different tax flags. Harris wants to roll the corporate tax rate up to 28%, targeting high earners with a minimum 25% tax on mega-wealth (those with over $100 million) and boosting capital gains for millionaires to 28%. 

Trump, on the other hand, aims to lower the corporate rate to 15% for U.S.-based manufacturing and continue the individual and estate tax cuts he pushed in 2017. For big companies, these tax changes could directly affect their bottom lines, impacting market values and shareholder earnings.

**Tariffs & Trade**

Trump's plans are bolder when it comes to tariffs, proposing a 10% across-the-board levy on imports and up to a 200% tariff on Mexican-made cars. The goal? A “Made in America” resurgence, though economists warn this could send prices up across consumer goods. 

Harris hasn’t proposed anything quite as drastic but has hinted she’d maintain Biden-era tariffs. While Trump’s approach is all about pushing U.S. manufacturing, Harris’s steadier stance may appeal to those wary of increased inflation risks.

**What’s Next for Your Portfolio?**

Analysts suggest a Harris administration could benefit clean energy, healthcare, and homebuilding sectors, while Trump could mean gains for oil, financials, and crypto. 

But here’s the kicker: No matter who wins, staying diversified is key. Historically, the market has weathered administrations of all stripes and come out on top, and experts say focusing on long-term investments over election reactions is a winning strategy.

**The Bottom Line:** Campaign rhetoric is one thing; actual policy is another. Congress has a knack for turning grand ideas into smaller compromises, so while the headlines might sound big, the reality might be more tempered. As we head into a period of potential market jitters, a steady hand and a diversified portfolio might be the most presidential decision you can make.

# Boeing Ends Crippling Strike as Workers Accept Latest Offer

After a 53-day standoff, Boeing’s machinists are ready to trade picket signs for power tools again. In a nail-biter of a vote, 59% of union members gave the thumbs-up to a new contract that includes a hefty 38% pay bump over four years. '

Boeing’s production lines can finally get back in gear, which means more jets—and less red ink.

**A Deal That Soars Higher Than a 737**

This new contract is a big win for Boeing’s workforce. We’re talking a 13% instant pay boost, with average salaries climbing to around $119,000 by the end of the deal. Plus, there’s a $12,000 signing bonus to sweeten the pot. 

After years of less-than-stellar raises, machinists have muscled in some major gains—though it did take seven weeks of picketing and freezing fingers to make it happen.

**New CEO, New Strategy, and a Costly Pause**

For Boeing’s new CEO Kelly Ortberg, it’s been a turbulent start. Since August, he’s been cutting costs, raising cash, and trying to stay aloft amid production halts and stock hits. The strike alone was draining Boeing of $100 million a day—something the jet giant could hardly afford as shares plummeted over 40% this year. 

The settlement is welcome news, but getting production back up to speed won’t be instant, especially with 737 MAX orders still lagging.

**What’s Next: Planes, Patience, and Recovery**

Machinists will be back on the factory floor this week, but don’t expect planes to roll out overnight. Boeing’s whole supply chain, from fuselage makers to flight-schedule-hungry airlines, took a hit during the strike.

Ramping up production will take time, and Boeing’s finances are far from stable, with the company still predicting a cash flow drought through 2025.

The bottom line? Boeing may have scored a truce with its workers, but it’s still got plenty of turbulence to ride out on its journey back to cruising altitude.

# Tesla Notches a Blowout Quarter on Strong Sales, Credits

Tesla is back in the fast lane. 

The EV giant reported third-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations, clocking in at 72 cents per share and ending a four-quarter losing streak. 

Demand for Tesla’s cars rebounded in a big way, with CEO Elon Musk forecasting a potential 20-30% growth in deliveries next year. Shares surged 12% in late trading, marking a sharp turnaround for the stock, which had been down 14% this year.

Tesla’s quarterly win wasn’t just about sales, though. The company raked in $739 million from regulatory credits—selling them to carmakers who need help meeting emissions targets. It’s clear that Tesla’s profits are being boosted not only by the cars on the road but also by the deals happening behind the scenes.

**Driving Growth with New Models and Margins**  
Musk’s big plans don’t stop there. Tesla reiterated its commitment to rolling out more affordable models by 2025, while its futuristic Cybertruck is finally profitable after a production ramp-up. And there’s more good news: Tesla’s gross margin (excluding credits) jumped to 17.1% from 14.6% last quarter.

The company is also steering full throttle into autonomous driving. Musk teased a robotaxi service, set to launch in Texas and California next year. If the tech holds up (and regulators play ball), this could be a game-changer for Tesla’s future business model.

**What’s Next?**  
While Tesla’s recent results are impressive, challenges lie ahead. T

he company faces stiff competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, along with legacy brands such as Ford and GM stepping up their EV game. Tesla also needs a strong Q4 to top last year’s deliveries, and heavy price cuts could keep pressuring its margins.

Still, with its sights set on affordable models and a driverless future, Tesla seems ready to ride out the storm. Investors are watching closely to see if this momentum can carry the stock even higher.

# Arm to Scrap Qualcomm Chip Design License, Feud Escalates

Arm just threw a major curveball at Qualcomm. 

The UK-based chip designer is pulling the plug on a key license agreement, giving Qualcomm 60 days to fix their messy legal spat or risk losing access to critical tech. 

Qualcomm, known for powering most Android smartphones, might be forced to stop selling its flagship processors if it can’t resolve the issue.

This isn’t just a minor tiff—both companies took a hit. Arm’s shares dropped 6.67%, and Qualcomm’s fell 3.8% as the markets weighed the potential fallout of this escalating feud. If the license gets scrapped, Qualcomm’s $39 billion chip business could be on the chopping block.

**Why the Beef?**  
The bad blood dates back to 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm for breach of contract over its acquisition of Nuvia, a chip-design startup. 

Qualcomm says the lawsuit is just Arm trying to strong-arm (pun intended) them into paying higher royalties. Now, Arm’s stepping things up by threatening to cancel Qualcomm’s rights to use its chip architecture.

Qualcomm has big plans for Nuvia’s tech—its AI-driven PC processors are already hitting the market. If Arm’s move sticks, Qualcomm may need to scrap Nuvia’s designs entirely, a costly setback that could give competitors a golden opportunity.

**What’s Next?**  
With a December trial looming, many see Arm’s license termination as a bargaining chip to gain leverage. 

Qualcomm, however, is no stranger to courtroom drama, having settled disputes with Apple and Nokia in the past. A settlement seems likely, but if not, both companies could face serious damage.

Also on the radar: new home sales for September, with hopes of a slight rise from 716,000 to 720,000, and the S&P’s Purchasing Manager Index for services and manufacturing. Let's see if these numbers bring some real movement.

# 🎶 Starships Were Meant To Fly Be Caught

SpaceX just pulled off a literal grab for the history books. During Sunday’s Starship test, the Super Heavy booster returned to Earth and was *caught* by giant ""chopstick"" arms attached to the launch tower. 

This first-of-its-kind move is another step toward making space travel more reusable and cost-effective, a goal that Elon Musk has been chasing like a kid after ice cream on a hot day.

It was a picture-perfect flight: The Super Heavy booster detached from Starship at an altitude of about 40 miles, did a U-turn, and headed back to the launchpad. Instead of landing on legs, like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets, it steered into the waiting arms of the chopsticks. Cue the cheers at mission control.

**Why It Matters**  
Reusability has always been SpaceX’s secret sauce. Traditional rockets? One and done. But Musk has been adamant that rockets should be like airplanes—you don’t throw them away after one trip. By catching the booster, SpaceX moves closer to making rapid, low-cost space launches a reality. 

This isn’t just about saving money—it’s a crucial step toward launching multiple missions in a single day.

This booster recovery milestone is also a win for NASA, which is banking on Starship to land humans on the Moon by 2026 as part of its Artemis mission. With Sunday’s success, SpaceX is proving that its reusable rocket tech isn’t just sci-fi fantasy anymore—it’s happening.

**Eyes on Mars**  
But don’t think Musk is stopping at the Moon. His ultimate goal? Sending humans to Mars. SpaceX has its sights set on launching five uncrewed Starship missions to the red planet in the next two years. Each test, like Sunday’s catch, brings Musk closer to making that dream a reality. 

So, while the Super Heavy booster’s flawless return is impressive, it’s just the beginning of SpaceX’s larger cosmic ambitions.

# Earning’s Season Is Here

Earnings season is upon us, and after a $9 trillion rally, 2024’s bullish run faces a reality check. Analysts are calling for just a 4.3% profit bump for the S&P 500 this quarter—the weakest growth we’ve seen in a year. Expectations have been on a diet, too: Back in June, experts were predicting a solid 8.4% rise. 

But don't lose hope just yet—this is Wall Street, where surprises lurk around every corner. Remember the first quarter when projections were bleak but profits soared 7.9%?

Despite the low bar, the S&P 500 has been climbing like it’s auditioning for an action movie, hitting fresh highs and clocking a 22% gain in 2024 so far. It's the best start since 1997, and some investors are betting this could lead to an earnings surprise, just like earlier this year. The optimists might just have a point.

**The AI Party Slows Down**  
Speaking of action movies, the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—are still the stars of the earnings show. Together, they’re expected to post an 18% profit rise, but don’t get too excited: their growth rate is slowing. They were churning out over 30% increases last year, but this quarter, the AI-fueled party is looking a little more low-key.

For the rest of the S&P 500, it’s a bit of a grind. Profits outside of the tech bubble are set to rise just 1.8%. But hey, a win’s a win, right? And looking ahead, analysts expect much stronger numbers in early 2025, with double-digit growth on the horizon.

**A Stock Picker’s Playground**  
Here’s where things get spicy: this could be a *stock picker’s* paradise. While overall market volatility is snoozing, individual stocks are gearing up for some wild moves. Bank of America’s data shows that post-earnings swings could be the biggest since 2021, so if you can spot the winners and losers, you might just walk away with a big payout. 

Tech, communication services, and healthcare stocks are expected to shine, while energy stocks may take a hit as crude prices slide.

**Margin Watch and Election Talk**  
As earnings trickle in, one thing everyone will be keeping an eye on is profit margins. The forecast? A slight dip to 12.9% from last quarter’s 13.1%, as companies face rising input costs. But don’t sweat it too much—margins are expected to rebound soon enough.

Oh, and let’s not forget about politics. With the U.S. presidential election around the corner, corporate America is getting nervous. Mentions of ""election"" on earnings calls are up 62% from four years ago, and history suggests investment could take a breather until the dust settles.

Earnings season kicks off tomorrow, and it’s poised to send some ripples through the markets.

Expect some surprises and volatility as the numbers start to drop—this is when things get interesting.

# Before Market Open:

* Warren Buffett seems to be cooling on **Bank of America** ($BAC), offloading shares consistently for months. While that’s hardly a confidence booster, shareholders shouldn’t panic just yet. Interest rate cuts and AI developments could still bolster the bank’s long-term outlook. Plus, recent earnings from major banks signal stronger net interest income across the board. Analysts are expecting $0.77 EPS on $25.31 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile, **Albertsons Companies** ($ACI) has left investors anxiously awaiting news on its potential merger with Kroger. The deal has been in the works for two years, but even if it falls through, Albertsons remains a strong player in the grocery space.

"How to find upcoming stock events?Hi everyone,

This may seem like a stupid question but does anyone know any good sources to find upcoming events for a company? I'm an options trader and took a credit spread trade on Tesla and uber this week. All was going well until Tesla announced the CyberCab at their auto show event and the stock tanked 10% overnight - totally ruining my spread. As a result investors shifted their money to competitors like Uber and that jumped 8% over night - also destroying my play there.

My problem is that I did not know about this auto show and was not able to find out about it until after it happened. I took these trades because I initially thought there wasn't much going on this week and the stocks would most likely trade sideways. I don't mind taking risks just as long as I know what the risks are, but I got blindsided by this one. 

My question is, how do you find out about upcoming events like this? Are there any good resources you guys use to stay up-to-date? I want to make sure I know all the variables next time I take a trade.

# Chase A Check… Or Maybe 3 Years In Prison

Hold onto your debit cards, folks! Chase Bank has come forward to debunk a viral trend that’s been circulating on TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). The so-called ""glitch"" that supposedly lets users deposit fake checks and withdraw real money? Yeah, not a glitch. It’s fraud.

Over the weekend, videos flooded social media with users claiming they could deposit phony checks at Chase ATMs and withdraw the funds before the bank caught on. Spoiler alert: it’s a crime. Chase quickly addressed the situation, reminding customers that this is fraud, ""plain and simple."" The bank's message was clear—no matter what TikTok tells you, check fraud is still very much illegal.

# Check Out the Reality Check

Despite what the hype might suggest, this isn't some revolutionary new money hack. The tactic of depositing fake checks and withdrawing cash before they bounce is as old as checks themselves. Fraudsters usually pull this off by opening accounts under fake names, but this time around, people tried it with their own accounts—making it super easy for Chase to identify and slam the door shut.

In a statement, a Chase spokesperson said, ""We are aware of this incident, and it has been addressed."" Translation: We caught on fast, and we're not amused.

# TikTok’ers Learn the Hard Way

The internet had a field day with this one. What started as videos of users showing off stacks of cash quickly turned into clips of them facing massive negative balances and holds on their accounts. One user summed it up perfectly: “Chase Bank glitch? No, that’s called fraud. You went to the bank and took $50,000 that didn’t belong to you. That’s not a life hack; that’s called robbery.”

So, here’s the takeaway: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to real jobs or legit side hustles, and leave the check fraud to the scammers. They’re not going to win any awards, but at least they know what they’re signing up for.

# Dollar Tree Earnings Disappoint — Stock Falls Sharply

# By the Numbers:

* **Stock Drop:** -22%
* **Q2 Revenue:** $7.38 billion (vs. $7.49 billion expected)
* **Q2 Adjusted EPS:** $0.97 (vs. $1.04 expected)
* **Revised Full-Year Revenue Forecast:** $30.6 billion to $30.9 billion (down from $31 billion to $32 billion)
* **Revised Full-Year Adjusted EPS:** $5.20 to $5.60 (down from $6.50 to $7.00)
* **Same-Store Sales Growth:** +0.7% overall; +1.3% at Dollar Tree stores; -0.1% at Family Dollar stores

Not everything is priced at a dollar, including Dollar Tree’s ($DLTR) stock, which plunged over 22% on Wednesday after the company slashed its full-year outlook. The discount retailer blamed rising pressures on middle- and higher-income customers who are feeling the pinch and spending less on non-essentials.

# What Went Wrong?

Dollar Tree had to face some harsh realities this quarter. The company now expects its full-year net sales to come in between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion, a drop from the previously anticipated $31 billion to $32 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were also revised down to a range of $5.20 to $5.60, from a higher $6.50 to $7. Not exactly the kind of news investors were hoping for.

So, what’s causing all this trouble? According to CFO Jeff Davis, the company is dealing with softer sales, especially on the discretionary side—basically, anything that isn't an absolute necessity. They’ve also had to pay more in costs related to customer accidents at their stores and expenses from converting 99 Cents Only stores. Not the most fun way to spend your cash.

# Dollar Stores Aren’t Feeling So Discounted

Dollar Tree isn’t the only one feeling the burn. Last week, Dollar General also cut its full-year forecast, noting that its core customers are feeling financially squeezed. Meanwhile, big names like Walmart and even online newcomers like Temu are capturing the attention of budget-conscious shoppers.

For Dollar Tree, same-store sales in the latest quarter inched up by just 0.7%, with the Dollar Tree stores themselves seeing a 1.3% rise and Family Dollar stores dipping slightly by 0.1%. The modest gains are a clear sign that customers are tightening their belts and making fewer trips for non-essentials.

# Facing Headwinds and Hard Choices

Beyond consumer belt-tightening, Dollar Tree is grappling with some company-specific challenges. It’s shutting down about 1,000 underperforming Family Dollar stores and might even sell off the Family Dollar brand. This move comes after struggling to integrate the grocery-focused chain, which it bought for nearly $9 billion in 2015.

On top of that, the company’s dealing with a slew of liability claims from customer accidents, which are proving to be more costly and unpredictable than expected. These added expenses aren’t doing any favors for their bottom line.

Dollar Tree is hoping that the back-to-school season and upcoming holidays might give them a boost, but with consumers being extra cautious with their spending, it might take more than just a sale on party supplies to turn things around. Until then, it’s clear that not even Dollar Tree can escape the effects of a tough economic climate.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow's lineup has the labor market taking center stage with two big headliners: the ADP Employment Report and initial jobless claims, both dropping bright and early.

First up, the ADP Employment Report—our monthly pulse check on private sector hiring. Last time around, the report showed 122,000 new jobs, paired with a 4.8% bump in annual pay. Decent stats, but they didn’t exactly get economists popping champagne. For July, the forecast is a bit more festive, with predictions of 140,000 new jobs.

On the flip side, initial jobless claims will tell us how many folks filed for unemployment benefits last week. The latest count was 231,000, a slight dip of 2,000 from the week before. The experts are crossing their fingers for a further drop to 225,000 in tomorrow's report.

# Before Market Open:

* **Nio** ($NIO) has been on a rough road this year, heading mostly downhill. The Chinese electric vehicle maker is facing fierce competition at home, struggling to turn a profit, and consistently falling short on delivery targets. With so many strikes against it, Nio isn’t exactly inspiring confidence among investors. Unless you’re feeling particularly adventurous, this might be one to watch from the sidelines for now. The consensus is a loss of $0.31 per share on $2.44 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Broadcom** ($AVGO) has lagged behind its AI-driven peers this year, despite delivering robust earnings. Investors have been cautious due to the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy, which has significantly increased its debt load. However, management is confident that these moves will drive substantial sales growth and strengthen the balance sheet in the future. Wall Street seems optimistic, with 22 out of 23 analysts rating the stock a buy and setting an average price target 27% above its current level. The consensus calls for earnings of $1.09 per share on $11.71 billion in revenue.",09-05-2024,negative

"Stock Market Recap 08/23/2024: Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come + SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn Mission Will Attempt The First Private Spacewalk Next Week# Markets

* Investors celebrated on Friday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at upcoming interest rate cuts, signaling a potential end to the central bank’s aggressive stance on inflation. Powell's comments, made during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, lifted stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.5%, the S&P 500 rising 1.1%, and the Dow Jones climbing 1.1% to its second-highest close ever. 
* Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell didn’t spill the exact timing or size of the cuts, but his comment that “the time has come” to ease up on rates sent a clear message: the inflation fight is wrapping up, and the economy is looking solid. Investors loved it, and stocks rallied across the board while bond yields took a dive. Looks like the market’s got something to smile about heading into the weekend!

# Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come…

Drumroll, please! Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just dropped the mic at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, announcing the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates. Yup, the big pivot is here. After two years of cranking up rates to tame inflation, Powell is officially ready to start loosening the purse strings.

# Breaking Down the Big Shift

In what has to be the least surprising surprise of the year, Powell confirmed that rate cuts are coming soon, saying, “The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Translation? The Fed is done playing the inflation-fighting game and is now turning its attention to preventing a meltdown in the job market.

And Wall Street heard him loud and clear. Stocks jumped, with the Dow climbing over 400 points and the Nasdaq up by about 1.5%. Investors are stoked, Treasury yields are dipping, and everyone’s feeling a little lighter—except maybe those holding cash.

# So, What’s the Game Plan?

With inflation cooling off and the job market starting to look like a sad trombone, Powell’s got his eye on rate cuts. The big question now is: How much and how fast? The next Fed meeting in mid-September is shaping up to be a real cliffhanger. Will they go for a cautious quarter-point cut, or do they swing for the fences with a half-point slash?

As always, it’s all about the data. Powell didn’t spill all the beans, but he made it clear the Fed will be watching the numbers closely. A few more weak jobs reports, and we could see some serious rate-cutting action.

# What Does It Mean for You?

Well, if you’ve been sweating those sky-high interest rates on your mortgage, auto loan, or credit card, there might be some relief on the horizon. But don’t pop the champagne just yet—Powell’s not exactly rushing to the finish line here. Rate cuts will likely be gradual, and the Fed’s going to take it slow and steady to avoid rocking the boat too much.

So, keep an eye on those economic reports, stay tuned for the next Fed move, and maybe start planning what you’ll do with those extra dollars in your pocket. A new plant for the office? That fancy coffee machine? The possibilities are endless, but the rate cuts? Not so much. Let’s see how this one plays out!

# Polaris Dawn Mission Faces Brief Delay Before Historic Spacewalk

The Polaris Dawn mission, which is set to make history as the first space mission featuring a spacewalk conducted entirely by non-government astronauts, has been delayed by 24 hours. Originally slated for launch early Monday, the mission is now scheduled for liftoff on Tuesday at the earliest, according to SpaceX. This minor setback is all part of ensuring everything is perfect before this groundbreaking flight.

# What's the Plan?

Once it gets the green light, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will carry the all-civilian Polaris Dawn crew aboard the Dragon spacecraft to an altitude of 870 miles above Earth. This marks the highest any human has flown since the Apollo missions of the 1970s. The team will then descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth, where they will spend five days conducting scientific experiments and testing new technologies, including a laser-based satellite communication system using SpaceX’s Starlink.

But the highlight of the mission will undoubtedly be the spacewalk, set to be the first-ever performed by private citizens. This ambitious feat will require the entire Dragon spacecraft to be depressurized, a risky maneuver given that the craft lacks an airlock. As a result, all four crew members, led by billionaire entrepreneur and mission commander Jared Isaacman, will don SpaceX’s new EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) suits and be tethered for safety as they venture into the vacuum of space.

# A Mission for the Books

This mission isn’t just about making history for the sake of it. The Polaris Dawn crew, which includes Isaacman, retired Air Force lieutenant colonel Scott “Kidd” Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, aims to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight and gather valuable data for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The team will navigate through the Van Allen radiation belts—regions of intense radiation that pose significant challenges for deep space exploration—while testing the limits of their new spacesuits.

Despite the slight delay, anticipation remains high for what could be one of the most significant milestones in the burgeoning era of commercial space exploration. As Isaacman and his crew prepare to take civilian space travel to new heights, the world will be watching closely, eager to see this next chapter in human spaceflight unfold.

# Next Week

Next week’s economic calendar might kick off with some lightweights, but the real action comes on Friday. Monday brings us durable goods orders, Tuesday features the consumer confidence index, and Thursday rounds out the preliminaries with the advance goods trade balance.

Then, it's showtime: Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report takes the stage. This is the last PCE reading before the Fed’s September meeting, where they’re expected to cut rates. How much they cut—25 or 50 basis points—could hinge on what this report has to say.

# Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO to Brew Up a Turnaround

Starbucks ($SBUX) just swapped out its CEO like a barista switching out coffee beans. Laxman Narasimhan is out, and Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle ($CMG) chief, is in. Investors responded like they’d just had a double shot of espresso—sending Starbucks stock up a whopping 24.5%.

# From Burrito Bowls to Coffee Cups

Niccol is no stranger to turning things around. At Chipotle, he led a massive comeback after the food-safety scandals, transforming the burrito chain into a digital ordering powerhouse and boosting its stock by about 800%. Now, he’s trading guac for frappuccinos, with the challenge of revamping Starbucks’ sluggish sales and clunky operations.

# Brewing Up Big Changes

Starbucks has been struggling with long wait times and fewer customers, especially as inflation bites into coffee budgets. Narasimhan tried to caffeinate the company’s sales with higher-priced drinks and digital orders, but it backfired, leading to his abrupt exit. Enter Niccol, who’s expected to bring some of his Chipotle magic—think streamlined operations and a revamped digital experience that makes ordering and picking up your coffee as effortless as grabbing lunch on the go.

But it’s not all smooth sipping ahead. Niccol’s got to juggle the demands of activist investor Elliott Management and Starbucks’ not-so-retired founder, Howard Schultz, who’s still lingering like the smell of burnt coffee beans. His mission? To deliver on some more realistic goals, unlike the lofty ones Schultz set, which sent Narasimhan packing.

# Chipotle’s Loss, Starbucks’ Gain

Meanwhile, Chipotle’s stock took a hit, dropping 7.5% on fears that Niccol’s departure could shake up the burrito biz. But analysts are confident that the team Niccol built will keep Chipotle rolling.

So, should you bet on Starbucks? Wall Street seems to think so, with analysts upgrading their ratings faster than a barista pumps out pumpkin spice lattes. Niccol’s got the skills to grind out a Starbucks revival, but he’s got a tall order ahead. Stay tuned—it’s going to be a wild brew.

# CPI: The Fed’s Next Move Hangs in the Balance

Tomorrow’s CPI report is the main event everyone’s been waiting for—think of it as the Super Bowl for inflation watchers. With today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) coming in cooler than expected, all eyes are now on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to see if inflation continues to ease up. Economists are expecting a 0.2% bump in both the headline and core CPI readings, with year-over-year inflation holding steady at 3%. If those numbers hit, the Federal Reserve might finally be able to shift its focus from fighting inflation to tackling other economic challenges—like that pesky slowing labor market.

# What’s at Stake: A Green Light or a Roadblock?

Here’s why it matters: If CPI plays nice and comes in as predicted, it could be the green light for the Fed to start cutting interest rates, something Wall Street has been anxiously waiting for. The Fed has been in inflation-fighting mode for what feels like forever, but with the unemployment rate creeping up, there’s growing pressure for them to pivot. Jim Baird, Chief Investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, put it simply: “Inflation is almost a nonissue at this point. There’s this broad expectation that the worst is easily behind us.”

But don’t pop the champagne just yet. If CPI surprises us by coming in hotter than expected, it could throw a wrench in the works and reignite those dreaded stagflation fears—a combo of rising prices and slowing economic growth that’s basically the financial equivalent of a horror movie. While some experts think stagflation fears are overblown, a surprise in the CPI could still send markets into a tailspin and force the Fed to rethink its next move.

# The Fed’s Next Move: Rate Cuts or More Tightening?

So, what’s at stake? A lot. Markets are already pricing in a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, but tomorrow’s CPI report could either seal the deal or flip the script. If inflation stays on the down-low, the Fed might finally be able to take its foot off the gas. But if prices start heating up again, well, we might be in for a bumpy ride.



# Home Depot’s Reality Check: Deferral Mode Activated

# 🛠️ By the Numbers:

* **Comparable Sales:** Down 3.3% (7th consecutive quarterly decline)
* **Revenue:** $43.18 billion (vs. $43.06 billion expected)
* **Earnings per Share:** $4.67 (vs. $4.52 expected)
* **Outlook:** Sales now expected to drop 3-4% this year (previously forecasted 1% decline)

Home Depot ($HD) is feeling the squeeze as consumers tighten their tool belts. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations for earnings and revenue, the home improvement titan had to cut its full-year sales forecast, blaming a “deferral mindset” among customers who are holding off on major projects until interest rates stop giving them heartburn. It turns out, people aren’t as eager to remodel their kitchens when borrowing costs are sky-high.

# Seven Quarters of Slumps—And Counting

Let’s talk numbers. Home Depot’s comparable sales have dipped for the seventh straight quarter, with a 3.3% decline this time around. Blame it on consumers who are spending less and waiting more. While pandemic lockdowns had everyone rushing to Home Depot to spruce up their spaces, today’s economic uncertainty has them second-guessing that new deck or bathroom redo. Instead, they’re opting for smaller, wallet-friendly projects—like painting a wall instead of tearing it down.

# Betting Big on the Long Game

But it’s not all doom and gloom. Home Depot is playing the long game, investing in its professional customer base and digital capabilities to weather the storm. The recent $18 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution, a supplier to professional contractors, is a big move in that direction. These pros are less likely to delay projects, making them a more reliable revenue stream. Plus, with investments in supply chain and digital infrastructure, Home Depot is setting itself up for future growth once the economy gets its groove back.

So, while the immediate future might look a little shaky, Home Depot is banking on a rebound—whenever that might be. In the meantime, they’ll keep hammering away at those long-term strategies.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the spotlight shifts to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the big brother of today’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report.

CPI tracks the price changes of goods and services that hit your wallet directly. It’s a crucial gauge for the Federal Reserve as they monitor how their battle against inflation is shaping up. In June 2024, CPI climbed 3% year-over-year, following a 3.3% rise in May. For July, economists are betting on another 3% annual hike with a modest 0.2% increase from June.

Given the market’s volatility, a higher-than-expected CPI could trigger a wave of selling, while a lower number might spark investor enthusiasm, inching us closer to the Fed dialing back interest rates.

# After Market Close:

**Fed Keeps Rates Steady, But September Cut Looms**



Jerome Powell took center stage at the Fed’s July meeting, setting the scene for what could be a rate-cutting September—if the data plays nice. While Powell didn’t drop any explicit hints, his optimism on falling inflation and a cooling labor market has Wall Street betting on a September rate decision.

Here’s the scoop:

September Cut in the Cards? Powell kept things ambiguous but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The Fed had a “nice conversation” about it, and while a 50 basis-point move isn’t likely, Powell left the door open for action if conditions warrant.

A Delicate Balancing Act: Powell described the decision-making process as a “very difficult judgment call,” outlining scenarios from multiple cuts to none at all. The plan? If inflation keeps easing, growth holds steady, and the job market doesn’t fall apart, a cut could be on the horizon.

Dovish Vibes: Powell’s remarks leaned more dovish than the official FOMC statement. With inflation risks decreasing and the labor market softening, he’s still banking on a soft landing for the economy.

Market Reactions: The stock market loved it, with the S&P 500 inching towards its best day since February. Treasury yields dipped, and the dollar slid as traders began pricing in at least two rate cuts by year’s end.

Patience, Grasshopper: Despite the growing anticipation, Powell emphasized patience. The Fed’s dual mandate—curbing inflation while keeping employment high—requires careful maneuvering. Investors might need to wait for the weather (and rates) to cool down.

So, as summer sizzles on, the Fed’s next move is still in the oven. Keep an eye on those labor market stats and inflation readings; they’re the key ingredients for what happens in September.

  
**Meta's Q2: The Zuck Strikes Back**

Meta ($META) is having a moment. Shares popped nearly 7% in after-hours trading after the company not only beat Wall Street’s expectations but also threw down a strong forecast for Q3. So, what’s driving the hype? Let's dive in.

By the Numbers

Earnings per Share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected

Q3 Revenue Forecast: $38.5 billion to $41 billion

Ad Revenue Growth: 22% year-over-year

Reality Labs Loss: $4.5 billion this quarter

Operating Margin: 38%, up from 29% a year ago

2024 Share Performance: Up 34% year-to-date

Core Business Keeps Delivering

Despite all the chatter about the metaverse and Reality Labs burning through cash like it’s going out of style (a $4.5 billion loss this quarter, no less), Meta's core business—digital advertising—continues to deliver. Ad revenue alone soared 22% year-over-year, driven largely by the Facebook and Instagram power duo. That’s more than double what rival Alphabet ($GOOGL) pulled off with its ad sales.

On the spending side, Meta's AI and virtual reality ambitions are no small potatoes. The company is shelling out big bucks on infrastructure, with expenses expected to surge even more in 2025 as they continue to scale up. But with AI being the buzzword of the year, investors are keeping a close eye on when those hefty investments will start paying off.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's head honcho, is bullish. He’s not only talking up Meta AI as potentially the most used AI assistant by year-end but also boasting about their Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (because nothing says futuristic like AI-infused eyewear). Plus, Meta’s open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is making waves in the tech world, pushing the company to the forefront of the AI race.

The Reality Labs Money Pit

Even with all this success, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Reality Labs, Meta’s bet on the metaverse, is still a money pit, and the legal bills are piling up too. The recent $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition data is a reminder that Meta's past still haunts it.

But for now, Zuckerberg's 2023 ""year of efficiency"" mantra is paying off. Meta’s operating margin jumped to 38%, and the company’s cost-cutting measures seem to be hitting the right notes with investors. With shares up 34% for the year, double that of the Nasdaq, Meta's comeback story is one for the books.

**On The Horizon**

All eyes were glued to the FOMC announcement today, but now that the dust has settled, things are cooling off as we head into the rest of the week. We’re still on the lookout for updates with weekly jobless claims, which will shed more light on the labor market, while Q2 nonfarm productivity, ISM manufacturing, and the S&P US manufacturing PMI will offer insights into how the manufacturing sector is faring this month.

On the earnings front, there’s still plenty of action to keep an eye on.

**Before Market Open:**

Anheuser-Busch Inbev ($BUD) has seen its stock slide over the last year, largely due to a customer boycott following a controversial ad campaign. Adding salt to the wound, competitors like Diageo are also reporting weaker alcohol sales as consumers tighten their belts. Despite these challenges, BUD's brand power remains strong, and Wall Street is still optimistic, with an average analyst price target 26% higher than current levels. Expectations: $0.87 EPS, $13.56 billion in revenue.

Ferrari ($RACE) might seem like it’s in the same boat as other luxury brands dealing with consumers cutting back, but not so fast. Ferrari buyers aren’t feeling the pinch of inflation like most folks, and analysts believe the company will keep raking in the profits. Expectations: $2.23 EPS, $1.74 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close:**

Apple ($AAPL) made waves in June at its WWDC event, unveiling AI projects, new phone upgrades, payment services, and more. This earnings report will give investors a closer look at how these new ventures are impacting the bottom line. Wall Street remains bullish, with just one out of 35 analysts rating Apple a “sell.” Expectations: $1.34 EPS, $84.36 billion in revenue.

Amazon (AMZN) hasn’t seen the same sky-high gains as some other tech giants this year, but investors are still confident in its cloud business, post-pandemic profitability, and AI initiatives. And if you thought the love for Apple was strong, every one of the 39 analysts covering Amazon rates it a “buy.” Expectations: $1.03 EPS, $148.57 billion in revenue.",08-01-2024,positive
"Market Recap Today 07/29/2024The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed higher on Monday, boosted by anticipation around upcoming tech earnings. This optimism comes despite last week's selloff triggered by Tesla and Alphabet. Meanwhile, the Dow couldn't find its footing and ended the day in the red.

Treasury yields mostly held steady, dipping slightly before the session's end as investors await the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday.

What’s up ⬆️ 

ON Semiconductor ($ON) soared 11.54% after smashing analyst estimates on both revenue and earnings last quarter.

Revvity ($RVTY) rocketed 9.14% following stellar results that beat analyst expectations.

Philips ($PHG) climbed 6.04% on strong earnings despite a sales dip in China.

Tesla ($TSLA) accelerated 5.60% after Morgan Stanley analysts named it a top pick, highlighting its robust cash flow post-cost-cutting measures.

What’s down ⬇️

Reckitt Benckiser ($RBGLY) plummeted 8.65% in sympathy with Abbott Laboratories' legal woes.

Heineken ($HEINY) tumbled 8.18% due to sluggish beer sales in key markets and poor performance from its investment in Chinese brewer CR Beer.

Arm Holdings ($ARM) slipped 5.07% after an HSBC analyst downgraded the stock, citing its high valuation.

3M ($MMM) declined 1.56%, retreating after its best trading day last Friday.

Loews ($L) slid 1.47% following the announcement that CEO James Tisch will step down after 25 years.

Abbott Laboratories ($ABT) sank 0.45% after being ordered to pay $495 million in damages over risks to premature infants from its formula, far exceeding analyst expectations.

Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger?

Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.

Inflation: Cooling Off

Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks.
Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.

Risk Management Reboot

With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.

Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.

The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.


McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble

By the Numbers

Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)
Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)
Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)
U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%
International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%
International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%

McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.

Value Meals to the Rescue

The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet.

Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.

Defying the Odds

Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.

Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell.

Looking Forward

The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.

So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

On The Horizon

Tomorrow
Economic Data and Earnings

This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.

Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Before Market Open

Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.

Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a ""buy"" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.",07-29-2024,positive
"This Day In Markets 07/26/2024Stocks wrapped up the rollercoaster week with a strong finish. The Dow spearheaded the gains, soaring 700 points at one point today due to an unexpectedly mighty strong earnings report from 3M ($MMM). The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also bounced back from their recent declines.

Treasury yields dipped slightly, while gold saw a rise following the latest PCE reading. Meanwhile, oil prices fell for the third consecutive week as new economic data from China pointed to lower demand ahead.

Bitcoin experienced a significant jump today as focus shifts to the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where former President Trump is scheduled to speak tomorrow.

What’s up 📈

Coursera ($COUR) soared 44.67% due to a strong earnings report and high enrollment in AI courses.

Newell Brands ($NWL) rocketed 40.54% as the turnaround plan for the maker of household brands like Yankee Candle comes to fruition.

3M ($MMM) surged 23% on a fantastic earnings report that saw the company put some major lawsuits behind it and refocus on profits.

Bristol Myers Squibb ($BMY) climbed 11.44% on a beat-and-raise earnings report.

Norfolk Southern ($NSC) jumped 10.95% after handily outperforming expectations, though those estimates were based on a quarter that had a major derailment.

Deckers Outdoor ($DECK) rose 6.32% due to strong sales growth for its HOKA and UGG brands in its recent quarter.

What’s down 📉

Dexcom ($DXCM) plunged 40.66% after management cut the diabetes monitoring company’s full-year revenue guidance.

Weight Watchers ($WW) tumbled 12.50% after Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded the company from overweight to equal weight based on the long-term headwinds it faces from obesity drugs.

Biogen ($BIIB) dropped 7.15% after European regulators denied marketing authorization for the pharma company’s new Alzheimer’s drug.

Spot Ethereum ETFs attracted over $1 billion collectively on their first day of trading earlier this week. 

Let’s unpack everything that’s happened in the markets this week:

Ethereum ETFs Get the Green Light: The SEC has finally given the thumbs up to spot ethereum ETFs, allowing investors to buy into funds that track real ethereum, not just futures. These fresh funds pulled in a cool $951 million in trading volume on their second day—pretty impressive for what's typically a sleepy investment vehicle.

Inflation Cools Down: More inflation data came in cooler than expected. June’s PCE showed prices increased just 0.1% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year. This slowdown has investors buzzing that the Fed might actually cut rates in September, according to the FedWatch Tool.

Tech’s Rollercoaster Week: Tesla and Alphabet’s disappointing earnings reports set off a market-wide selloff on Wednesday, shaving over a trillion dollars off the market. The bright side? Other sectors are doing pretty well, even if tech's outsized presence in the indexes makes it hard to notice. Tech stocks are already starting to claw back some of their losses.

Bitcoin Conference Goes Big:Russell Brand, Cathie Wood, Edward Snowden, and Donald Trump are all on the speaker list for this week’s Bitcoin Conference. The GOP and digital asset enthusiasts have cozied up, and Trump’s Saturday speech is highly anticipated to see if he’ll reveal any concrete digital asset policies—or just more buzzwords.

Bill Ackman’s Reality Check: Bill Ackman scaled back his lofty goals this week, slashing his closed-end fund’s target by about 90%.


Busy Week Ahead for Markets

Next week promises to be a pivotal one for the markets. Not only are we hitting the peak of earnings season, but we'll also hear from the Federal Open Market Committee regarding the central bank's plans for interest rate cuts.

Following today's PCE announcement, much of Wall Street anticipates a rate cut in September. However, the most optimistic investors are hopeful that the Fed will surprise everyone and initiate cuts this month. Given that the Fed has stated rate cuts will be data-dependent, it's more likely that Jerome Powell and his team will want to gather additional data before making any decisions.

On the data front, most of next week's economic reports will focus on employment. The JOLTS report comes out on Tuesday, ADP on Wednesday, and the US jobs report on Friday.

Earnings Next Week:

Monday: McDonald's ($MCD), ON Semiconductor ($ON), Chesapeake Energy ($CHK), Tilray Brands ($TLRY), and Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM).

Tuesday: Procter & Gamble ($PG), Merck ($MRK), Pfizer ($PFE), Microsoft ($MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), BP ($BP), PayPal ($PYPL), Corning ($GLW), Starbucks ($SBUX), and Pinterest ($PINS).

Wednesday: Mastercard ($MA), Meta Platforms ($META), Qualcomm ($QCOM), T-Mobile ($TMUS), Boeing ($BA), Marriott International ($MAR), Wingstop ($WING), and eBay ($EBAY).

Thursday: Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Intel ($INTC), Toyota ($TM), The Cigna Group ($CI), Shell ($SHEL), Dominion Energy ($D), Coinbase ($COIN), Doordash ($DASH), and Ferrari ($RACE).

Friday: Exxon Mobil ($XOM), Chevron ($CVX), Squarespace ($SQSP), and Church & Dwight Co. ($CHD).

Then I got rid of my mindset to get rich fast and totally opened my mind to new stuff ! I read a lot of success stories about stock investing and trading! I studied countless of hours millionaire maker stock like Tesla , Microsoft, Nvidia and apple just to name a few! I read many books on stock market too . Then I understood that there  more chance to be successful in stock trading and investing than the famous day trading! I developed a breakout strategy to buy momentum stock when they make new high on weekly chart. It's a momentum sign when the market rise . I will do a post about my strategy soon . I am profitable now!

After all , it's logical because the 2 only factors that are proven to drive a stock price up in the long term are its sales growth and its profits growth! Add a breakout system to it can make the strategy powerful.

I saw some outstanding success stories on the stock markets with traders who turned a couple of  thousands of dollars into millions. 

I exclude crypto because it's pure gambling! I also exclude hedge funds because they are not retail investors and traders like us !

Here are some stock trading and investing outstanding success stories!

Jason Debolt : turned 30k to 12 million (Tesla)

Among them some are even billionaires. There's Stewart Horesjsi who became a retail investor billionaire , specially with his bet on Berkshire Hathaway. There is also Herbert Wertheim who is worth $5,3 billion. He made strategic bets on Apple and Microsoft ! These people are not traders ,they are long term investors ! It's to show you the power of the stock market to build wealth for an ordinary investor when he play it right! 

But when I do online research about a retail trader who made millions thanks to forex ,there don't seem to be a lot of positive results! It's weird because there are a lot of gurus that said that they are rich because of forex trading! I know that many are pure fraud!


Tell me if am wrong and if you know some retail traders who made it big in forex !

"What did i miss on this trade? (TSLA)Testing ORB strategy in 5 min TF with TSLA today and failed.

So i bought the second it broke the range upward (even tho i saw the down trend on 1h candles and determined that it was most likely gonna be a bearish open) and it quikly went down to my stop. Did i rush it and bought too soon? Or was the biggest mistake not listening to myself when i saw a down trend and buying anyways? Because even if i shorted when it broke downward i would have been stopped anyways right? Because the wick of the third candle when up quite a bit.

If i missed something that would have told me it was a bad idea to go with TSLA please tell me because i'm not sure if it's the strategy that failed or me (Guessing it was me).

"My strategy is too simple and too good to be true when automated.Hello, my strategy is very simple. It's about price action and riding with the trend.

Although I have always been struggling with the emotions and psychological aspect of trading (waiting for a setup is always the hardest part), it never failed me to give good results when I'm manual trading.

So just yesterday I tried prompting ChatGPT to code my strategy - which is a very simple strategy utilizing some default indicators from TradingView. Honestly, I'm not really surprise of the results because when I manual trade, it really works everytime.

Here are the results for the different instruments and different timeframes:

&#x200B;

All trades started from 2023 - current.

Timeframes: 1m - 5m - 30m - 1H

STOCKS: TESLA - [https://imgur.com/a/rZ1lvZT](https://imgur.com/a/rZ1lvZT)

FUNDS: SPY - [https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe](https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe)

FOREX: EURUSD - [https://imgur.com/a/eawzMNg](https://imgur.com/a/eawzMNg)

CRYPTRO: BTCUSDT - [https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe](https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe)

INDEX: SPX - [https://imgur.com/a/j7B2Nsi](https://imgur.com/a/j7B2Nsi)

&#x200B;

The strategy does not use SL/TP. It exits a trade if an opposite signal is generated, I think it's what caused the drawdowns. I'm still analyzing how I can utilize SL for this strategy. Of course I use SL/TP on manual trading. In this 'automated version' I think it's profitable because there's no emotions/psychology involved at all.

I developed this strategy on XAUUSD - 1m mainly for scalping, refined and reviewed it every weekend. Implemented it on higher TF and it works.

Now, I know it's not 100% reliable and I'm asking for your suggestions how to make sure the results are reliable. I also don't have access to deep back testing yet. Do you also know a way to convert this pinescript code to MQL5? or make an expert advisor out of it? Thank you!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I manual trade with it. This is my strategy, just automated. I'm just taking a break from trading because of my emotions and psychology. I wanted to know what will be my strategy's results if there's no emotions involved lol.

"The Dow’s Surging2024 has been a wild ride for the markets. We've seen tech stocks taking a hit, while traditional financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are soaring. And then today, the Dow breaks an all-time high, shooting up more than 300 points. Big bank earnings are driving this rally, but something’s been nagging at me.

While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are basking in the spotlight, Tesla’s been struggling—down 8.1% after rolling out their robotaxi. It’s got me wondering: Is the market getting too hyped on the banks while brushing off some of the underlying risks?

Sure, JPMorgan beat earnings expectations and raised its annual forecast. Wells Fargo? Another 5.6% gain. But when you zoom out, there’s still a lot of uncertainty hanging over the economy. The Fed's potential 25-basis-point rate cut in November could be the cushion these banks need, but it’s not a guaranteed win.

Honestly, I can’t help but wonder—am I missing something here? The Dow's on a winning streak, and major banks are leading the charge. But with mixed inflation data and the tech sector’s rocky performance, should we be more cautious?

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Are the banks really as bulletproof as they seem right now? Or are there risks we’re not seeing in this rally?",10-11-2024,positive

"FSD needs minimal lane change option I commute 80 miles a day and just need to go straight really. Before I wouldn't even put a destination because the tesla mapping has a lot of incorrect mapping causing you to exit out the carpool lane or take an unnecessary exit all together.
Additionally, here on the 15 north and south carpool lane in San Diego, we have a moving medium that adds an extra lane going south in the morning (3 lanes south and 1 north) and changes it back to 2 north and 2 south in the afternoon.

I have a Tesla Model S Plaid 2024 (and love it) but the last couple of days, the temperature have dropped to just below freezing. I schedule the car to charge at night, but two days in a row, I just got at message about the charging have stopped of unknown reasons. I use a 11Kw charger at home. SoC was 40%. SW is 2024.38.7

To night, the same happened again and I tried to manual start the charging - due to the temperature, the car started to heat the battery to improve charging and it slowly started ramping up the charge speed, but then stopped after just a minute or two. I tried quite a few times with the exact same result. I then tried to limit the amperes to just 6A and started charging - this time it went better and it charged for perhaps 5 minutes (while heating the battery) - then I increased the amperes to 16A, and it immediately stopped charging.

Next time I tried again with on 6A and the heating turned on - then I slowly increased to 7A, 8A etc and over 10-15 min to 16A - not it charges with 16A and is approaching the charge limit (I only charge to 70% as I have short day to day commute).

"Road Rage Dashcam RecordingHi Everyone,

This afternoon, I experienced a frightening road rage incident on my drive home. A driver began tailgating me, despite my staying out of the passing lane and adhering to reasonable speeds (15 mph over speed limit). When he eventually passed me, he yelled and made offensive gestures. I assumed he’d move on, but instead, he slowed down and continued to tailgate me, no matter which lane I switched to.

The driver was following me and I was worried he might have a weapon. I considered calling 911 or taking an exit to find the nearest police station but ultimately decided against exiting for safety concerns. Fortunately, I drive the Performance Model and was able to distance myself after about 10 minutes of evasive maneuvers. In hindsight, I regret not calling 911, though other drivers may have reported his behavior as it was very apparent what he was doing.

**My question is:** Is it possible to record longer events on the dash cam? I’m new to Tesla and couldn’t find guidance in the manual. This was a stressful experience, and while I hope it won’t happen again, I’d like to be better prepared.

Thank you for your help.",11-21-2024,negative

2. On that, the screen. It’s beautiful but having to look down and to the right while driving is not great. A projection to the windshield for basic data would’ve been a necessity in this car at this price, imo.

3. Parallel parking. Curb rash. I used to be a champion at parking less than an inch from the curb. I used to gently bump the wheel to the sidewalk and align. I am terrified at 10X that distance now due to the rims sticking out.

4. Burried menus. Again on the UI, you really have to read policies, enable permissions, and toggle features to get to what you want.

"2022 Y stuck on FSD 12.3.6 but it's not a bad thing except for...So I bought my first Tesla. A used model Y Performance with 52k. So far I love the car all the way around!. It is in really good condition for a used car with that many miles. 

So I decided to do the monthly FSD subscription. I am loving it! I does a very good job driving me to work 53 miles one way with back roads then freeway then city traffic. It just works! BUTTTTTT I wish they would go back to 12.3.6 and scrub the steering wheel code! If I look away it would be good enough for me. The car yells at me when I block the camera or look away so I know it is watching me so why keep the ""touch the steering wheel"" code in there? 

  
Except for that one thing the FSD is great, even the summons works perfectly fine, no curb issues and it avoids people and cars just fine. It's just the non consistent steering wheel nagging that drives me crazy!

I think the only other thing I could ask Tesla to do is roll out a ""per audio source"" equalizer setting. I use Tune-in so I can keep listening to my favorite station and it needs help with the bass side so I set the bass higher. But whne I switch over to Youtube music for a playlist the bass is crazy so I have to go in an set it. So a ""per source"" equalizer setting would be great. If the car does that then I have no found it. The equalizer stays the same. no matter what plays, including youtube vids, Hulu, Disney+ and so forth.

"Steering Alignment Error after an update and lost features -- Advice Needed!Hey everyone! Right after my car updated last night, I ran into an issue on my first drive — I got an error saying the steering needs alignment as FSD was driving me straight down a road. 😕 The strange thing is, this happened immediately after the update, and suddenly, all my Tesla features (FSD, single-pedal driving, emergency braking, drive smoothing) just stopped working mid-drive and won’t turn back on. As I was driving an alert saying to take over immediately came up. Now my Model X drives like a regular car, with all the computer features disabled. I had to pull over to figure out what was going on because the way it drove/handled felt so different, and all the alerts popping up at the same time was very confusing!

I made a service ticket with Tesla and they want to do a steering alignment? I’m wondering if paying the $275 for a steering alignment will truly fix this, or if the timing with the update suggests something else might be going on? Could a steering alignment really cause all these systems to fail at once? Any insight would be super helpful. Thank you!

here are some pictures of the errors:

"where to report navigation problem especially for online routing enabled.This is my daily commute path, so it bothers me a lot, and I ended up disabling online routing due to this problem. basically, Tesla navigation chooses very weird path whenever I enable ""online routing"" for my daily commute,  while destination is just on the straight line, it chooses the much longer route as if there is a lot of traffic on the path. obviously there is no need to go longer route, so I usually took over and force the path I think right. but the navigation chose right (more reasonable) path when ""online routing"" is not enabled.

"FSD 12.5.6.3 is a step backwards, and even dangerousI've been using FSD since I got my Model Y back in April. And for the most part, have been enjoying the overall experience. Makes my 30 minute commute to/from work more relaxing. I use it every opportunity I get.

I updated to the latest 12.5.6.3 build on Tuesday and after a few days, it is step backwards in some ways, and even dangerous in others. I have now stopped using it when my wife/kid are in the car with me.

1. My biggest quirk with it is how aggressively it slows to a stop. On most situations, when there is a red light, the car doesn't slow down to a stop gradually. Instead, it takes the top speed, then aggressively slows down to stop at the red light. My wife literally yells at me to slow down as she thinks I won't stop in time and will drive into oncoming traffic. It happened enough that she told me to stop using FSD.
2. During my drive to work, where I turn into the parking lot of my office building, the car is going 50mph. But it doesn't slow down fast enough before making the turn. I can feel the car applying the brakes aggressively at the end right before making the turn into the parking lot. It's jarring.
3. As others have mentioned, it takes freeway exits WAY to aggressively. It's pretty scary when the car feels like it's about to lose control on an exit turn.

As to the dangerous (and illegal) maneuvers.

1. On one of the street that I take on my way home, I'm supposed to make a left turn. There is a single left turn lane. The car will signal to make a left turn, but DOES NOT go into the left turn lane. Instead it slows down and remains on the lane next to it that is supposed to go straight.
   1. If the left lane signal is red, but the light to go straight is green, the car will STOP at that lane and wait to make a left. Very dangerous and of course illegal. Cars behind me stop, honk, and are obviously pissed off.
   2. If the left lane signal is green, but the light to go straight is red, the car will MAKE the left turn using the middle lane! Again, dangerous and illegal.
2. On one of the freeway exits, the car signals to make a left after it exits. There are 2 lanes, one to make a left turn and one for right turn. There were 5+ cars making a left turn. The Tesla aggressively drives fast on the RIGHT TURN LANE, but signals to turn left. It then proceeds to turn left, from the right turn lane! I got honked at, but if those cars making a left tries to get into the right lane, it could hit me.

"My Tesla with an expanding solar roof -- generates 4.5kwh per dayHello Reddit, this is an update of the last year worth of work on a personal project of mine -- placing an expandable solar array on my Tesla. And like all the past builds, the blueprints will be online for anyone to access. The last prototype Beta2 had lots of great feedback, and I am excited to share RC1 (Release Candidate 1). Officially the community is called [DartSolar](https://dartsolar.com) now, if you search online you can find our Reddit post from last year and all our blueprints.

https://preview.redd.it/wmzwpush541e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c6381084c14dc179fdd4d80426618f37c37d78

https://i.redd.it/ctxmyr9m341e1.gif

This is a 1kw solar array, composed of 6 smaller custom solar panels. These smaller solar panels are more serviceable, easier to replace, and makes it cheaper to fix. The roof rack uses custom made telescopic tubes make of aluminum (mostly), and some one segment made of stainless steel that I'm planning to replace with carbon fiber. However, when I release the blueprints I'll have the aluminum and carbon fiber specifications. You can get the blueprints of Beta2, and get these blueprints [here](https://dartsolar.com).

https://i.redd.it/aua77z4g441e1.gif

The entire design had to be aerodynamic af. I wanted no more than 2% aerodynamic drag loss. So I tested different designs on a 10-mile stretch where I would drive with the DartSolar on and off. The current model is about 1-inch tall, we created a custom made roof rack support to further decrease the height. Because the whole thing is flat we've observed 1% drag loss when driving at 30 mph, and about 2% when driving at 60 mph. In my daily commute I rarely go over 60 mph.

https://i.redd.it/77di9blfx31e1.gif

The solar panels are locked when driving by magnetic locks. That way they are very easy to open, but also the panels will not open when you're driving. In the blueprints I'll also add a mechanical lock to absolutely ensure the panels stay in place. But overall, I want the panels to open easily so anyone in my family can open and close them easily. The easier it is, the more daily use. Also, I'm excited that Perovskites finally made it to production level solar panels this year via Oxford PV. Which means that solar panels might produce 30% more power in the coming years.

https://i.redd.it/6wzwy608y31e1.gif

This is another view of how thin it is from the side. You can see the ocean behind the vehicle in between the glass top and the bottom of the roof rack. The roof rack also has four keyed locks to prevent theft. Also, the solar panels are epoxied in such a way that a thief would render the solar panel useless if they tried to lift it (the solar cells would crack).

https://preview.redd.it/uqxrmlpky31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d49cdce09e03873e3988ba45a8dac086e0283c7c

This is another angle how large the panels are. They have been designed to fit in a standard US-parking spot without the risk or hurting anyone. In the sense that the solar panels do not go beyond the shadow of the vehicle.

[Washing and drying the DartSolar](https://reddit.com/link/1gs3w77/video/8af9baxty31e1/player)

Another requirement was that the roof rack would be water resistant and be able to withstand 50 mph winds. In the video above I am soaking it, but also using a 55+ mph wind blower to dry the car. The blower doesn't even move the solar panels or the mechanics. We did a small wind test and it didn't break either. We did a failure test and each of the solar sheets that expand could hold 90 lbs. before they plastically deformed.

https://reddit.com/link/1gs3w77/video/rekf147bz31e1/player

In this video the power flow for the DartSolar is shown. The solar panels charge a power unit, and the power unit charges the vehicle -- off-grid. The power unit we use in REALLY bulky, and there are smaller ones. We use the EcoFlow Delta Pro, but you can use whichever you like. In this video you can also see the optional ""Cargo"" feature we have -- this allows anyone to also cargo about 50 pounds on top of the solar panels when driving without damaging them.

**Future goals**

If you like this concept let me know, DM me, or visit [dartsolar.com](http://dartsolar.com) to get updates. My personal goals are now to develop a version that also expands side to side, very similar to Beta2, but the expansion is only half-width, meaning instead of 6 solar panels, we will have 12. That would increase daily production to about 9kwh, and if solar panel efficiency increases with Perovskites and tandem solar cells, then that same future model will deliver a whooping 12kwh per day -- not taking into account conversion losses.

In the future I'd also like to introduce more carbon fiber into DartSolar so that the roof rack is higher allowing for more cargo weight. The Tesla roof load limit is about 155 pounds. Currently the solar panels weight 45 pounds, and the mechanics also weight 45 pounds. Introducing carbon fiber would decrease the overall weight, allowing for more cargo on the roof rack.

https://preview.redd.it/o98qklm7241e1.png?width=2299&format=png&auto=webp&s=8923de5ca6cdc775c19c1f71f7ca52e793d4bc3f

Here you can see I have loaded a ladder and a Persian rug on top of the solar panels by using the ""Cargo"" feature that has been added to this model.

Before I finish this post, I want to thank everyone in this community that has been super helpful. The amount of support was extraordinary, and quite honestly I would not have continued with this personal project without the encouragement of the members from Reddit and YouTube. So before saying goodbye, I'll leave you with a beautiful shot of me driving (while flying my DJI drone) near the beach.

"Looking for advice - Tesla model s 2016My Tesla model s 2016 has been having a ton of issues, I'm hoping you guys can give me some insight into what's happening and some suggestions. 

First off the center console no longer navigates properly. It either freezes at navigation system is initializing, or it says there is no navigation data. I've heard this was a symptom of a faulty emmc, but my car doesn't seem to have the recall for it? 

Secondly, the back door is a wall. The inside latch doesn't open the door, the outside handle does not present. I was able to open it with the mechanical override that's it. The window is rolled all the way up but the app tells me the window isn't shut every time I get out of the car. 

Thirdly, my front door is slowly becoming unresponsive completely. It started with my mirror, sometimes it wouldn't properly open back up when I got in the car so I would have to do it manually, Ive since turned off the auto folding. The inside handle has no issue but the outdoor handle occasionally fails to retract, and then wont open the car properly as if it's locked. When this happens the side panel becomes completely unresponsive and I can't open any windows or operate the side mirrors with it. It seems to me as if the door suddenly has no power at all, unless the handle inside isn't mechanical because the inside handle works in all situations. It's slowly happening more frequently like it has Alzheimer's or something it's fine some days and bunk the next. 

I'm thinking this must be an electrical issue, surely every mechanical part in my car didn't fail at the same time and only on one side. I'm not sure I can afford repairs right now and I have to get in and out of my car like 20 times a day so the door working is essential. I'm handy mechanically and have experience putting together computers so if it's something that can be fixed at home with a part let me know. ",11-15-2024,negative
"Tesla Navigation Weirdness: Why does it choose this route?
I’ve noticed something frustrating with Tesla’s navigation. Instead of taking a simple, direct route, Tesla’s nav is sending me on a weird detour that doesn’t make sense, I have the new updated Nav too. Here’s the issue:

I live in Toronto, and this is a major intersection. Maybe top 10 most popular intersection in the city.

Tesla’s navigation has me go out of the way, taking a longer path through a less major street. This means I end up having to wait through longer red light and make an unprotected left turn, which isn’t exactly safe or efficient.

In contrast, Google Maps, Apple Maps, and honestly any human would just go straight through the main intersection, saving time and avoiding the mess of the detour. It’s clearly the quicker and safer option, but for some reason, Tesla’s nav ignores it entirely.

I've checked at various times—morning, evening, 2 a.m., and 6 a.m.—and it just doesn't notice the obvious.

From start of the green arrow to end of green arrow is like 2 min drive, 5 min walk

"Tesla FSD experience Not sure if this is new, but I noticed something cool with Tesla's FSD today. Usually, it keeps extra space when passing an 18-wheeler. But earlier, on a 4-lane road, I was in the second lane with a truck in the third.

"Question for longtime owners and Tesla nerds about degradationI bought my first Tesla two months ago, a used 21 MYLR with accel boost and 20k miles for $28k. I drive a lot for work and the savings over gas is tremendous! 

I have been tracking degradation using the Tessie app as well as the energy app calculation (average consumption * projected / battery percentage) and both are showing an average of about 69.5 kWh capacity or 12.x% degradation 

I understand that is high for the year and mileage but also that every pack is unique.

My question for the long timers is, did any of you experience a high initial degradation like that, and if so did it affect the longevity of the pack? 

I typically keep cars 7-8 years and that was my intention with this one however I don’t want to face a battery replacement when the warranty is up which, at my rate of driving, will be coming up in 3-4 years. I know the packs are designed to go 300k but also that improper care can accelerate their damage.

"Disappointed with Tesla Service - Unacceptable Loaner CleanlinessHey everyone, I just had an experience with Tesla service that I need to vent about because, honestly, it’s got me rethinking some things.

So I recently had to take my Model X in for a service appointment, which has already been postponed a few times. No big deal—I know things happen, and I was fine waiting it out. Finally, the appointment day comes, and I drive 45 minutes each way to the service center, putting a good chunk of my day aside. I get there, drop off my car, and pick up the loaner.

Now, I understand loaners aren’t going to be top-of-the-line or brand new. The car I got was an older Model X with all the old buttons and features that Tesla phased out. It wasn’t a six-seater like my car (which is a hassle since I need the space for my family), but I let that slide. The outdated features and layout? Not ideal, but hey, it’s what they had available, so I rolled with it.

But then, I actually looked at the inside of this loaner… and that’s when I hit my limit. It was filthy. I’m talking chocolate wrappers, pet hair, sticky spots, and visible fingerprints everywhere. This wasn’t just a little dusty or used—it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in a long time. I mean, I bought a brand-new car just three months ago, and now I’m driving around in a car that feels like a neglected rental.

Look, I’m a Tesla fan through and through. I’m fine with delays and trade-offs, but the lack of basic cleanliness here was just unacceptable. For a company that talks about innovation and quality, this experience didn’t live up to that at all. I was expecting some level of care, especially after making the effort to go out of my way for the appointment.

Anyway, I’m reaching out to Tesla about it, but I wanted to share here. For anyone else dealing with Tesla service, just a heads-up to be aware of what you might get with a loaner.",11-13-2024,negative

"Changing winter tires voids warranty?Hi, 
I acquired a Tesla Model 3 2023 past couple of months and right now (due to winter weather conditions in EU Romania) I have to change the tires.

Unfortunately I saw that the tesla shop winter tires pack is 
1. Very expensive:))))
2. Out of stock

But I found wheels with the same specs online on different websites.

I called the tesla support for Romania and the guy in there said something like if I don’t buy the tesla approved tires it will void my vehicle warranty. 

Honestly it’s the first time I’m hearing about this. I know that it is recommended to only buy tesla approved tires but I couldn’t find anywhere info related about warranty. 

Does anyone had a similar situation and has an answer for this? :/

"Test drove a Tesla Y, sad to say, we were not fans(Repost of a deleted post in accordance with sub rules)

For years, I've been really wanting to try a Tesla Y (wife and I currently have a 2013 VW CC and 2015 Jetta), and we test drove a 2024 Model Y AWD for an overnight demo.

We went in with high hopes and came out very disappointed:

* Terrible ride quality, does it even have a suspension? We felt every bump in the road, including ones we couldn't even see. Our 2013 VW CC definitely felt better on the same roads, even the Jetta might have felt better.
* Even on smooth stretches of the highway, there was a constant bumping/lurching motion that made my wife nauseous; wasn't as extreme for me, but I definitely felt it too.
* The cabin was *so loud*! There was also this low pitch bumming/humming sound and pressure that made our ear drums hurt, especially at relatively low speeds on neighborhood roads. Road noise felt worse than the CC.
* Why are the automatic wipers turning on by themselves when there is no rain? and why does the radio come on randomly when we didn't touch anything? We had to turn off the volume completely to prevent it from turning on by itself randomly. The key card to lock and unlock was also inconsistent.
* We were hoping that FSD would save us from all these negatives. Well, on the highway it seemed OK, but based on my research it was effectively adaptive cruise control that most cars today can do decently. On surface roads it was nearly unusable - such aggressive acceleration, it was like a 0-60 demo every time the light turns green despite us trying to tune some of the knobs (reduce the relative speed limit, put it on chill, etc.). It's probably how a lot of people drive, but it's certainly not how we drive, and I don't think we'll get used to it. I remember reading someone saying it felt like a 16-year-old driving, and I can totally see that now.
* Not having 360 camera (something that I've seen pointed out in various Youtube videos) does feel like a drawback in tight spaces. Not used to the camera perspectives, and feel like there are still blind spots.
* On the plus side, we liked the size, the looks, and some of the tech (e.g. the visualization of cars around us when driving, the blindspot camera, the warning system that flagged when I accidentally got too close to the car in front of us, etc.).

How do people like their Teslas or non-Teslas? Anyone with similar experiences to us? Or did we just get unlucky with a bad Model Y?

Edit: whoa, lots of responses - thanks to everyone's response, I can't get through each one.

I will clarify about the lurching feeling: we felt it on the highway both when I was driving AND when FSD was being used and I did not have my foot on the pedal. I admit that it took me a while to get used to one-foot driving, but I thought that I had decent control of it on the high way stretch at least. However, I'm going to trust FSD as the ""right"" way to do it (as it kept it at a mostly constant speed), and if it still lurched, then that's no longer user error on our part.",11-21-2024,negative

"I went to Toyota and had the worst buying experience of my life. I ended up buying a car from “the worst” car company in America and I couldn’t be happier!A terrible Toyota experience led me to buying a VinFast VF9. 

I went to Toyota and ended up leasing a beautiful VF9. Did I make a mistake?

I went to Toyota to check out a Grand Highlander hybrid but left because of the ridiculous markup and awful in store visit. The salesperson did not know anything and he had the worst attitude every time I asked a question and gave the most passive aggressive answers

1. How many Grand Highlanders are there?
- whatever is in the lot…
2. Do you have any Hybrid MAXs?
- I haven’t checked….
3. What is the lease price?
- We don’t lease Toyotas…

I left furious because I was ready to buy today and have all my docs and everything. I let the manager know and he seemed as annoyed to talk to me as the salesman! No apologies and no help and kept trying to push me away saying things like “if you don’t like it, don’t buy it” or “go to a different dealership” etc.

Across the street, there was a Vinfast dealership and I decided to walk in and take a look because I’ve never seen a Vinfast in person. I walked in and was approached by the nicest and most friendly employee who was happy to converse with me and practically gave me a 2 hour lecture all about the company, the vehicles and their plans for further expansion into the US.

I’ve always been skeptical about Vinfast especially after the really negative reviews of the first VF8s back in 2023 but I test drove the VF9 and was blown away… The build quality and features felt so much better than the Grand Highlander it was almost incomparable. The vegan leather (vinyl lol) felt great, power seats massage heat and ventilation on all 4 outboard seats, and the panoramic sunroof really made it feel like a special place to be.

The car isn’t perfect though. The turning radius is really wide, the sound system doesn’t match the price of the car and the overall width of the car is a surprising 88in wide!!!
 
I did an extended test drive about an hour and a half to test out all the ADAS systems since those were the biggest complaints of the VF8. While it wasn’t perfect,  it does a very good job in the highway.

All that being said, I went ahead and put a $200 deposit for a VF9 Plus reservation with a green exterior and saddle brown leather interior for a 3 year lease at $600/mo. It should be arriving next week

I know it’s a risk to buy a car from a 3 year old Vietnamese company in the US, but I see them in the same position as Hyundai and Kia in the 90’s and Honda or Toyota in the 70’s. They are building their brand and they work with some the best companies like Pininfarina for design and BMW for the platform and interior, and I was told that they took an entire software department from Tesla to help improve their ADAS systems.

I feel good about it but now I’m getting second thoughts. What do you folks think?

TLDR: The Toyota car purchasing experience was so awful I bought an EV car from “the worst rated ” car company in America.  I couldn’t be happier

"MOR-EV rebate with a salvage vehicle (Does it work?)Hey, I figured I would share my experience. 

I purchased a tesla from a New Jersey dealer and ended up getting a rebate from MA through the MOR-EV program.

The experience was so good, I decided I would try something outside the box...for science.

I bought a SALVAGE title tesla FROM A DEALER in New Hampshire (argo cycles)

(from a dealer is the MOST important aspect here)

After taking deliver I spent 6 weeks restoring the car, then I got the inspection done by the state police, registered the car, and applied for MOR-EV

Originally, they gave me some pushback because the vehicle was previously SALVAGED and was now REBUILT.

but, after I pointed out the following things, the situation changed.

* There is nothing that says it CANT be a salvage vehicle in the MOR-EV guidelines
* If anyone deserves the rebate, it's the guy who saved the electric car from the landfill LOL

After 2 weeks, they escalated my case to a higher up at the Department of Energy

7 days went by, I heard nothing.

I called the MOR-EV phone number, left a voice mail and BOOM, within a few hours, my application was accepted and they just mailed me a check for $5,000

  
What is the end result?

I have a 2018 model 3 performance with FSD purchased for $11,000

"Why an EV is the cheapest car to rent at the Tulsa airport.Flew into Tulsa a few weeks ago for a 24-hour project, just in and out. Amazingly, the cheapest rental at Avis is the EV category -- not the mini clown cars that are usually at the bottom of the list. So I bit on it. Turned out to be a good deal for me, but gotta be bad for Avis.

First, I ended up with a Ford Mach-E. I liked it a lot! Especially at the super-low price I paid! Why isn't everyone taking advantage of the deal????

So why aren't they? Once you leave Tulsa (if you don't know the area) you are officially in Bumfuck, Oklahoma. EV charging stations are few and far between. I'm sure every other prospective Avis EV renter was looking at the map and going, ""Holy crap, Batman. We'll get stranded. Give me a higher-priced IC!""

Second, they don't provide an adapter so that you can use whichever network of EV chargers you come across! The check-in guy blamed Ford for not supplying it. I'm sure Ford offers that for a price and Avis just decides to F their customers by not buying it. Anyway, I was overnight at the Shangri-La resort and they offered FREE EV charging, with a Tesla system. Couldn't use it, no adapter.

The"" return-full-of-gas"" rule that Avis has on ICs is so ingrained into my brain, that I didn't believe them when they told me at rental that as long as I had 5% left upon return, I was good. As long as they had enough juice to get it to a charger they were happy. How does that make sense (thinking from an Avis income perspective)? I paid Zero for the energy to drive 200 miles, instead of $25 for gas.

I did make it back, at 15% charge, but I have to admit I was scared because I had no history of how fast the drop-off would be on the last 25%. You know what I mean. I can drive 300 miles on 3/4 of a tank in my IC, and just 35 on the last quarter tank. It turned out to be a non-issue...happily.

So Avis: 1. Provide a charging adapter!!!! 2. Add a charge station map to your app, or a link to one that already exists. You'll remove a barrier to adoption and then you can charge more for a $40k vehicle than you do for a stripped-down $20k Kia Soul.",11-04-2024,positive

"Tesla Model Y vs. Chevy Equinox EV (the family car buyer’s perspective)After much deliberation about which would be better for my small family I think we have a winner, the Chevy Equinox EV. Let me explain.

So to be exact a 2025 Chevy Equinox EV LT FWD vs a 2020 Tesla Model Y LR. The two cars I was choosing from were on the shortlist because they are the exact same price $31,000. The Chevy is new and the Tesla is used with 38,000 miles on it. 

For reference I have owned EVs for 8 years and my first EV was a 2016 Chevy Bolt. I loved that car. The only real problem was the charge speed was nowhere near where I needed it to be for long distance trips, which my family does often. I have also owned a 2021 Tesla Model 3 LR for 3 years and that car really spoiled me with its handling, acceleration, and the supercharging network is really special but it is to small for our family car. I never thought I’d buy anything other than a Tesla again but opening up the supercharging network up to non-Teslas has really got me thinking.

I test drove both of these cars and it’s pretty night and day as far as performance goes. The Model Y even has the acceleration boost upgrade. Not to say the Equinox EV wasn’t a smooth ride but it feels slow and heavy compared to a Model Y. The Model Y also felt like it had a bit more space in the trunk and more headroom. It’s a bit easier to take a car seat out also. So you’re probably thinking “what gives? Why did you decide on an Equinox EV?” A few big reasons. The first is that the Equinox was more comfortable. The seats felt better, the suspension was softer, and the infotainment was better in my opinion (something I thought I’d never say about a non-tesla) 

All in all we decided on a new car with full warranty and no wear. It was really close though and honestly in the near future I would love a Model Y or 3 as a commuter car. ",11-04-2024,positive

"Just saw a review video of the original Tesla Roadster, and EVs used to be excitingRecently I saw a review video of the original Tesla Roadster, and it was an exciting car. It got almost 250 miles of range, and it was a first gen EV. Tesla also used a normal car interior for that car, not the all touch screen garbage that they use now. It was also one of the only sports car EVs ever released. Nowadays, even on the legacy auto makers side of thing, all that's coming out is copy and paste SUVs, and most of them use a Tesla style interior without buttons for things like HVAC. Oddly enough even though touch screens are supposed to save auto makers money, lower end EVs are more likely to have normal car interiors. For me anytime I see a car without buttons for things like AC, it instantly kills my excitement for it.

Which led me to wonder since I will almost certainly buy an EV and - if the price comes down and I feel secure about the battery a Tesla - what the theft rate is for Teslas and other EVs (like KIAs).

Does anyone have some useful information.

Also, what does basic connectivity cost per month and HOW does that work? If you can just point me at a some link that explains it (I'm too frugal to buy premium, especially with how little I drive after Covid).",10-31-2024,negative

"How did the likes of Fisker go bankrupt but not VinFast?First off, I have no skin in the game for neither of these two brands. 

I like EVs and wish for them to succeed in general. 

That being said, the generalized version of my impression with these two brands are:

1. Almost everyone in Fisker subreddit saying they wouldn’t go bankrupt, then they do. 

2. Almost everyone in VinFast subreddit saying they will go bankrupt, but haven’t (or maybe not yet?). 

Before Fisker filed for bankruptcy they had a pretty ironclad fanbase. Almost propaganda-like. Dissent was basically asking to get sent to the gulag.

VinFast on the other hand, had a plethora of skeptics and continues to have them. I see them around more often now both in the SF Bay Area and OC (not nearly as much as Teslas though obviously).

"Sorry: Sorry question charging Mustang mach eI’m very sorry to bother you, but it’s a bit urgent:

I’ll cut the long story short. It is my first EV ever. We arrived 1am in Fort Lauderdale with two small kids. Avis said all they have left is the Mach E or a dodge Charger. I went with the EV and drove straight to the hotel 

Now I only have 20 miles left. Tried two chargers already. Tesla didn’t work as there is no adapter (right)? My next try was electrify America, but it was so new it wasn’t opened yet even through the car guided me there.

Couple of questions please since I have never had an EV.

What is a save bet for an idiot like me to get the car charged without problems? I can’t use more trial and error
Should I stick with one network like electrify America and do I need there app?
Is there an app that lets me use and pay at all stations?
How fast does the Mustang charge? What stations should I filter for?

Thanks to each and everyone of you. Sorry for a bunch of stupid questions

"Road trips seem a lot less stressful in ICE vs my EV6Before I get buried in downvotes and accusations of being an EV hater, I just want to say that I do really love my Kia EV6 for local driving.  The ride quality is great and the handling characteristics of EVs make it extremely enjoyable to drive around compared to ICE vehicles.  I also am very happy with it for relatively short road trips where I can charge at my destination and where I'll only need to stop once on the way, since planning alternative charging stops in that scenario is not too difficult.  This is my US-specific opinion based on living and travelling in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic US, so things may be better or worse in other countries or areas.

That said, I just did a 1300 mile (roundtrip) road trip and I have to say I'm glad that I chose to take my ICE vehicle (Subaru Legacy) instead of my EV6.  In retrospect, the trip would have been so much more stressful in my EV6 especially with the tight schedule I had.  There are three main things that I think would have made my EV6 a more stressful choice:

**1) Lack of reliable 175kW+ charger availability.**

Relative to most other EVs, the EV6 and other eGMP vehicles are capable of faster charging, and this was a huge part of the reason I got this car.  However, only a fraction of deployed DCFC stalls can actually take full advantage of this.  My EV6 can hold 230kW+ speeds for a huge chunk of the charging curve.  After perusing PlugShare, I discovered that the only places on my route that consistently had any 175kW+ chargers were the Electrify America, Pilot/Flying J, Circle K, and (weirdly) Ford dealerships.  Most of the other ""fast"" chargers were 125kW or below, often 62.5kW or 50kW.  When I'm doing a long drive in one day, I really don't like stopping for longer than it takes me to use the bathroom and grab a snack - 10-15 minutes at most.  I don't want to be stuck at a slow ""fast"" charger for longer than I need to be.  Virtually every gas station offers both 87 and 91-93 Octane gas, so I believe that every DCFC should offer at least one actually fast charger.

This won't be fixed by the Tesla network opening either, because superchargers can't do 800V which means they provide comparatively slow charging speeds to 800V eGMP vehicles.  V4 superchargers capable of 800V+ are currently vaporware since zero of them have been deployed as of today.  Having to spot-check the PlugShare reviews for each DCFC site before stopping there to avoid ending up at a ""dud"" is also pretty annoying.  I've experienced having a gas pump fail to work correctly a total of two times in my entire life.  In the 5 months I've had the EV6, I've had a charging failure due to a dispenser issue happen over a dozen times at various DCFC stations.  I realize it's a lot more complicated, but they (DCFC site and network operators) will need to do a much better job with reliability if they want people to switch to EVs.

**2) Excessive number of stops.**

At the 75-80mph speeds and 55-65F temperature that nearly all of my travel took place at, my EV6 manages 3mi/kWh (and that's if I'm being optimistic).  Since charging above 80% is slow and dropping below 10% is risky given the sparse infrastructure, only about 70% of my battery capacity is usable on a road trip (compared to 90%+ of the average gas tank).  That's roughly 160mi of usable range between stops, compared to 500+ in my Subaru.  I would have had to stop every 2 hours (likely even more frequently depending how distant the next charger was).  Additionally, many of the possible EV charging stops along my route (EA and dealerships in particular) were not really located somewhere desirable where there's easy access to bathrooms and snacks.  I understand some people might like to stop and stretch every 1.5 to 2 hours, but that's not me.  I want the drive to be over with as fast as possible and stopping makes it take longer.

**3) High DCFC prices relative to gasoline.** 

The Subaru cost between 8.8-9.7 cents per mile to drive on the highway (gas prices ranging $2.90-$3.20/gal at 33mpg), while the EV6 would have cost between 15.0-22.7 cents per mile due to the hugely variable yet consistently expensive cost of DCFC ($0.45-$0.68/kWh after sales tax at 3mi/kWh).  Even if I fully charged at home before leaving, this trip in my EV6 would have cost me almost double the cost of gas.  Gas prices were a lot less variable and did not have sales tax on top of them.  Additionally, it's way easier to compare gas prices as I don't need to go into a bunch of different apps to find the prices, I can just use one app for that.  If I want to know the price of an EA charger, I have to open the EA app.  If I want to know the price of an EVgo charger, I have to open the EVgo app.  This is a crappy experience.

At my destination there were limited options for hotels with L2 chargers.  The single hotel that did have EV charging costed $30 more per night which negated nearly all of the potential DCFC savings.  I booked that one anyway since at the time I wasn't decided on whether I was going to take the EV6 or not.  That hotel had 2 EV chargers - 1 Clipper Creek and 1 Tesla.  The Clipper Creek had a fault light on (which I expected after reading the PlugShare reviews), and the Tesla charger was in use the whole time so I wouldn't have been able to charge anyway.

**Final notes**

I do realize a lot of these issues are not as bad or may not even exist if you drive a Tesla.  I have seen that the Tesla nav does a great job minimizing unnecessary stops.  Tesla seems to also haves better efficiency and range than many comparable EVs so you can go farther between stops.  And finally, Supercharger charging cost for Tesla drivers are generally a lot more reasonable than DCFC costs for non-Tesla owners.  In my city it's 33 cents vs 56 cents.  Huge difference.  Only thing I don't like about the Teslas is the comparatively long 10-80% charging time vs my EV6.

Problem 1 will hopefully be solved if/when more gas station chains get into EV charging, so long as they don't put in ""slow"" fast chargers.  Problem 2 is solved with EVs that have larger/denser batteries and better efficiency (there are already substantially longer-range EVs that charge very quickly available on the market today, they are just prohibitively expensive for me).  Problem 3 I don't see being solved any time soon unless the government mandates open API access for live charging station data or something so that someone can make a single app to easily compare cost, which would help force stations to be more competitive with their pricing.

**TL;DR:**  America's DCFC infrastructure is still very sparse, unreliable, and expensive compared to gasoline.  Only a fraction of DCFC sites offer the high charging speeds supported by eGMP and many other 800V EVs.  Usable EV ""road trip"" range can be <60% of the advertised range due to lower efficiency at highway traffic speeds and due to only being able to effectively use the battery capacity that exists between 10% and 80%.",10-21-2024,positive
"Why do plug-in hybrids feel so underwhelming?I drive a Tesla Model 3. I always said that after this car, I wouldn't go back to an ICE. However, I've recently come around a bit, and, am tempted by some of the plug-in hybrids on the market. However, I find the range completely underwhelming. It seems like all of them have ranges around 20-40 miles on the battery before needing to use the engine.

Like my Tesla, full EVs often get 200-400 miles of range. Why aren't there more hybrids that bridge the gap between these two? I'd be way more interested in a hybrid if it had an electric range of 100-150 miles.

Is it a design limitation? Like, does the presence of an ICE take up so much space that they can't fit a larger battery in for the electric motor? Is it something we'll see much improvement on in the future, or is a design choice?",10-21-2024,negative

"EV Rental in Spain  1X1 BMWRented a mid-level BMW 1X1 in Barcelona Spain for two days for drive to small town 150km away.

The cars range is about 250 miles at 100% derating the WLPT rating to EPA.  Still hot in Spain so AC all the way.

The IX1 is a great car.  It had heads up display.  Its great when integrated with NAV and cruise control and has  become a must have feature.  Quiet, comfortable.   Regular car acceleration but that will help with range.

Charging in Spain turned out to be excellent.  Every large gas station had a couple chargers.    Typically just 50kW.  Might take extra time but that's about it.   Availability is all important. Even at 6AM I was able to get one to work from scratch, using the QR to get the app and using that for topping off for the trip after using the car the previous day.   That was the only time I needed on the road fast charging.  The town had two free L2 charges and plugged into one for the day. The Tesla S on the other charger was there when I got there and there when I left five hours later.

Parking garage in center of Barcelona had 20 chargers.  8 were just for Sixt, the car rental company, the others for the public.  When we were in the garage, always some public chargers available.  Parking garage for the car two blocks from our apartment had 2 x L2 which we used two nights.  That was super convenient having 100% charge.

Tesla chargers were available but we never got to try them out.  I have a Model 3 so ""Add your EV"" in the Tesla app was easy and it hten provide directions, maps, availability to use them.

The BMW nav app had a ""Go to charger feature"" which was good. It also had a nice feature of ""Start Preconditioning"" so could turn that on so you could charge faster.

Overall, renting an EV in Spain was easy with enough chargers to quell any range anxiety.",10-21-2024,positive
"A week with a Polestar as a Tesla ownerHertz had a good special on a Polestar down in central Florida so I rented one for the week. I've been a Tesla Model 3 owner since December 2023. 

There were some things I really liked about the Polestar (either a 2 or 4, not the SUV) and I could see it's market share growing, but I also felt some of it's limitations.

What I liked:

The in-car entertainment system being built on Google excelled compared to Tesla. Having access to google maps was a dream, and it integrated with the car's battery so I could see charging stations and battery status. 

The trunk had a spacious opening, so a device like a walker could easily be stored in the trunk, something I can't do with a model 3 due to the shape of the trunk. 

The ability to install apps opens up a huge potential for software development.

The car drove well, had a good feel to it and was overall fun to drive. 

I felt like the car was a bit higher off the road than the Tesla Model 3 is. This was nice for older riders, and I liked the grab bars, which my Tesla lacks. 

Things I didn't like: 

The most annoying thing. I had to manually select Bluetooth audio every time I began a drive. Why can't it remember? 

No Phone Control for rentals. To do this, you need both keys in the car, and Hertz keeps one of the keys. Tesla has a rental car mode that you can control a rental with your phone, so this would be nice. 

It either doesn't have adaptive cruise control or I couldn't get it to work, also missed my built in dash cam and 360cams. 

Some of the controls felt clunky, especially related to the HVAC system. 

No dog mode, it's useful for more than just dogs. 

And then the whole mess of CCS charging. Worrying about if chargers will be broke, only like one or two Tesla chargers in central Florida have the built in Magic Dock, and the prices for chargers like electrify America. Holy crap. I paid $50 for 2 CCS chargers. I'd pay half that in my Tesla. On one of my trips I drove like an extra 45 minutes to get to a CCS charger, passing a Tesla station.

Many residents aren't courteous and leave their EVs plugged in long after charging is complete without incurring any penalties from the landlords (unlike Tesla superchargers, which charge idle fees).

"Why do people like one-pedal driving?Everybody talks about this like it's the greatest thing ever. Tesla made a big deal when they added ""full one-pedal driving"" a few years ago so you could come all the way to a stop without using the brake. Reviewers take points off for EVs that don't support it. But my experience driving EVs is that I don't like it, and I turn it off whenever I can.

IMO the ICE model works well: push down on the GO pedal (accelerator) when you want to go, take your foot off the GO pedal to coast, use the STOP pedal (brake) when you want to slow down / stop. With one-pedal driving it's only really one-pedal as long as you have enough regen force to stop quickly enough. So when I'm driving I'm always having to judge whether or not the car is going to slow down enough with just regen or if I have to actually press the brake pedal. I also find it hard to modulate just enough throttle to slow down smoothly to a stop, or start out smoothly again.

So what am I not seeing? Why can't the EV give me the ICE-like experience of coasting when I let off the accelerator, use regen when I first start to press down on the brake, and then engage the friction brakes too if I'm trying to stop faster than pure regen will allow? One-pedal seems like it's just a way for the EV maker to cheat and force me to adapt to the way the car works, rather than the other way around.",10-07-2024,positive

"Will the growing EV market be GM's Renaissance?Today in Oak Brook, IL, the Chicago Auto Show had it's mini show called ""Chicago Drives Electric"".

11 different manufacturers brought vehicles ([Link](https://www.chicagoautoshow.com/about-the-show/chicago-drives-electric-2024/)) to show and offer small road tests to experience the vehicles.

I have to say between Chevy, GMC/ Hummer, and Cadillac- General Motors is producing stylish EVs that seemingly are designed well and generating buzz. I know I have heard of issues with the initial launch of the Lyriq (not sure the status of that currently), but my short driving experience today in the Lyriq has been far better than other EVs (namely Tesla and Volvo) that I have experienced so far.

Today's experience even has influenced a second consideration of Cadillac, especially if the Vistiq will be a comparable size to my MDX as an EV.

TL;DR: To my fellow EV enthusiasts, how are you feeling about GM's growing lineup? Do you think they have produced worthwhile vehicles to purchase thus far?

My question is framed from how many peers my age have been critical of GM since we watched many of our parents have GMs and Chryslers with loads of issues leading up to the bailout in 2008. I have long been an Acura/Lexus driver, but I have lost hope of the Japanese producing an EV like the MDX within the next few years and am accepting I likely will move on.

"Just bought a Onvo L60 today!Nio’s younger sibling in the house!

I woke up today and decided it was time to go out and finally buy my first car in China. I was thoroughly impressed by the L60. Benchmarked against the acclaimed model Y it is more spacious, luxurious, cheaper and more convenient. The styling is personal but I think it looks just as great, if not better. Compared to Xpeng G6, BYD Song, Denza, Nio ES/EC etc.. it seems to provide the greatest balance of design, luxury, convenience and cost.

Space: the clean interior borrows a lot from the model 3 which still has the appeal for those looking for a minimalist feel while adding some features of luxury. By far the MASSIVE 2nd row legroom and lay flat front seats are the real seller though. The car is only 8cm longer than the model Y and yet the amount of legroom achieved seems to appear way longer. Curious if anyone has a cabin cross-section comparison.

  
Luxury: the L60 comes pretty much fully loaded. Front cooled and air bag massaged seats, Heated four seats, as many cameras and 360 you'd like, pretty advanced ADAS/AD features. The fit and finish seems excellent. The quality of materials is mid-end, so a huge step-up from Teslas bare bones materials approach. 

Cheaper: here's another real winner. The BAAS system brought the car down to 149k RMB, or \~21k USD out the door. I will get to rent the battery for 599rmb a month and not have to worry about battery health maintenance degradation / depreciation due to outdated chemistries.

  
Convenience: battery swapping anyone? I'll also get to change pack size plans according to our needs. Long road trip coming ahead? Swap up to the larger pack by upgrading the BAAS rental package.

  
Only downside I can tell right now, production queue is advertised to a worst case of 2 months leadtime atm...

"Last week's high volume stocks* **TSLA -** Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, 
* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.
* **AMZN** \- Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now.
* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.
* **NVDA** \- Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week. I had given target of $154 last month and I believe it will hit that target.",11-11-2024,positive

"Tesla Soars to Best Day in 11 Years After a Blowout Quarter> Tesla Inc.’s shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.

> Third-quarter results were buoyed by Tesla turning a corner with the Cybertruck, which generated profit for the first time. Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla’s best quarterly earnings in more than a year.

> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025, citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. “Something like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess,” he said on a webcast.

> Tesla’s shares jumped 22% Thursday in New York, the biggest gain since May 2013. That helped add tens of billions of dollars to Musk’s net worth and sent the stock into positive territory for the year, erasing a slump in the weeks since the CEO unveiled self-driving taxi and van prototypes.",10-24-2024,positive
"Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental creditsTesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla’s growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla’s bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

"Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google’s self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that’s over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google’s search business is under threat, it’s important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and AtlantaUber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips—exclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla’s upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo’s co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

The competition in the self-driving space is heating up, and Uber's latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robotsRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since MayWaymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

"Rivian / The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern.# Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive?

# The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation.

[Black Swan Pattern ](https://preview.redd.it/uoymop1yx49d1.png?width=3660&format=png&auto=webp&s=63fbaa0ad8bbdfd7e3a140f33213bd35c1adb1a7)

# 

 There is a so-called Black Swan pattern, which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal. The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements.

* The smaller Fibonacci is the so-called conservative retracement.
*  The longer-term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement.

For the technical analyst, the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible (interim) price targets. In this context, the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy, structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart. 

How do you view the merger, and do you see a realistic chance for VW to assert itself against BYD and Tesla with this collaboration? The chart at least offers a perspective on a fruitful collaboration.",06-27-2024,positive

"Fear that I've already missed out (the opposite of FOMO)?I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think ""heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then, rather than buying in with that realization, I talk myself out of it. ""How much more can it really go up?"" I don't know... Examples: Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I've since watch both explode and its like ""damn! why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies?"" Those are the most obvious misses I've made.

I'm curious how you determine when you've missed your opportunity. I'm not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don't care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn't think most companies were a safe long-term bet. But, there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn't have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity, I'm like ""is now the best time to buy? Its already doubled since I was ready to enter."" 

I'm currently don't have much liquidity so I'm not buying. But, by the end of the year, I should have $20-30k freed up. And, if some of the stocks I'm currently interested in go up, I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere ""safer."" Besides the argument that over an x number of years, almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you've missed out.",06-12-2024,negative

"Are You Proud of the Companies You Invest In?Hey!

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",05-26-2024,positive
"We are at the declining/cool down phase of TechWe have had a crazy run since October of last year and it seems now we are cooling down for the foreseeable future in major tech stocks. 

Summary: 

- UBS downgrades rating on Big Six tech companies (excluding Tesla) to neutral from overweight.
- Grouping includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
- The group has dropped 8% from its April peak, having surged 117% from Jan. 2023 lows.
- Nvidia fell 10% as AI stocks retreated.
- Earnings per share growth expected to slow to 16% from 42%.
- COVID-19 pandemic caused an asynchronous earnings cycle.
- Deceleration in large cap tech and acceleration in mid cap tech may lead to a reversal in stock leadership.
- Non-tech companies expected to see earnings shift from a 3% fall in Q1 to a 19% fall in Q1 2025.
- Shift may be disruptive in the short term, but UBS reiterates S&P 500 target of 5,400 for end of year, citing positive fundamentals and a robust economy.

"When to sell - stocks under waterI have a decent portfolio and am working toward being more involved rather than just letting stuff sit. I have some good funds as well as stocks like Microsoft, Google, Costco, and Apple. I have some stinkers too like Boeing, 3M, and Tesla. I use Fidelity and look at the guidance that they have for the research. For the most part I am seeing that I should probably just sell 3M and Tesla but might want to hold on to Boeing as they have some potential large orders in negotiations. Tesla looks like it is going to stick until late 2025.

When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies, do you go off what they say with their research tools? If not, how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers? Better to take a loss and hope to make it up with a stronger stock? Do you utilize the investment companies to provide individualized guidance? Is that worth it?

Overall, this is what I wanted to see in a Full Self Driving vehicle.

However, Florida roads will have a unique challenge. Here, we use double lines on our major roads, see photo of road. I have no idea why, I assume it’s something to do with premium lanes like HOV or Express Lanes… but in this instance, the software sees 2 unbroken lines, and refuses to cross (see Tesla screen). I held off disengaging for over 3 miles, until it took me past my exit having refused to cross. It did try, by turning on the turn signal, then off, then on, then off probably 15 times… but refused to cross despite it being broken lines.

So, Florida, Tesla, community… what should it have done… and what would you suggest?

"I Host the World's Longest-Running Tesla Podcast, Ride the LightningI recognize that my weekly Tesla podcast, Ride the Lightning, might not be for a lot of folks in this sub since all of you already diligently follow all the happenings with these cars and the company! :-) But if you're interested -- or maybe you want to recommend it to a Tesla fan in your life who isn't on this sub, I'll quickly tell you a little bit about it:

Every Sunday at 9am ET/6am PT I release a new episode of Ride the Lightning: The Tesla Unofficial Podcast, in which I recap and analyze all of the week's happenings in the world of Tesla. It's roughly an hour long and I try to make it feel like a radio show -- I even have a call-in segment in the back half of each episode. I've been going every single week since 2015, and I have a blast doing the podcast.

I've been lucky enough to have Elon Musk on once, five years ago, for [episode 200](https://teslapodcast.libsyn.com/episode-200-my-elon-musk-interview).

"Introducing ZEVA - The Free Tesla Approved Third-Party Companion AppHey r/TeslaMotors,

 For today's No Shame Sunday, I'm excited to introduce [ZEVA](https://zevaglobal.com/drivers/) - a FREE, Tesla-approved Driver Companion App that's about to change the way you interact with your Tesla.

 **tl;dr:** ZEVA gives you access to data Tesla doesn't show you, helping you optimize your vehicle's performance, health, and driving experience. And you can get it for free.

 As a Tesla fleet operator, I discovered a goldmine of vehicle data that most owners never see. This realization led me to create ZEVA (Zero Emission Vehicle Analytics), designed to help every Tesla owner get the absolute most out of their vehicle.

 What sets ZEVA apart:

* **Real-Time Range Estimate:** Factors in weather, road conditions, driving habits, and even cabin temperature for more accurate range predictions.
* **Home Charging Cost Breakdowns:** Charging cost visibility isn’t just for Superchargers anymore! Know exactly what each charge is costing you, even when you plug in at home.
* **Live Monitoring:** Watch your Tesla in real-time, including speed, traffic conditions, and route.
* **Battery Health Management:** Tools to increase longevity and maintain your Tesla's value.
* **Driving Behavior Score**: Assess speed, acceleration, and braking habits to promote safer driving.
* **Trip Replay:** Relive your adventures in detail.
* **Secure log-in** using Tesla’s SSO.
* **Dashcam Video:** Our app will integrate with [MATT3R’s](http://www.matt3r.ai/k3y) K3Y, a new AI-powered dashcam solution that just launched today. The integration will let you access footage from your Tesla’s built-in external cameras right from our app.

 And that's just scratching the surface. ZEVA offers all this while maintaining your privacy - we never sell or share your personal data.

 The best part? **ZEVA's core features are completely free.** We believe in making sustainable transportation accessible to everyone, which is why we've made sure every Tesla owner can benefit from our app without spending a dime.

As a special thanks, we're offering new users’ full access to our **premium features for free until July 15th - no credit card required!** Sign up at [app.zevaglobal.com](https://app.zevaglobal.com/auth/login) for our most comprehensive experience or check out our mobile app (available on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zeva/id6476576625) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zevaglobal.zeva&pli=1)), designed for when you’re on the go. Currently available in the US, Canada, and Australia with Europe and Asia coming soon.

We're constantly evolving and improving ZEVA based on user feedback, so whether you love it or have suggestions, we want to hear from you!

Thanks for reading and we can’t wait for you to check us out!",06-30-2024,positive
"Access your Tesla cam footage wirelessly from our new AI-powered dashcam solution!Hey r/TeslaMotors,

My name is Hamid, the founder of MATT3R, a Canadian startup dedicated to making roads safer through cutting-edge AI technology. On this No Shame Sunday, I wanted to share something exciting with you all–especially Tesla owners!

🚗⚡ Introducing the K3Y: Your Tesla’s Dashcam, Supercharged with AI 🚗⚡

**What is it?**

The K3Y is a smart USB thumb drive that plugs into your Tesla’s dashcam USB port, transforming your car’s cameras into an advanced, AI-powered system accessible right from your phone. Here’s what it offers:

* **Dashcam Footage on Your Phone:** Instantly access footage of your Tesla’s front, side, and rear cameras through an intuitive map interface on your phone.
* **AI-Powered Insights:** Intelligent event detection for incidents, honks, harsh braking, disengagements and more–neatly displayed on a trip map.
* **Cloud Backups:** Automatically back up crucial footage, including AI-detected events, to the cloud when you return home on WiFi. 
* **Third-Party Extensions:** Our app will support seamless integration with other Tesla apps that you love, and future benefits from insurance and charging services.

Speaking of integrations, we are partnering with [ZEVA](https://zevaglobal.com/) (Zero Emission Vehicle Analytics), a driver companion app that provides personalized vehicle data. With this integration, requesting dashcam footage will be a breeze directly from the ZEVA app.

**Why I built the K3Y**

As a fellow Tesla owner and engineer, I wanted safer, smarter daily drives. The K3Y enhances our cars and learns from our interactions—like sudden brakes or near misses to improve the driving systems At MATT3R, we fully anonymize your data. Let’s make roads safer, one drive at a time.   

**About MATT3R**

Based in Vancouver, Canada, our team of hardware, software, and AI experts is dedicated to making roads safer for everyone. This is my third tech startup–previously, I co-founded Recon Instruments (acquired by Intel) and Novarc Technologies (pioneering AI/Robotics).

"HDMI Input for Model 3/Y!Hi all! I've recently launched a new product that lets you display any HDMI device on your built in Tesla Model 3 or Model Y infotainment display. You can hook up game consoles, laptops, streaming devices and more... pretty much anything that outputs HDMI!

The device supports full screen mode as well as a few picture in picture modes, and has tight integration to the vehicle via CAN bus (to, for example, ensure that your backup camera is always displayed if you put the car into reverse).

We're also planning some exciting additional features and inputs with future firmware updates.

"What is Teslas target audience now?Non Tesla owner doing mental gymnastics trying to understand the latest evolving landscape.

I know the obvious answer is MAGA, however pretty sure those people don’t believe in electric vehicle, Trump hates electric cars. Im not understanding the long term play here. 

Either Elon gets Trump to agree to major fleet changes in the USGOV from Ford and Chevy, to Tesla, but then that means infrastructure. 

Also changing the trucks to cyber trucks not possible due to expense unless we just want to bankrupt America further?

"Working at Tesla Energy vs. Automotive?Hello Tesla skeptic hive mind; I am considering an offer for the Tesla Energy team in Palo Alto.

All I have heard is nightmare stories about working for Tesla and a somewhat ridiculous culture - rude colleagues, insane work hours for relatively little pay, etc.

The offer I have been given is a significant step up for me, but I am dreading potentially walking into an emotionally/professionally abusive minefield.

When I met with the team in person, all but one of them were extremely professional and competent. One came across like a pretty big a-hole.

"Ashamed to own a Tesla; good alternatives?Anyone else feeling ashamed of owning a Tesla after all the bullshit Elon has done? Especially with his stance and him supporting trump and his rhetoric. I am, and I wish I hadn’t bought this car.

I have a few dumb questions as this was the first car I ever bought new.

I am hoping to sell but I know it will be tricky since I still owe money on it and last I heard they don’t retain value as well as they used to. Is this still true?

If I were to attempt to get another car would I need to get a loan that covers what I still owe plus the value of whatever car I end up choosing?

For those of you that have already jumped ship, what did you land on? If I’m being honest I’m leaning away from electric and potential choosing a Prius. I want to say I’d go electric but the only reason I went Tesla was for the supercharger network? How are the charging networks for non teslas?

* MG MG4 – 1486 sales (Sept 386)

"Looks like more owners are experiencing battery and PCS failuresEarliest Model 3s are barely seven years old.  People want to believe that there are fewer parts and repairs on their Teslas but that's likely only true when comparing them to really unreliable vehicles.

Haven't really spent much on my 14 y.o. ICEV bought new and 13 y.o. HEV (bought off a friend) besides refueling and oil and fluid changes.  On my HEV, $900-1,200 a year on gasoline expenditures.

With depreciation and repair costs, I wonder if I am really missing out any anything by having withdrawn my security deposit a year after the Model 3 unveil.

"Never again a Tesla for a reason I did not expect (even though I like my Model Y)I actually like my Tesla Model Y. I find it a great car and I enjoy driving it. Even with Musk being the idiot that he is I would buy another Tesla. But that all came to crashing halt when I saw the repair costs.  
  
If you look at the body damage there is a slight scratch on the paint in the middle. The body is slightly dented. I took this to my regular body shop who does our Mercedes cars and he said give or take about a 1,000 Euros. But he could not do the work because he is not an official Tesla place and hence cannot do the work, or will not do the work. He also indicated only get it done in a Tesla shop because of the warranty.

So I asked for two quotes and the answer was 2,380 Euros and 2,550 CHF. Are you fracken kidding me? We always fix our own little dents because our deductible is about 750 Euros. In most cases we are always below 1,500 Euros. My wifes Mercedes GLA who had a torn fender that needed replacing cost 1,350ish CHF. And that was done by Mercedes Switzerland, not exactly a cheap haven.

I said to my wife, nope never again a Tesla. She agreed because those are outrageous prices and if we have to go via the insurance our already expensive insurance will continue to go through the roof. As she said I will drive around with a dented car until the battery completely dies.

Famously Tesla still allows an open browser in North America, which is stupid enough by itself, NO web browsing!  And there are workarounds from third parties to allow video while driving.

Tesla should be duty-bound to realize and prevent this, it's widely known; not a secret hack. Also the NHTSA should mandate they turn off the web browser altogether.  It's disallowed in Australia because of distracted driving.

"The current EV Market sucks if you want a sports sedan that is affordableRight now outside of Tesla, your only options if you want a sports sedan are in the ultra luxury category. The closest cars to the model 3 are the polestar 2 and ioniq 6, and unfortunately they both have similar issues to the Tesla. The ioniq 6 has touch buttons which are pretty annoying. And the polestar 2 is really cramped inside. Then there's the issue of the polestar 2 is really heavy and can't get 300 miles of range. It's so annoying that all the legacy auto makers are copying Tesla for interior design. Oddly enough there's plenty of gas cars out there that still have tons of buttons. Right now I'm planning on sticking to gas cars till we get EV sedans that are fast and have lots of buttons. But I overall feel hopeless that will ever happen.

Instead of addressing the critique about Tesla's hardware and safety concerns, Musk opted for a personal jab. This sparked reactions noting the irony, as Tesla had past bailouts, and his non-rebuttal hinted at Levinson's valid points.

Wondering why so much range was lost in 3 years when Tesla says the battery degrades 1% yearly?

I see so much conflicting information. Sometimes it says that it’s an EPA estimate and nothing to do with battery health. Other times I read that it depends on your driving habits and the computer adjust to you. And then sometimes they read it has to do with battery health when you charge it 100% that’s when you should know.

"Elon's final play before he leaves Tesla?TLDR: Yes, I lost money on Tesla puts. Yes, the margin improvement/cost reduction is impressive. But the golden carrot he put in front of investors faces regarding a bright Tesla future is just bullshit and only serves for Musks well payed exit, if Trump wins. Then he can easily argue, that he has to leave Tesla because duty calls in the government and he never actually has to deliver. So OTM call (280) till/after Trumps win and after that put options once he announces, that he works for Trump now.

First things first, margin improvement, free cash flow and improved cost of production is very impressive and shows that the core business is doing well.

Nevertheless, this does not correlate anyhow with the stock price. So lets talk the golden future laied out in the earnings call.

* There is no way the HW3 will be able to be used as a robotaxi, he finally said that.
* They are already testing ride hailing/robotaxis with drivers --> whats the news here?! Its like any other Tesla with FSD where a driver is sitting behind the wheele.
* How the f\* does he project 20-30% growth in 2025:
   * All factories are close to max. capacity. Mexico factory is on hold, Shanghai might start soon. BUT: The economy in china is f\*. Tensions with Taiwan are rising and could escalate.
   * US sales are down.
   * The economy and EV business in Europe is struggling.
   * The 25k vehicle is canceled --> no growth here.
   * The Cybertruck is a niche product for the US.
   * There are no details regarding the affordable models. If actually starting in Q1 2025 those can only be stripped down existing models. I really doubt that people will go for those cars.
* No news on licences for robotaxis:
   * It is extremely risky to bet on the no stearingwheel/only camera approach. Everybody else uses multiple sensors and still faces situation they cant handle, especially not legally if shit hits the fan.
   * The legal issue regarding robotaxis is not solved and not in Teslas hands to solve.
   * Volume production for Robotaxis in 2026 might sound nice but as stated before, you don't know if Tesla is actually allowed to deploy them.

All those points combined with fact, that he even managed to give multiple contradicting statements during the earnings call leave me with following conclusion:

Due to the financial mess he is in with his Twitter purchase and all those unachievable promises he prepares his golden exit. He wants to push the stock as high as possible before the Trump election and will then leave since the government will call and he is destined to serve America. This way he can solve his financial mess with Twitter while saving his face. So long till the election and short after that.",10-24-2024,negative

"Long Term Reliability I've been driving a 2008 Honda Civic for probably the last 7 years, car had 95k miles when I bought it and now has 245k miles with almost zero maintenance other than routine stuff. I've recently gotten more established in my career and am in a position to upgrade since the Civic is starting to really show its age now. 

  I've considered Accord hybrids and a few others but recently started looking at Teslas because I really like the looks of the 2024 refresh (model 3). Me and the wife went and test drove one at Tesla of Knoxville Saturday and I was blown away. The interior and acceleration are insane in my eyes coming from a 2008 Civic the Tesla seems like a spaceship. 

  My only major concern is long term reliability, I'm wanting to buy new so I'll be covered by the warranty for as long as possible. It's a bit alarming though how many post I see about stuff as simple as door gasket material messing up on cars that aren't even 3 years old yet and all these model 3s that are having issues with less than 100k miles. 

  Pretty much my question is I wanna hear from the people that have had little to no issues, if you have 100k+ mile and have had no problems I'd like the hear about your experience. Also one more thing what's up with all the 2021s that are having battery issues, are the battery's in the 2021s different from other years or is the same kind of battery used in the 2024s. Crazy how many HV packs have been failing on the 2021s with low low miles.

It seems to confirm the idea that all of Elon's activities are in search of and support of SpaceX, but also that the approach behind Robotaxi and SpaceX has virtues and is potentially very smart. Though it attempts to cover the positive points of Tesla's choices fairly, I think it inadvertently makes a strong case for booting Elon. 

On the other hand, the article finally explains to me at least, why his board may be enamored enough of him to keep him on.

The money paragraph: ""The Tesla bet, though, is that Waymo’s approach ultimately doesn’t scale and isn’t generalizable to true Level 5, while starting with the dream — true autonomy — leads Tesla down a better path of relying on nothing but AI, fueled by data and fine-tuning that you can only do if you already have millions of cars on the road. That is the connection to SpaceX and what happened this weekend: if you start with the dream, then understand the cost structure necessary to achieve that dream, you force yourself down the only path possible, forgoing easier solutions that don’t scale for fantastical ones that do.""",10-15-2024,positive

"My Model Y is stressful to drive.Did a 90 mi round trip drive yesterday, I had four phantom breaking events, one with a guy right behind me. On top of that I had two warnings to take control immediately, complete with blaring alarms, and both times with my hands literally on the steering wheel. 
This was in just TACC because I find FSD just a white hot mess.  Everytime I think I can relax a little, an alarm goes off or the brakes slam on.  Not what I was promised, and not something you experience in a demo drive either.  It's only when living with it day to day the negatives really shine through.

I'm asking Tesla about a return, but barring that I'll likely sell at a loss soon and go back to an old-fashioned car with regular cruise control and limited safety systems.  I'm about 3 weeks into ownership and so far 100% of the stressors have been safety system related.  The EV portion of the Model Y is simply amazing, great efficiency and incredible power delivery. It's the safety inclusions that make it stressful to drive, the irony.

I had a Chevy Bolt for 4 years so EV driving is not new to me, but the Bolt had none of these safety or driver assist annoyances, it allowed me to simply drive it.
I just get the impression that the Model Y doesn't seem to want me to drive it, like it just wants to stay plugged into a charger and never move.

Why low profile tires? Its a taxi not a sports car ffs, why would you want to feel every lump in the road?

Why butterfly doors? Good luck getting out in a tight spot or an area with low clearance.

Why are the seats so low to the ground and why is the roof so low? Anyone who has gotten into and out of sedans and SUVs/vans knows exactly how much easier the latter is on the back and joints.

This feels to me like a clever joke, El\*n M\*sk was like, ok how do we make this as bad as possible, just to mess with everybody and he's laughing the whole ride home.

The Model Y would make a better robotaxi because it has more seating, seats at a nice height, roof at a nice height, and higher profile tires for a softer ride.

Tesla needed to do five things on Thursday: show a robotaxi, discuss entry to service, discuss safety data, provide details of its business model, and offer an Easter Egg. Tesla hit three of those five.

As for the three it hit, there wasn't much any discussion about how Tesla would enter service or details about what regulatory hurdles the company faces and how it plans to overcome them. For the two that Tesla missed, the lack of any new safety or driving data was glaring.""",10-11-2024,negative

"Review: 6 Weeks in a Tesla - WTF?!I'll preface this by saying I've never been the type to seek out reddit pages to rant, but my recent experience has turned me into one of those people. I was never an ""Anti-Tesa"" person. My opinional disagreements stem from my personal belief that hybrids are the realistic future unless this country embraces nuclear energy. I would enjoy trolling the type of Tesla owner that acts obnoxious that they are single handedly saving mankind with their Tesla but don't have an answer when you ask them where electricity comes from. 

I had been in a couple different Teslas previously but I just finished a 6 week extended rental of a 23 Model 3 while my car was in the body shop. I don't think I can encounter anything in my life that was so incredibly hyped and turned out so incredibly horrible. 

Now, I'll admit, I was in a rental (likely) base level Model 3 long range, so I'm willing to admit that my experience might have been slightly more positive in a higher end model. That being said, I am now convinced more than ever that the Tesla enthusiasts that obnoxious talk up these cars so much are nothing but rabid fan boys that are completely blind to what a piece of crap this car is. 

Despite being their ""lower"" model car, the MSRP on model I had (when new) started around 40k+. I've seen used models of the exact  i had with the same mileage (16k) for about 30k+. What I experience for a car of that price blew my mind! 

First, when I picked up the car, the drivers door made a loud pop noise when opening in. Fearing the car they gave me must have been in an accident, I asked for a different car. They showed me 2 others that made a similar sound. The rental manager informed me that most of the Tesla they've had make that noise and it was just a ""Tesla thing"". 
Onto the famous Tesla build quality. The cheap plastic panels that creek with the slightest touch. The horrible faux pleather seats and wheel. I personally hate the ipad knock off UI that you have to use for EVERYTHING, but I'll admit that is a personal preference and give that a pass. The sounds this car made with every slightest bump in the road made me feel like I was driving a 2000 Mitsu Mirage. 

While the car has some very unique and (formally) ahead of its time features that I found to be completely novelty and largely useless. (Disco lights and romance mode? Seriously?). After my extended test drive I firmly believe that the fan boys point to these unique gimmicks to cover the fact that a 40k car doesn't have many super basic features you'll find on base model Hyundai's, Hondas, or any other brand.  

First, refusing to integrate Car Play and Android auto in laughable. Its like driving a car from early 2000 when bluetooth audio was a technological gift from God lol. The built in navigation (like the rest of the car) is atrocious. No ventilated seats. Oh a glass roof, that's kind of cool, but it doesnt open lmao. The road noise was something I haven't experience on any car in the last decade. The loud whistling coming from the windows has me constantly checking that the windows were rolled up. They were, of course. I suppose windows that don't seal is part of their fresh air feature. 

I see ""Full self driving"" and think okay, this should be cool. Here is that awesome technological I've heard about. I almost pissed myself laughing when I realized it's nothing more than adaptive cruise control, which I had standard on my 2016 Civic and is not only standard, but far superior only my current 22 Honda and my wife's 22 Hyundai (not to mention insanely significantly better build quality, interior and interior materials).  Outside of engaging ""full self driving"" which seemed to mandate cruise control, the car doesn't even have active lane keep assist!🤯 Which is not only standard on my Honda and Wife's Hyndai, it works SIGNIFICANTLY better than teslas full self driving. I start to veer out of my lane and my Honda/Hyundai automatically pulls me back into place. Not to mention the active lane keep assist works at any speed and isnt something that requires cruise control at high way speeda. When adaptive cruise control is on, the car continues to steer itself, accurately, through some very strong curves and bends in the road. This Teslas FSD would disengage at the slightest bend in the road. 

I could go on and on but I've wasted enough of my time on this, frankly, really shitty car lol. 40k+ for that car is absolutely laughable. 

If electric cars are your thing, that's great. But in 2024, every single major car company has Electric cars/SUVs that are infinitely better than these overhyped cheap pieces of junk Elon is making. 

I'm trying to be objective in my review because I really didn't have any prior prejudice against Tesla prior to this 6 week rental. Maybe other than I tend to find a disproportionate amount of Tesla owners I've met to have this douchey arrogance but, to be fair, you can find that anywhere. 
So, what am I missing? Why does this company have such a large cult-like following of enthusiasts? Because what I just drove for 1.5 months was a complete POS and the entire time I wish I had taken the new Elantra or Altima they had but I wanted to see what the hype was about.

"NYT article highlights a $22,445.72 hotel payment paid by Musk's security staff.I was reading the recent article on Musk's security apparatus via the NYT and came across something very strange.

It was a segment where they said his security guys sometimes did errands for him, including paying a $22,445.72 hotel bill on his behalf for family and staff in 2016. 

This I find very weird, because firstly its a very high hotel bill. But also why is he entrusting his security staff with such a big payment?

But also, the bill was for **Musk's family and staff's accommodation at a luxury hotel.**

Are we just waiting for people to die to take it off the roads?

According to this sub it seems like most of them are lemons that need ""specialists"" to fix within weeks or even days of claiming ownership. Is that really the most common case or do we just hate Tesla/Elon and are documenting this massive failure of theirs/his?

"ApologiesTo the people and communities my choices have affected,

I want to extend a sincere apology for my role in supporting a vehicle and a vision that, on reflection, endangers more than it benefits. As a Tesla Cybertruck owner, I recognize the inherent risks my vehicle poses to others—its oversized, steel-framed design isn’t just a personal choice or a statement, but a mobile hazard that instills fear among families, cyclists, and pedestrians who share the streets.

When I first made the decision to drive a Cybertruck, I was drawn to its technological promise, its power, and its defiance of convention. But I now understand that this choice contributes to a culture of excess and dominance that dismisses the safety of others and overlooks the responsibility we all share on the road. My vehicle, with its armored frame, presents real dangers—its weight, dimensions, and visibility challenges turn it into an unyielding force that doesn’t belong in public streets. I see now that its aesthetic of invincibility, once so appealing, translates directly into risks for anyone who happens to be in its path.

I apologize as well for supporting the egotism and misplaced priorities that brought this vehicle to life. By buying into this vision, I have, in part, endorsed a mindset that values spectacle over common sense and dismisses the impact on the very communities that are meant to benefit from innovation. My choice has, in effect, contributed to a brand that places personal ambition over public safety, technology over human-centered progress.

I know that no amount of regret can undo the dangers my Cybertruck may still pose, but I commit to seeking safer, more responsible transportation. I apologize for the harm and fear my vehicle represents to so many, and I will do my part to ensure the roads are safer for everyone.

Sincerely,
A non-tesla owner that made a template you actual owners should use.

Feel free to edit

>*The windshield wiper was replaced under recall with a faulty wiper that is actually more dangerous than the original and Tesla is known about this issue for months and haven't corrected it or stopped replacing working units with faulty ones. Please HELP with this issue before someone gets injured or killed by their negligence. I have made multiple attempts with Tesla service and tried all their contacts and am getting zero resolutions.

>NHTSA ID Number: 11612607
>Incident Date September 3, 2024
>Consumer Location OAKLAND, CA
>**Summary of Complaint**
>*We were driving on the freeway yesterday September 3rd at 9:30pm and my passenger side door swung open while on the entrance ramp to highway 24. My infant was sitting in that passenger side in her carseat and thankfully she wasnt injured. A car could have collided with that door or it could have hit anything outside resulting in extreme damage, injury, or death. Upon inspection of the door latch, the door latch is almost completely unhinged. The screw cam off, and the latch simply swivels and does not lock the door or hold it in place. We had to drive home with our hand physically holding the door closed. My driver side door also seems to not be fully latching - though it is not in as bad condition. But upon driving it, you can feel an airgap with the sound at higher speeds which suggests to me that this door latch is also at extreme risk of failure. These two doors are the only ones commonly used by us. But given they are both seemingly failing, my guess is that all four door latches are defective and at immediate risk of causing harm, injury, or death to those Cybertrucks on the road with the same latch.*

>Consumer Location HORSEHEADS, NY
>**Summary of Complaint**
>*Received a “critical error” message on the screen and was advised to pull over. After doing so and putting the vehicle in “park” I was unable to take the vehicle out of park or move it at all. This would have been very dangerous if it occurred in an unsafe neighborhood or busy highway. Couldn’t even take it out of park for the tow truck driver to get it onto the flatbed so he had to use “skates” to pull it onto the truck. There were many different error messages appearing on the screen related to different systems in the car so I suspect some sort of electrical defect caused multiple systems to fail simultaneously. I uploaded a couple of pics of some of the messages below.*

2. It is fiscally beneficial to undermine American manufacturing to eventually go “see? We just cannot compete with the other countries when our manufacturing can’t even produce a good truck.” And now we’re sending all our manufacturing overseas to line the pockets of those who no longer have to pay a living wage to get their shit made.

"The Cybertruck will fail it’s only a matter of time.And it will get canceled, just like the first roadster. 

There has only been one Cybertruck that possibly wouldn’t have all these issues and that was the prototype.

Even on that one the glass broke. The rest of these are cheap generic knock offs of the original.

I’m not 100% certain, but the prototype possibly had better parts, components and manufacturing and they only had to build that one. 

Leon said building 1 is easy, building them in mass is hard. So that gives you the idea these things are not only POS to build, but also to maintain.

If you look at the parts and manufacturing it’s cheap garbage. The parts look like they were made in China, that’s probably an insult to China. BYD actually makes good products.

I don’t know how long Tesla can keep this up but unless they are making tons of money on each one (which I doubt) the recalls, and ridiculous depreciation would kill this thing unless it’s just pure Fanboyism.

What an awful POS vehicle though. 

This really already failed, but only the people with their eyes open see that. Spending $120k on a broken product is an abject failure by any measure.

Musk didn't create this vehicle for earth he created for it our future on Mars. 

Gravity on Mars is slightly over 1/3 that of the earth and guess what, the toothpick thin suspension components are more than strong enough to hold up the cybertruck when it weighs 2/3 less...genius

It also doesn't rain on Mars, so no software crashes, no wet truck beds and no leaks coming through the giant oversized glass windshield/roof...genius

Lastly thanks to all those stainless steel panels the owners, who we would all be happy to see sent to Mars, now have easily accessible shovels and axes and tent poles and walls. They just need to gently tug on the body panels to pull them off and they can start building a colony...genius

"Buy a CuckTruck, Get Cucked by the Universe. When purchasing a CuckTruck the first you’ll be greeted is your CuckTruck looking all dirty with it not being cleaned up and looking brand new with the cost of $100k. 

Second, when you show up at home your wife will be looking disappointed when you could’ve put a down payment on a beautiful new house. She will be questioning every purchase you make from now on. 

Then 2 days later after shelling out $500 for a new charging station after installation fees and taxes you come to your new CuckTruck and it’s bricked. You called Tesla and wait on hold for 4 hours as Tesla doesn’t want to deal with you. 6 hours later, after you could’ve been at work you arrived at the Tesla dealership where they tell you, you have to wait 4-6 weeks for it to be repaired. 

8 weeks has passed and you went on to Twitter to beg Elon to fix your truck and state many times over in your tweets that you love the truck. Elon doesn’t reply to you. And 2 weeks after your CuckTruck is ready to be picked up, thinking Elon has heard you. 

On the way home from Tesla, you accidentally hit a pothole filled with water from last night’s heavy rain storm and the red screen of death appears. And you have no choice to wait another 2 hours on hold with Tesla. 

Another 2 weeks goes by and you got your CuckTruck back. However, Tesla states that you will have to pay for the repairs due to it not being covered by the warranty. You get home and get berated by your wife that she hates the CuckTruck and doesn’t want to see it anymore. You beg and plead with her at your love for this “truck”. She gives you an ultimatum, “It’s me or the CuckTruck!”

Begrudgingly, you post it on FB Marketplace at $100k and it’s just people asking questions about your decisions in life. A month goes by, you drop the price by $5000 stating you know what you got and no low ball offers. 

Weeks goes by and still no buyers, so you stick a for sale sign on the back of your CuckTruck hoping for some to buy it as you keep taking it for joyrides. Still nothing. Your wife gets more frustrated that you cannot sell the vehicle that you’ve noticed your wife has changed in front of you. 

You take it off FB Marketplace and put it on Turo for others to love your pride and joy of a vehicle. It goes off wonderfully and others enjoy it that people are renting it out every weekend and the CuckTruck is your commuting car. Then 2 months later the unthinkable has happened, your pride and joy CuckTruck was in an accident due to the guy on Turo had a few too many drinks and crashed it into a ditch, the indestructible truck got damaged and you demand it to be repaired through insurance but the driver insisted that he will pay for it in cash on a bi-weekly basis. You’re thrilled and excited you shake his hand. He gives you his contact information and email address and he sets off for you to set up the contract. Later that night, you send it and it comes back as an invalid email. You call the number he gave you and it’s the local Hooters restaurant. You tell your wife about it and she becomes apathetic towards you. 

Determined to pay off the damages you post again on to FB Marketplace this time to pull trailers and haul loads for people doing DIY projects because you have a truck and it can do truck stuff. But you quickly realize that it cannot tow anything nor put heavy objects in the vault due to severe battery loss and the tailgate is now warped. You don’t want to wait 1.5 hours everyday and pay $75 to use a supercharger. You even come home to your wife and she loaded her recent shopping at Costco in her Honda Fit and it used up the same space as the bed of the CuckTruck. When you asked her, “Why didn’t you call me?” She just rolled her eyes and said, “That thing is useless.” And told you you’re sleeping on the couch from now on. 

Defeated, you put it up on FB Marketplace $15k below what you paid for it. Still no buyers, you blame all the CuckTruck YouTubers, Twitter and r/CyberStuck for all your problems except Elon Musk. 

Then one day, you find that your tires are worn out just after 6000 miles of usage and need to be replaced. But you’re broke, you up to your wife’s room just to find her “spread eagle” by your next door neighbour who owns a real truck. They don’t stop with you staring at them and just keep going like you’re not there. You quietly close the door behind you and sob in the love of your life, your CuckTruck. You speed off to get away from it all. Speeding up to a T-intersection and as you approach it, you realize the gas pedal is stuck to the floor. Before you can get control of the CuckTruck by stomping on the brake and gas pedals you collide on to an embankment at 88 MPH. 

You wake up and realize it was all just a dream and you just fell asleep after cancelling your preorder in your brand new Vinfast.

I am hoping to sell but I know it will be tricky since I still owe money on it and last I heard they don’t retain value as well as they used to. Is this still true?

If I were to attempt to get another car would I need to get a loan that covers what I still owe plus the value of whatever car I end up choosing?

For those of you that have already jumped ship, what did you land on? If I’m being honest I’m leaning away from electric and potential choosing a Prius. I want to say I’d go electric but the only reason I went Tesla was for the supercharger network? How are the charging networks for non teslas?

If you look at the body damage there is a slight scratch on the paint in the middle. The body is slightly dented. I took this to my regular body shop who does our Mercedes cars and he said give or take about a 1,000 Euros. But he could not do the work because he is not an official Tesla place and hence cannot do the work, or will not do the work. He also indicated only get it done in a Tesla shop because of the warranty.

So I asked for two quotes and the answer was 2,380 Euros and 2,550 CHF. Are you fracken kidding me? We always fix our own little dents because our deductible is about 750 Euros. In most cases we are always below 1,500 Euros. My wifes Mercedes GLA who had a torn fender that needed replacing cost 1,350ish CHF. And that was done by Mercedes Switzerland, not exactly a cheap haven.

I said to my wife, nope never again a Tesla. She agreed because those are outrageous prices and if we have to go via the insurance our already expensive insurance will continue to go through the roof. As she said I will drive around with a dented car until the battery completely dies.

And the polestar 2 is really cramped inside. Then there's the issue of the polestar 2 is really heavy and can't get 300 miles of range. It's so annoying that all the legacy auto makers are copying Tesla for interior design. Oddly enough there's plenty of gas cars out there that still have tons of buttons.

But the golden carrot he put in front of investors faces regarding a bright Tesla future is just bullshit and only serves for Musks well payed exit, if Trump wins. Then he can easily argue, that he has to leave Tesla because duty calls in the government and he never actually has to deliver. So OTM call (280) till/after Trumps win and after that put options once he announces, that he works for Trump now.

First things first, margin improvement, free cash flow and improved cost of production is very impressive and shows that the core business is doing well.

Nevertheless, this does not correlate anyhow with the stock price. So lets talk the golden future laied out in the earnings call.

* There is no way the HW3 will be able to be used as a robotaxi, he finally said that.
* They are already testing ride hailing/robotaxis with drivers --> whats the news here?! Its like any other Tesla with FSD where a driver is sitting behind the wheele.
* How the f\* does he project 20-30% growth in 2025:
   * All factories are close to max. capacity. Mexico factory is on hold, Shanghai might start soon. BUT: The economy in china is f\*. Tensions with Taiwan are rising and could escalate.
   * US sales are down.
   * The economy and EV business in Europe is struggling.
   * The 25k vehicle is canceled --> no growth here.
   * The Cybertruck is a niche product for the US.
   * There are no details regarding the affordable models. If actually starting in Q1 2025 those can only be stripped down existing models. I really doubt that people will go for those cars.
* No news on licences for robotaxis:
   * It is extremely risky to bet on the no stearingwheel/only camera approach. Everybody else uses multiple sensors and still faces situation they cant handle, especially not legally if shit hits the fan.
   * The legal issue regarding robotaxis is not solved and not in Teslas hands to solve.
   * Volume production for Robotaxis in 2026 might sound nice but as stated before, you don't know if Tesla is actually allowed to deploy them.

All those points combined with fact, that he even managed to give multiple contradicting statements during the earnings call leave me with following conclusion:

Due to the financial mess he is in with his Twitter purchase and all those unachievable promises he prepares his golden exit. He wants to push the stock as high as possible before the Trump election and will then leave since the government will call and he is destined to serve America. This way he can solve his financial mess with Twitter while saving his face. So long till the election and short after that.",10-24-2024,negative

"Long Term Reliability I've been driving a 2008 Honda Civic for probably the last 7 years, car had 95k miles when I bought it and now has 245k miles with almost zero maintenance other than routine stuff. I've recently gotten more established in my career and am in a position to upgrade since the Civic is starting to really show its age now. 

  I've considered Accord hybrids and a few others but recently started looking at Teslas because I really like the looks of the 2024 refresh (model 3). Me and the wife went and test drove one at Tesla of Knoxville Saturday and I was blown away. The interior and acceleration are insane in my eyes coming from a 2008 Civic the Tesla seems like a spaceship. 

  My only major concern is long term reliability, I'm wanting to buy new so I'll be covered by the warranty for as long as possible. It's a bit alarming though how many post I see about stuff as simple as door gasket material messing up on cars that aren't even 3 years old yet and all these model 3s that are having issues with less than 100k miles. 

  Pretty much my question is I wanna hear from the people that have had little to no issues, if you have 100k+ mile and have had no problems I'd like the hear about your experience. Also one more thing what's up with all the 2021s that are having battery issues, are the battery's in the 2021s different from other years or is the same kind of battery used in the 2024s. Crazy how many HV packs have been failing on the 2021s with low low miles.

It seems to confirm the idea that all of Elon's activities are in search of and support of SpaceX, but also that the approach behind Robotaxi and SpaceX has virtues and is potentially very smart. Though it attempts to cover the positive points of Tesla's choices fairly, I think it inadvertently makes a strong case for booting Elon. 

On the other hand, the article finally explains to me at least, why his board may be enamored enough of him to keep him on.

The money paragraph: ""The Tesla bet, though, is that Waymo’s approach ultimately doesn’t scale and isn’t generalizable to true Level 5, while starting with the dream — true autonomy — leads Tesla down a better path of relying on nothing but AI, fueled by data and fine-tuning that you can only do if you already have millions of cars on the road. That is the connection to SpaceX and what happened this weekend: if you start with the dream, then understand the cost structure necessary to achieve that dream, you force yourself down the only path possible, forgoing easier solutions that don’t scale for fantastical ones that do.""",10-15-2024,positive

"My Model Y is stressful to drive.Did a 90 mi round trip drive yesterday, I had four phantom breaking events, one with a guy right behind me. On top of that I had two warnings to take control immediately, complete with blaring alarms, and both times with my hands literally on the steering wheel. 
This was in just TACC because I find FSD just a white hot mess.  Everytime I think I can relax a little, an alarm goes off or the brakes slam on.  Not what I was promised, and not something you experience in a demo drive either.  It's only when living with it day to day the negatives really shine through.

I'm asking Tesla about a return, but barring that I'll likely sell at a loss soon and go back to an old-fashioned car with regular cruise control and limited safety systems.  I'm about 3 weeks into ownership and so far 100% of the stressors have been safety system related.  The EV portion of the Model Y is simply amazing, great efficiency and incredible power delivery. It's the safety inclusions that make it stressful to drive, the irony.

I had a Chevy Bolt for 4 years so EV driving is not new to me, but the Bolt had none of these safety or driver assist annoyances, it allowed me to simply drive it.
I just get the impression that the Model Y doesn't seem to want me to drive it, like it just wants to stay plugged into a charger and never move.

Why low profile tires? Its a taxi not a sports car ffs, why would you want to feel every lump in the road?

Why butterfly doors? Good luck getting out in a tight spot or an area with low clearance.

Why are the seats so low to the ground and why is the roof so low? Anyone who has gotten into and out of sedans and SUVs/vans knows exactly how much easier the latter is on the back and joints.

This feels to me like a clever joke, El\*n M\*sk was like, ok how do we make this as bad as possible, just to mess with everybody and he's laughing the whole ride home.

The Model Y would make a better robotaxi because it has more seating, seats at a nice height, roof at a nice height, and higher profile tires for a softer ride.

Its funny that Waymo, which makes robotaxis which actually function, just uses Jaguars and Hyundais and doesn't worry about designing their own car.",10-12-2024,negative

Tesla needed to do five things on Thursday: show a robotaxi, discuss entry to service, discuss safety data, provide details of its business model, and offer an Easter Egg. Tesla hit three of those five.

As for the three it hit, there wasn't much any discussion about how Tesla would enter service or details about what regulatory hurdles the company faces and how it plans to overcome them. For the two that Tesla missed, the lack of any new safety or driving data was glaring.""",10-11-2024,negative

"Review: 6 Weeks in a Tesla - WTF?!I'll preface this by saying I've never been the type to seek out reddit pages to rant, but my recent experience has turned me into one of those people. I was never an ""Anti-Tesa"" person. My opinional disagreements stem from my personal belief that hybrids are the realistic future unless this country embraces nuclear energy. I would enjoy trolling the type of Tesla owner that acts obnoxious that they are single handedly saving mankind with their Tesla but don't have an answer when you ask them where electricity comes from. 

I had been in a couple different Teslas previously but I just finished a 6 week extended rental of a 23 Model 3 while my car was in the body shop. I don't think I can encounter anything in my life that was so incredibly hyped and turned out so incredibly horrible. 

Now, I'll admit, I was in a rental (likely) base level Model 3 long range, so I'm willing to admit that my experience might have been slightly more positive in a higher end model. That being said, I am now convinced more than ever that the Tesla enthusiasts that obnoxious talk up these cars so much are nothing but rabid fan boys that are completely blind to what a piece of crap this car is. 

Despite being their ""lower"" model car, the MSRP on model I had (when new) started around 40k+. I've seen used models of the exact  i had with the same mileage (16k) for about 30k+. What I experience for a car of that price blew my mind! 

First, when I picked up the car, the drivers door made a loud pop noise when opening in. Fearing the car they gave me must have been in an accident, I asked for a different car. They showed me 2 others that made a similar sound. The rental manager informed me that most of the Tesla they've had make that noise and it was just a ""Tesla thing"". 
Onto the famous Tesla build quality. The cheap plastic panels that creek with the slightest touch. The horrible faux pleather seats and wheel. I personally hate the ipad knock off UI that you have to use for EVERYTHING, but I'll admit that is a personal preference and give that a pass. The sounds this car made with every slightest bump in the road made me feel like I was driving a 2000 Mitsu Mirage. 

While the car has some very unique and (formally) ahead of its time features that I found to be completely novelty and largely useless. (Disco lights and romance mode? Seriously?). After my extended test drive I firmly believe that the fan boys point to these unique gimmicks to cover the fact that a 40k car doesn't have many super basic features you'll find on base model Hyundai's, Hondas, or any other brand.  

First, refusing to integrate Car Play and Android auto in laughable. Its like driving a car from early 2000 when bluetooth audio was a technological gift from God lol. The built in navigation (like the rest of the car) is atrocious. No ventilated seats. Oh a glass roof, that's kind of cool, but it doesnt open lmao. The road noise was something I haven't experience on any car in the last decade. The loud whistling coming from the windows has me constantly checking that the windows were rolled up. They were, of course. I suppose windows that don't seal is part of their fresh air feature. 

I see ""Full self driving"" and think okay, this should be cool. Here is that awesome technological I've heard about. I almost pissed myself laughing when I realized it's nothing more than adaptive cruise control, which I had standard on my 2016 Civic and is not only standard, but far superior only my current 22 Honda and my wife's 22 Hyundai (not to mention insanely significantly better build quality, interior and interior materials).  Outside of engaging ""full self driving"" which seemed to mandate cruise control, the car doesn't even have active lane keep assist!🤯 Which is not only standard on my Honda and Wife's Hyndai, it works SIGNIFICANTLY better than teslas full self driving. I start to veer out of my lane and my Honda/Hyundai automatically pulls me back into place. Not to mention the active lane keep assist works at any speed and isnt something that requires cruise control at high way speeda. When adaptive cruise control is on, the car continues to steer itself, accurately, through some very strong curves and bends in the road. This Teslas FSD would disengage at the slightest bend in the road. 

I could go on and on but I've wasted enough of my time on this, frankly, really shitty car lol. 40k+ for that car is absolutely laughable. 

If electric cars are your thing, that's great. But in 2024, every single major car company has Electric cars/SUVs that are infinitely better than these overhyped cheap pieces of junk Elon is making. 

I'm trying to be objective in my review because I really didn't have any prior prejudice against Tesla prior to this 6 week rental. Maybe other than I tend to find a disproportionate amount of Tesla owners I've met to have this douchey arrogance but, to be fair, you can find that anywhere. 
So, what am I missing? Why does this company have such a large cult-like following of enthusiasts? Because what I just drove for 1.5 months was a complete POS and the entire time I wish I had taken the new Elantra or Altima they had but I wanted to see what the hype was about.

"Buys a car and complains about negative equityI just read a post where the OP was complaining about negative equity, and from the discussions, it seems like Tesla buyers often view their cars as *something special that holds a higher value than others*.

At the end of the day, a car is just a car—it will depreciate over time due to various factors (poor quality, brand reputation, company values, etc.). So, are you buying a Tesla because you believe it *holds higher value over time?*

PS. I’m aware of the price cuts",09-15-2024,negative
"The Worst Decision of My LifeI bought a Model 3 because I liked the design. It was a status symbol at the time and I thought I wanted that. I bought a MMEGT and loved it but felt that owning a Tesla was cool and tech was supposedly light years ahead. My experience was immediately jarring. The seat took about two months to get used to because they couldn’t be bothered to ergonomically design it. So I finally got used to it. Great. Then I get that wet as- and feet smell. Oh yeah that’s the nightmare to reach cabin air filter. Every other car a glove box simple fix requires to disassemble the center console!! FML. Okay no sweat it’s life. Then EM reveals his true colors just batshit crap human being. Everything financially supports crap I despise. I said okay let me get past that. Bam massive price cuts drowning me in instant negative equity. I said okay Supercharger network is okay. Hey everyone gets access. Okay no sweat. Wait I can’t get an ECU upgrade even though Tesla intentionally hamstrung half their cars to be pinned to SC network? Wow. Okay no worries I’ll charge at home, bam car refuses to charge in garage cause it’s too hot. Which due to global warming is every darn month here in Texas. Today drove past two separate charging stations to be at zero percent. Just done. Venting cause I feel exhausted. ",09-14-2024,negative
"I Just Remembered When Tesla Rep Lied About Battery Warranty After my first test drive I asked about how batteries are replaced.

The rep said they just take bad cells out and put back in good ones.

As if it's hotswappable on the spot.

"NYT article highlights a $22,445.72 hotel payment paid by Musk's security staff.I was reading the recent article on Musk's security apparatus via the NYT and came across something very strange.

It was a segment where they said his security guys sometimes did errands for him, including paying a $22,445.72 hotel bill on his behalf for family and staff in 2016. 

This I find very weird, because firstly its a very high hotel bill. But also why is he entrusting his security staff with such a big payment?

But also, the bill was for **Musk's family and staff's accommodation at a luxury hotel.**

Now either, Musk is personally paying out for his staff's accommodation luxury accommodation which I find unlikely.   
  
Or Tesla shareholders are paying for Musk, his staff and his family to live it up in Hong Kong in a luxury hotel.  
  
What am I missing here?

The article also says his own security company foundation security is a ""clearing house"" for security payments. What payments exactly - luxury hotels??????? tbf, the company was founded after the stay in the luxury hotel.",09-13-2024,negative
