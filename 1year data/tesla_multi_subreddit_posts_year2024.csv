"$RIVN: Riding to ValhallaAlright, degenerates. Rivian isn‚Äôt just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs the ex-nerd who‚Äôs going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you‚Äôre willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla‚Äôs Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon‚Äôs gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they‚Äôre turning the corner to RIVN, who‚Äôs out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla‚Äôs stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian‚Äôs already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump‚Äôs EV Rollercoaster**

You‚Äôd think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here‚Äôs the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies. With Rivian‚Äôs production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian‚Äôs set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone‚Äôs FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That‚Äôll Make You Feel Things** 

Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian‚Äôs R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it‚Äôs the hot-but-affordable option that‚Äôs ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger network? That‚Äôs not just sexy‚Äîthat‚Äôs full-blown EV porn. This isn‚Äôt a one-night stand; Rivian‚Äôs building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn‚Äôt inclusive enough for you Wendy‚Äôs employees, they‚Äôre adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian‚Äôs been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they‚Äôve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they‚Äôve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That‚Äôs efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They‚Äôre hyped about Rivian‚Äôs leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they‚Äôre now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company‚Äôs market cap isn‚Äôt going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they‚Äôre only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian‚Äôs diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW‚Äôs cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian‚Äôs like the guy spending money he doesn‚Äôt have to impress his date. Sure, it‚Äôs a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it‚Äôs a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he‚Äôs going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that‚Äôs all he talks about? Hell no, he‚Äôll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn‚Äôt just another EV play‚Äîit‚Äôs *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian‚Äôs lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock‚Äôs the real deal, and I‚Äôm strapping in for the ride.

"(50k YOLO) The Walmart Tariff GambitPositions:
80 87.5C 8/15/2025 @ 6.58 avg (~52k)

DD:

TLDR; Walmart is poised to easily gain +20-30% over the next year. In conjunction with incredibly cheap LEAPs (20% IV) this means the potential for two caniac combos worth of tendies. 

The Overview 
Walmart has seen almost a 30% gain since last earnings as investors are piling in on the presumption that increased automation and E-Commerce will improve top and bottom lines. What is less talked about right now is the effect the Trump administration will have on Walmart and its domestic competitors. Walmart sources almost 2/3s of its products domestically in the US. In fact, Walmart has direct relationships with US suppliers and manufacturers‚Äî this has been a core part of their business model in limiting costs (and food prices, as we will get to). Walmarts competitors, however, mostly source abroad: Target for example has almost 49% of its supplying factories based in China alone. Yea, that‚Äôs right‚Äî the same China Trump wants to slap massive import tariffs on. So what happens when Walmarts competitors raise prices? Well, there‚Äôs a couple options (all of which are either favorable or neutral to Walmart). Either A) Competitors raise prices; Walmart does not on its domestic products and they subsequently capture a much larger market share as consumers flock to cheap Walmart name brand goods (tendies) B) Competitors raise prices and Walmart uses it as an excuse to raise prices as well; profit margins go up while market share stays approximately the same (tendies) or C) this analysis is wrong and Walmart is hit just as hard as its competitors; the automation, E-Commerce platforms, and foreign markets Walmart is attempting to get market share in (and the market is obsessed with) continue to bear fruit, and we are left either up or approximately the same (kids meal tendies). This is in conjunction with the fact that Walmart has reported that consumers from all income strata have already begun switching to Walmart items from competitor‚Äôs stores (read, brand loyalty is in the gutter) making any price discrepancies between Walmart and its competitors have a magnified effect on consumer demand. 

Execution:
But why the hell would I yolo in Walmart which might only go up 20-30% if you are right instead of other, juicier stocks that could move more? It‚Äôs because the relative stability of Walmart‚Äôs stock over the past several years works massively in our favor. 7 month ATM LEAPS are priced with 20% IV in mind (+10% break even), or roughly 6.50 per option. You regards spend more time value premium on a Tesla monthly call than a year long Walmart one. This means we can eliminate much of the risk of this DD (timing the market) and exaggerate the gains from that ‚Äúsmall‚Äù 20-30% move. We are talking a 3-4x of your investment from a -mostly- theta safe investment. And remember, that‚Äôs from at the money LEAPS. This is what makes this investment choice such a juicy opportunity for us.",11-18-2024
"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise valueHello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end.¬†I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here‚Äôs something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right‚Ä¶?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I‚Äôm not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o‚Äô business¬† segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir‚Äôs stock is.

For starters, let‚Äôs take into consideration palantir‚Äôs enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir‚Äôs enterprise value has ballooned much more.

https://preview.redd.it/6povwnwzcn1e1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ebbefc794996c48be08cbb0144c0ee9d675cd

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19*¬†

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this.¬†

But consider this. In their last ‚Äúblowout‚Äù quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate.¬†

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir‚Äôs revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy‚Äôs (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*‚ÄúAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency. You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?‚Äù*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It‚Äôs not just about justifying the current stock price, it‚Äôs about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time.¬†

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It‚Äôs a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*.¬†

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it‚Äôs an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end.¬†

As it stands now, *all* of palantir‚Äôs equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is.¬†

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!*¬†

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that‚Äôs what makes a market.

Happy investing!",11-18-2024

"Trump Team Eyes Rule Overhaul for Self-Driving Regulations, Potential Catalyst to Boost Tesla's Subscription RevenueThe Trump transition team is prioritizing the development of a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles, aiming to revise current regulations that limit the deployment of autonomous cars without human controls. This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump‚Äôs ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk‚Äôs announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

"Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created.

  
Edit: Hundreds of ya all only read point 7 and started refuting how Tesla has factories in China and Germany, so there aren't tariffs, clear skies, etc. Look, when this trade war starts, these countries will want blood. Tesla is not only the US hallmark of EVs, but its flamboyant boss is now part of the US administration that initiated the sanctions.

"South Korea's ""Value Up"" program, and why Korean stocks will boom over the next decade.Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs.

The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value.

Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. **The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock**. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. 

In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes.

There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples:

- SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings.

- Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x.

- Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap.

When you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term.

"Will TSLA still skyrocket?I have been reminding people not to chase the rally for the past two days, and I don't think Tesla will see another 10% daily rally next.

Institutions have finished building up their positions over the past two days, and the retail investors who chased the rally are starting to take profits, and those who didn't make any money are stopping their losses and leaving the market. The only people willing to buy at this price level right now are value investors, but they're not going to get out at this price. So Tesla shares will shake out slightly ahead of Q4 earnings, and there will be no more big rallies or declines.

The short-term risk is high, and in the long term, a better strategy is to buy at a low price and wait patiently for value to return, like Warren Buffett",11-12-2024
"TSM play off NVDA earningsI got roughly 5k people mad saying that Tesla was sooo overpriced, and look at it today it‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôs going to rebound but I‚Äôm going to hold my puts for shits.

"My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200. For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year‚Äôs OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system‚Äôs electro-mechanical design with the OCP community ‚Äî including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink‚Ñ¢ cable cartridge volumetrics‚Äîto support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda).

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter.

"TSLA Potential Bearish Next WeekNext week look at potential bearish TSLA crash

Tesla‚Äôs recent price action suggest a possibility of a pullback, potentially to the $307 level, before moving up to the $335 range. Analysts have noted that Tesla‚Äôs RSI is over 80, placing it in an ‚Äúoverbought‚Äù category, which often leads to a temporary pullback as investors take profits. Additionally, technical indicators show that the stock may face resistance near $335, suggesting it may first need to ‚Äúcool off‚Äù with a slight dip before any attempt at higher levels.

If Tesla does pull back to around $307, it could serve as a consolidation phase, allowing the stock to gather momentum for a push upward. However, this movement is contingent on overall market conditions and investor sentiment staying supportive. Some sources view this pullback as a healthy correction within Tesla‚Äôs ongoing uptrend, while others suggest that breaking below $307 could trigger further declines.

In summary, a pullback to around $307 is likely, but it should be monitored closely, as further decline would indicate potential support level testing around $288. 

While it‚Äôs difficult to predict Tesla‚Äôs exact movements over the next week, there is some consensus among analysts that the stock could face further volatility.

The price is currently above $320, with analysts having varying opinions about where it could go in the near future. Some predict a potential pullback to the $220‚Äì$250 range, particularly considering concerns about profitability and broader market conditions. Other more optimistic forecasts suggest that Tesla could eventually see a rebound, with some price targets as high as $350, but this would be contingent on Tesla maintaining strong market position and positive news, such as advancements in their self-driving tech.

Given these mixed views, while a pullback to around $230‚Äì$240 is possible, it is equally plausible that the stock might stabilize around the $300 mark or rise, depending on the broader market trends and company performance.

Market hype is dying down after this past week, people are taking out profits and we are looking at a big potential dip in the stock. Overvaluation and Tesla having a bad year so far if we talk sales and production; the uptrend is most likely over and if you haven‚Äôt already this could be a good time to sell. The risk is way too high for minimal profit margins.

(It all depends on how much Elon Musk will post on Twitter/X lol)

"Hear me out, hear me out (TSLA)So Elmo was on a call today with The Donald and Zelensky. ü•≠ may have been negative in the past about EVs, but Elon has to have a deal in place - most likely to tariff international EVs so that Tesla wins bigly. But, we all know this. Tesla smashed it this week. Am I pissed I missed it? Yes. Am I looking inwards for losing 30% this week, when the market rallied and a young degen chimpanzee could‚Äôve made money? Absolutely. Do I think on Monday I will be buying the Tesla top? Absolutely not. 

I think there is another catalyst for Tesla. Fuck the election, fuck the new administration. That‚Äôs yesterday‚Äôs news. I‚Äôm talking Russia. 

We‚Äôve seen Elon and Putin in headlines recently. Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to China. But unlike Sleepy Joe, Trump, a fan of Elon, and seemingly friend of Putin, will not give a shit about this communication. With the prospect of at least a ceasefire, if not all out end, to the war in Ukraine looking likely, I believe this opens up trade with Russia again. But this is where it gets interesting. We have an inside man. Elon is first in the running to reopen business in Russia. He is the business face of this administration, and I believe his targets will be set on the Russian automobile market potential. 

Some stats I have found:
- The Electric Vehicles market in Russia is projected to reach a revenue of US$2,470.0m in 2024.
- The market is expected to experience an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2029) of 18.09%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$5,673.0m by 2029.
- By 2029, it is estimated that unit sales of Electric Vehicles market in Russia will reach 61.94k vehicles.
- In 2024, the volume weighted average price of Electric Vehicles market in Russia is expected to be US$89.9k (Elmo can sell for cheaper)

Feel free to collectively shit all over me in the comments, but can you really say to yourself this is farfetched? I don‚Äôt think so. Elon will do Elon things. This is a PR and economic win for him - be one of the faces associated with ending a war, and be one of the leaders in re-intergating Russia into the global economy.

"70k gain thanks to the Trump Trade no one talked aboutEveryone piling into Tesla, Bitcoin, DJT, etc. and no one ever mentioned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two companies have been orphaned ever since their conservatorship 15+ years ago. During Trump's first presidency he implemented steps to re-privatize the entities and with him back in office the market reacted accordingly. I started building my position in the junior preferreds a little over a year ago.

Should mention that there is still room to run. Most of the junior preferred issues are trading at around 30% of their face value. I only hold the junior preferred shares as the common will most likely get wiped in any recap and release scenario. 

It will be interesting to see who Trump picks as his treasury secretary in the coming weeks. John Paulson is one of the names being floated around - he famously bet against subprime mortgages during the GFC and holds a large amount of Fannie and Freddie junior preferreds.

"ASML: Why I am giving up on the stock (for the short term)ASML is a Netherlands based manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company enjoys a wide moat as currently this is only company which can manufacture equipments to produce latest 3 NM AI chips.

ASML counts TSM, Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel and others as its customers.

However, demand for non AI semiconductor equipment systems has dropped significantly which prompted ASML to give lower guidance for the next quarter.

The stock was savagely beateb down and fell from 800+‚Ç¨ to 610‚Ç¨ at yesterday's closing.

Why I have given him on hope of revival of ASML fortunes in the short term?

Except for high end AI chips, rest of the chip industry is struggling to increase sales revenue and profits. In absence of increase in sales, the demand for new non-AI chip producing equipments will be very slow.

Only a sliver of the semi conductor industry [that includes NVDA] has order book full for next rwo quarters. But that demand may also taper in by mid 2025 as likes of Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc have their data centers and LLMs ready by then.

In absense of new demand for non-AI chips and expected slow down in AI chips, it is unlikely any foundary will place new orders for the ASML equipment [each machine is said to cost between 100 M$-300M$].

Revival in the fortunes of ASML depends on breakthrough in new chip designs which will make it neccessary to spend on new equipments. But that breakthrough may take a year or more [yes, it takes time to discover/invent new technologies & designs with sufficient advantage that merits an upgrade].

ASML stock fell below important psychological resistance of 618 ‚Ç¨ yesterday, while US tech sector roared to new heights. This weakness is fortunes of ASML is telling and may lead to further drop in price in coming days.

While ASML remains a strong company with a wide moat, but in the current cycle of the semi conductor industry it is unlikely to post strong results.

How to trade?

Buy 580 ‚Ç¨ PUTs with December 20th expiry.

Happy Trading!

Lucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.

EDIT: I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING AND HOLDING STOCK NOT OPTIONS. We need more stock holders for the short squeeze front with the low float. Options are at a high premium now after I posted this but the stock is still about the same price.

Feel free to reserve your Lucid Gravity SUV on Nov 7th. That would help tremendously for the stock. Plus 

Edit: MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR STOCKS UNSHORTABLE BY PUTTING THEM ON A HIGH SELL OFFER LIKE $50 OR DISABLING BORROWING.

UPDATE: 
If you bought calls and want to sell them please buy stock. Most of the regards shorted bought stock at $2.20 with 33% shorted. Let's squeeze them out. This stock still has a bunch it can run.",11-05-2024

"Valeo: The Europoor EV Play You're Too Rich to NoticeRead up, I know this is¬†**WallStreet**¬†Bets but while you've been busy losing money on $TSLA calls, there's an actual value play in the europoor EV space that's criminally undervalued: Valeo, the French auto supplier that's about to make your wife's boyfriend jealous.

**TL;DR:**

* Massively undervalued based on fundamentals
* Rising profit margins in coming quarters
* Confirmed strong cash flow
* Already announced debt reduction plan
* Huge R&D investments already made
* Cost reduction strategy in progress
* Short-term üåàüêª manipulating price down based on slight revenue dip and debt.

**üöÄ Short Squeeze Potential**:  
The stock has significant short interest with bears piling in on revenue guidance. But these üåàüêª are about to get caught with their pants down when:

* Margin improvements hit next quarter
* EV transition accelerates
* Cost reduction results start showing
* Debt reduction plan delivers

**Why Your Smooth Brain Should Care:**

1. They're balls deep in EV AND Self-Driving tech when every boomer car manufacturer is trying to catch up to Tesla
2. Stock is getting hammered short term but bottom has been resisting for a while now = perfect entry for patient autists
3. Increasing dividends coming for those who can hold without paper handing

**The Real DD:**  
Short sellers are having a field day with the revenue guidance being slightly down for next year. But here's what these ü§° are missing - Valeo is positioning for the entire auto industry's transition to EV and to add self driving feature. They've already done the hard part with R&D investment while implementing cost-cutting measures. They have a world class AI division (valeo.ai) and provide the best Lidar around.

**Price Action:**  
The stock is getting beaten down harder than your portfolio after a JPow speech. But unlike your options plays, this has actual fundamentals behind it. When the EV transition accelerates, those who diamond handed this will be laughing.

**Position or Ban:**  
Currently holding shares because I actually believe in this play (and I'm too europoor for options).

"Lucid vroom vroomCriticism of Lucid Motors as a company and investment can stem from several factors:

1. **Production Challenges**: Lucid has faced significant delays in ramping up production of its electric vehicles (EVs), which raises concerns about its ability to meet demand and achieve profitability.

2. **High Valuation**: The stock has often been seen as overvalued compared to its revenue and production numbers, leading some investors to view it as a speculative investment rather than a sound long-term pick.

3. **Competition**: The EV market is rapidly growing, with established automakers and new entrants competing fiercely. Lucid faces stiff competition from companies like Tesla, Rivian, and traditional automakers that are expanding their EV offerings.

4. **Financial Stability**: Concerns about cash flow and the company's ability to finance its operations and growth plans can deter investors. If the company struggles to sell vehicles or generate revenue, that could negatively impact its stock performance.

5. **Market Sentiment**: Stock performance can be influenced by broader market trends. If investor sentiment towards EVs or growth stocks shifts, Lucid's stock could be adversely affected.

6. **Management Decisions**: Any perceived mismanagement or lack of strategic vision can lead to a loss of investor confidence. 

Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

BYD Auto (Chinese) revenue eclipses Tesla for first time as EV giants go head to head,10-30-2024
"$F Freaky? Future? Ford.Are you kidding me? Overnight dump and the thing only moves down a dollar? A 2-cent BEAT on EPS and a 10th consecutive revenue beat? Like 250 MILLION SHARES in VOLUME over the last TWO days? Please, this thing is primed for takeoff as soon as the covered call bitches are done.

A few key points:

-First off, and most importantly, Ford is becoming a software company. They have over 12000 software engineers. The potential profit from commercial and governmental fleet management is sky high. They already have 630,000 subscribers at an average of $7-8 dollars a month. That's 60 million dollars a year for just software already, and they're only scratching the surface. And what happens when we need a more popular brand than Tesla for LIDAR and optical mapping for all the self-driving cars and robots working in public? What happens when all service vehicles are ALREADY Fords? No other brand will have the tech or reach, or relationship with the US govt. and companies.

-Ford is SELLING their cars, often even with their own financing (by the way Ford Credit is making BANK). Their leases are so low they don't even bother discussing them, and that is key considering their competition will have lots full of old inventory piling up. Look at their Maverick sales. Look at their LINCOLN sales up 50% YoY. The Nautilus is by far the most well received SUV we've seen all year.

-Ford is expanding remote and mobile service; yet another profit/revenue stream.

-Ford's EVs are only getting better. Have yall seen the Mach E Rally? Thing is a beast and looks good too. The 2025 Mach E will have all US parts and should have an under 30k price tag with the government incentive, making it competitive with even chinese EV pricing IN CHINA. Ford is already shipping Tesla supercharger adapters for their chargers, and collaboration with Tesla should only grow deeper as both companies realize they need eachother for the overall future of US excellence and dominance in the automotive industry.

-The ex-dividend date is coming up on November 7th, and I see 0 chance, as in ain't no way, this thing is going lower. Who wouldn't want 15 cents a share on a stock trading under 11 dollars for the last time in history?

-CEO Jim Farley is late comedian star Chris Farley's cousin, so the boomers, Gen X, and millenials all know what the fuck is up.

TL;DR: This is not just a car company, it's a TECH company. I bought more shares and long dated calls today because FUCK WHOEVER IS SELLING. Honestly, I might get even more tomorrow morning and EAT on that dividend AND profits for the next 20 YEARS as it becomes the best selling brand in the US and worldwide. THIS IS AMERICA MOTHERFUCKER!

"When Skynet Takes Over, I Want a Piece of the Action ($100K Investment Thesis)[Positions as of 10\/28\/2024](https://preview.redd.it/rztd2a5l6lxd1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8fa595bef1b6cb133af2398456283122db2f8c3)

TL;DR: We're entering an unprecedented technological acceleration where AI capabilities are advancing exponentially. Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.

**The Thesis:**

We are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:

**Key Technical Developments:**

* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints
* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities
* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)
* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)

Business Implications:

1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.
2. Follow the Money:
   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually
   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today‚Äôs dollars
   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets
   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment
3. The Economics Are Compelling:
   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue
   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt
   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)

  
**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:

[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)

* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:

[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)

   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% 
   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% 
   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%
   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% 
   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% 
* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:

   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA
   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR
   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:
      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters
* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):
   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout
   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.

  


 **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**

There's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\[1\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\[2\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   
I've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. ",10-29-2024

"TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worthElon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.

On Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.

Much of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.

He predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from ‚Äúfully unsupervised‚Äù Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.

In an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, ‚ÄúI predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.‚Äù

Musk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).

Tesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.

The second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.

* Selected by Rocketlab to provide Antennas and RF hardware.

And those are just some of the latest contracts & advancements Redwire has made. They‚Äôve been prolific aquirers since going public and continue to aggressively expand their footprint across all space sectors.

It‚Äôs why their CEO goes by the Moto of ‚ÄúIf space wins Redwire wins‚Äù, a confident statement backed by their foundational success of becoming the ‚Äúbuilding blocks to space‚Äù

Yet it‚Äôs currently one of the cheapest and most undervalued Space stocks there is. Trading at a P/S of just 1.58 compared to Rocket Labs 11.5. A market cap of just $450m vs Rocketlabs $4.28b & ASTS $6.73b

This isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs better, it‚Äôs about Redwire being drastically undervalued and under the radar of most growth investors.

I shared my thoughts on Rocketlab 3-4 months ago after scooping the October and January calls.

Since then people have finally started to realise the potential in the company. To sit are similar valuations based upon growth and income, Redwire would not to hit approximately $42/share. At this point it would still remain once of the cheapest yet most advanced space companies out there.

Why now?

Stocks move in themes, every success trader from here to Timbuktu will tell you that. It‚Äôs caused by the excitement and willingness of investors to take on risk on what they believe to be innovative and early stage Giants. The recent news of SpaceX, the parabolic run in ASTS and Rocketlabs 50th successful launch, all set the stage for a new theme and fomo rally to emerge.

Just like when EVs moved thanks to the hype in Tesla we saw the entire sector move.

Just like when $AI started the AI run and others such as NVDA (plus plenty of others) took the button and ran for 12-18 months.

I see the Space sector as an emerging theme and names such as Redwire could potentially take the baton and garner worldwide interest.

For me, I see the worst case, bear case, as Redwire being a $1bn+ market cap by Christmas, which still represents a 100% move. Best case I see buyers stepping into calls of which market makers are drastically under-positioned for, creating a substantial over the top rally.

These things are true:


1) Cybertruck is not a failure. Demand is still high.

"$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let‚Äôs crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn‚Äôt even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla‚Äôs Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn‚Äôt tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he‚Äôs in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That‚Äôs triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn‚Äôt, and he‚Äôs letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I‚Äôm betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I‚Äôll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.

Biggest EV car market in China, people there have options but there are so many random ass Chinese EV models doesn't compare to Tesla imo. Eventually Tesla tech value will outshine all those other EV brands when regulators approves FSD in china. 

Just with the tech it's head and shoulder above anything i.e. Rivian was cool but boring now compared to FSD, autonomy, etc.

With used EV car prices declining from YoY, that's a good thing cuz more people will buy EVs which will use the Tesla charging networks, additional revenue for Tesla.

"üöÄ ACHR: The Future of Urban Air Mobility & Why It‚Äôs Leading the Charge üöÄ**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is developing electric flying taxis (eVTOLs) with solid partnerships, including the U.S. Air Force, and aiming for a slice of a $1.5 trillion market by 2040. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited about their tech and the company‚Äôs future.

**1. Game-Changing Tech & Some Pretty Sweet Deals**  
Alright, imagine this: you‚Äôre sick of sitting in traffic, and instead, you hop into a quiet, eco-friendly flying taxi. That‚Äôs what Archer is building, and it‚Äôs not just a pipe dream‚Äîthey‚Äôve got **$142 million in contracts** from the U.S. Air Force. Yeah, the **Air Force** wants their tech. Plus, they‚Äôre expanding to places like the UAE and India. Big markets, big moves.

**U.S. Air Force & ACHR. Yeah, it‚Äôs serious.**

*Processing img qp6pziu3livd1...*

**2. eVTOLs: A Market Ready to Take Off üöÅüí∏**

* This isn‚Äôt just a small niche. We‚Äôre talking **$1.5 trillion** by 2040. That‚Äôs the kind of market size that gets me excited. ACHR is already in the lead, planning to have their flying taxis ready by 2025.
* And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîcities are desperate for greener, faster transport solutions. Archer could be the Tesla of the skies.

**3. Market Skepticism Presents Opportunities**

* Some investors might be underestimating ACHR‚Äôs potential. Short interest is high, which could indicate that there‚Äôs skepticism. But strong partnerships, like the one with the U.S. Air Force, are clear votes of confidence in the technology.
* This is a chance to get in early, while the market is still waking up to ACHR‚Äôs potential. üöÄ

**Check This Out: ACHR vs. Early Tesla**

*Processing img q9fok5c7livd1...*

**4. How ACHR Stacks Up Against Competitors**  
ACHR isn‚Äôt just sitting around‚Äîcompared to other eVTOL companies, they‚Äôre in a solid spot. More contracts, big market potential, and a growing presence.

*Processing img pvzfzv2blivd1...*

**5. Why Now is a Great Time to Watch ACHR**

* **Strategic Growth:** ACHR is actively securing partnerships and expanding its market reach. With contracts like the one with the U.S. Air Force, they‚Äôre proving their tech isn‚Äôt just a concept‚Äîit‚Äôs real, and it‚Äôs happening.
* **Upcoming Developments:** Keep an eye on earnings reports, potential new contracts, and advancements in eVTOL testing. Each of these could be a major catalyst that puts ACHR in the spotlight.
* **Positioning Early:** The eVTOL market is projected to grow massively, and ACHR is positioning itself to lead. Getting in early with innovative companies like this has historically been a winning strategy.

  
**Think of it like this: you‚Äôre getting a ticket to the future of transportation, with a company that‚Äôs already making serious moves.** üöÅ

Tesla Cybertruck Gets Massive Price Cut For Both AWD And Cyberbeast,10-19-2024
"Most nuclear stocks will go the way of EV stocksBack in 2020/2021 tons of new EV companies were being taken public with the promise of becoming the next Tesla. After all, how hard is it to produce EVs profitably? Get a car frame, slap on a battery, program a UI, and you're good to go, right? Wrong. Pretty much every EV stock other than Tesla has shit the bed. They all discovered that manufacturing is hard and lost tons of money in the process. It turns out that it took more than a pile of cash and some promises of greatness to create a profitable EV company. 

Fast forward to today and we have the same thing happening with nuclear stocks, specifically with ones promising to design and build nuclear reactors. OKLO has about $250m in cash with no proven reactors or revenue for years to come, yet it trades at a $2.2B market cap. NNE has about $30m in cash with lots of promises and no revenue for years to come and trades at a $600m market cap. NNE is also being sued for lying in their IPO documents and misrepresenting what they're capable of. How many people here truly understand what it takes to build and run a nuclear plant safely? None, and yet tons are willing to ""invest"" in these companies. Some of you ""long-term investors"" are going to be taken for a ride with some of these companies at these valuations.

Anyway.

Earlier this year $TSLA was going to rock everyone‚Äôs world with the highly anticipated Robotaxi reveal. We see how that went. The event seemed rushed and many important details that investors and Tesla enthusiasts wanted were kept quiet.

Well guess what. The future is still very bright for FSD, ADAS, whatever the fuck you wanna call it. Cars that drive themself.

So,

Mobileye is down 70% this year. Why? Because they‚Äôre headquarters are in Israel for starters. Secondly, they reduced forward guidance on their last quarterly earnings due to the shit show going on in China.

What has happened since then?

Iran and Israel are still in their little weiner match.

China has been throwing out money left and right via stimulus.

"$OKLOYOLO OKLO üöÄ - Why This Stock is Ready to Melt Faces ‚ò¢Ô∏èüåã

Hey all you smooth-brained degenerates, today I'm going deep on a play I think is WAY undervalued and primed to skyrocket: OKLO Inc. ($OKLO). While everyone‚Äôs busy chasing the next meme stock, nuclear power is creeping up as the dark horse to solve our global energy crisis. And Oklo‚Äôs got what it takes to win big in this game.

Why am I so hyped? Because this is the type of stock where if you‚Äôre patient, you could see some major gains as the world shifts toward cleaner, reliable energy. But don‚Äôt just take my word for it‚Äîlet's break down the reasons why Oklo's got serious potential to crush it in the near future. üëá

1. SMRs Are the Future, and Oklo is Positioned to DOMINATE üî•
Everyone‚Äôs talking about solar and wind, but you can‚Äôt scale them fast enough to solve the global power demand, especially in industrialized nations. Nuclear is the only reliable, scalable, carbon-free solution, and small modular reactors (SMRs) are the new frontier. SMRs are safer, faster to deploy, and cheaper to build than traditional large nuclear plants. Oklo is one of the few companies with a fully developed SMR technology that‚Äôs actually on the path to commercialization.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: Oklo isn‚Äôt just developing any run-of-the-mill reactor; they‚Äôve got a next-gen fast reactor that reuses spent nuclear fuel. That‚Äôs right‚ÄîOklo‚Äôs reactors can use waste from other nuclear plants as fuel, which is a HUGE game-changer. They‚Äôre turning a major industry problem into an opportunity, which puts them ahead of other nuclear startups.

2. Regulatory Momentum is On Their Side üìà
Oklo is one of the first companies to receive key licensing approvals from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). They already submitted their first license application back in 2020, and while regulatory hurdles in nuclear are notorious, Oklo‚Äôs head start is critical. The NRC approval process is slow as hell, but Oklo has been grinding it out for years, positioning them to be among the first to bring their product to market once the green light comes. This is first-mover advantage in a sector with MASSIVE growth potential. üí•

And in case you haven‚Äôt been paying attention, governments around the world are finally warming up to nuclear again as they realize you can‚Äôt meet climate goals with renewables alone. Expect to see a TON of government incentives and contracts flowing into this space in the coming years, and Oklo‚Äôs already at the table. üîë

3. Strategic Partnerships & Funding üí∞
A startup can have the best tech in the world, but if they can‚Äôt fund it, they‚Äôre going nowhere. Oklo is already locking down some serious partnerships and investments. They‚Äôve recently secured funding from Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator. Altman‚Äôs investment in Oklo isn‚Äôt just pocket change; it‚Äôs a signal that serious smart money sees the potential here.

Plus, Oklo has partnered with Idaho National Laboratory to utilize their test facilities and advance their reactor designs. They‚Äôve also struck deals with the U.S. Department of Energy to build their first plants on federal land‚Äîwhich is basically like having Uncle Sam as a partner.

4. The TAM is Staggering üöÄ
Global demand for small modular reactors is projected to explode over the next decade. The market size for SMRs could grow to $100 billion by 2030, and Oklo is in prime position to capture a significant chunk of that. Why? Because they‚Äôre not just a concept company anymore‚Äîthey have actual tech and are ahead of most of their competition. As countries look for energy solutions that are green, reliable, and scalable, Oklo is sitting in a sweet spot to capture both government and private sector demand.

5. Insane Upside Potential - This Stock Could Be a Rocket üöÄ
We‚Äôre still early in Oklo‚Äôs journey. The stock is flying under the radar because people are either too scared of nuclear or don‚Äôt realize how game-changing SMRs can be. As more people get clued in to the nuclear renaissance and Oklo moves closer to deploying its reactors, the upside potential is MASSIVE.

Remember when Tesla was trading at a couple hundred bucks and everyone laughed at it? Nuclear is at the same tipping point. As Oklo continues to develop its reactors and builds partnerships, I expect this stock to go sky-high. I‚Äôm thinking $OKLO could be a 10x from here in the long term as they move from concept to deployment.

The Risks (Because I‚Äôm not a total ape) üß†
Regulatory Delays: NRC approvals are slow. Any major roadblocks could push out timelines.
Funding Needs: Oklo will need more capital to scale production, which could lead to dilution if not managed right.
Public Perception of Nuclear: Even though the tech is safe, people are still scared of the word ‚Äúnuclear.‚Äù
TL;DR
Oklo is the dark horse in the clean energy race. They‚Äôve got cutting-edge tech, are ahead of the pack in regulatory approval, and are ready to capture a slice of the $100 billion SMR market. With strategic partnerships, a strong funding base, and growing global demand for sustainable energy, $OKLO is sitting in prime position for a big move.

"IonQ will experience a massive rally and has multiple catalysts on the horizon.**TLDR**; I‚Äôm done doing my due dilligence on IonQ and hold LEAPS that I bought a few months ago during the lows. The price has gone up by 40% since then, and I think this is only the beginning. I expect to see an ASTS-like move within a few weeks to six months for this stock. There are multiple catalysts, primarily technological, as the company produces quantum computing hardware. The technology faces skepticism. I'm not even discussing the SI as I don't care; I‚Äôm focused on the fundamental thesis of IonQ being able to commercialize this technology the fastest, and with superior tech. IonQ has doubled their revenues every year since inception in '21. Went public via SPAC, and is being discounted by Wall Street.

**TL;DR of TL;DR:** $IONQ ATM LEAPS. The company will hold an earnings call next month. Sales are increasing, and they will share their first quantum application. The CEO is good at hyping things in the media and appears to be a great salesman who knows a thing or two about software.

**Why I Think IonQ is Worth a Gamble**

The last time I posted was on September 29th, when IonQ's price was at $8. Since then, the price has increased by 30% to $10.50 today. Some might say, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you share this before it went up?‚Äù Well, I‚Äôll be hearing that every month from now on.

To clarify, my previous post wasn‚Äôt sponsored by IonQ, although I wish it had been. I‚Äôve done my due diligence and am just waiting for the share price to appreciate as we head into 2025.

Quick points on competitive edge: The company has a substantial number of patents stacked up. If you Google a picture of their office, you‚Äôll see a wall full of patents. There‚Äôs significant revenue potential by building a strong base now. IonQ is currently commercializing its technology and claims to have built out a factory that produces these computers in an assembly line manner.

There are multiple short-term use cases for quantum computing. Contrary to popular belief that quantum will only be ""better"" than conventional computing in 20 years, we already see practical applications today. For example, quantum technology is already impacting cryptography.

**Cryptography:** Organizations like the NSA, NIST, and the EU are urging others to transition to post-quantum encryption. Quantum computers can compromise data security across tablets, phones, servers, protocols, and more. The estimated cost of data protection is about 5% of the total value, and the total amount of data doubles every year. While quantum can exploit these vulnerabilities, it can also secure them.

Another critical point is **energy savings** for AI and computing. Forbes recently published an article on how quantum technology could address the energy demand issue for AI, which I found insightful.

My research was primarily from watching company presentations at the Quantum World Congress, earnings calls, and various interviews. Peter Chapman, the CEO of IonQ, previously led the creation of Amazon's 2-day shipping and has been actively discussing quantum machine learning and its applications. He‚Äôs been kind off hyping it up, which is great for the stock. Despite what some skeptics say, this is not all hype, quantum technology is real and is being commercialized now.

I‚Äôd love to dive into more detailed arguments, but that would be a long and potentially boring read. Instead, I recommend checking posts about $IONQ on X from about six months ago, when most of the research began circulating online.

From a technical perspective, I can say that the TTM indicator looks bullish on the 6-day and 8-day charts, showing red dots that signal incoming momentum. The stock had been in a downtrend for a year but has now climbed back to its IPO price.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I‚Äôm done accumulating. My current positions are January 2026 $10 and $15 LEAPS, both bought below 40 deltas and now at 70 for the $10 options and 45 for the $15. I don‚Äôt see the point in risking short-term options, as it would likely lead to wealth destruction. Shares seem like a safer bet for those looking to invest.

Quantum stocks have faced ridicule, being labeled as scams by academics and former insiders who now make a living from YouTube videos and blogs. But to me, this skepticism is reminiscent of people in the 90s saying the internet wouldn‚Äôt take off. From all the quantum stocks I only long IonQ, and avoid the rest.

**Short-term (< 6 months) catalysts:**

* **November 11th Earnings Call:** Expected announcement of the first quantum application running on IonQ's new hardware, which the CEO claims could generate billions in revenue on its own. Still to be proven.
* **Launch of Forte Enterprise:** A data center-ready quantum computer that doesn‚Äôt require ultra-low temperatures. This means it can be placed alongside regular servers without needing a giant freezer for cooling.
* **December 5th, Quantum Basel:** Their European partner will be launching its most powerful system in Switzerland.
* **2025 ‚Äì The Year of Quantum:** The UN, along with smaller partners, will promote quantum computing through media initiatives, highlighting its alignment with sustainable and humanitarian goals. I expect the media narrative to shift from AI to quantum computing, as news outlets look for fresh topics.
* **Prototype Quantum AI Chip:** This development aims to reduce energy consumption, making it more efficient. I remember ARM‚Äôs stock surge when they announced plans for their AI chips, driven by similar excitement.

That‚Äôs it for now. I‚Äôm planning to hold onto my LEAPS until they reach a delta of 1, then switch to shares and ride this investment into 2030, when workloads are expected to shift to NVIDIA GPUs and quantum computing to tackle problems beyond the capabilities of conventional systems, and companies like Oracle, Google, and Tesla are showing interest in this technology.

I know I may sound a bit crazy, but in a few months, I believe I‚Äôll see large returns. It‚Äôs all part of being early, and I enjoy sharing the information I‚Äôve gathered over the past few months.

Tesla is the limping Wildebeast at the edge of the herd, in my opinion. I suspect they've been comitting accounting fraud, have too many non-core projects draining cash, and will need a cash bail-out.

I think Berkshire will buy a large stake, remove Musk, sell off or cancel the AI, FSD, Robotaxi, teslavan, teslatruck obsessions, and develop the affordable car that Elon has been refusing to make. With a steering wheel.

"Robotaxis coming, Robotaxis coming, oh yes Robotaxis still coming!I‚Äôm sure, just like me you all have heard the famous song over past few years, ‚ÄúRobotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming‚Ä¶‚Äù,  song writer and the singer - Elon Musk!

Musk has been playing this song ‚ÄúRobotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming‚Ä¶‚Äù  for nearly a decade promising 'next year, next year'. And, each time, media, dumb analysts and his fans gather to his next concert just as charmed as previous time, only to be disappointed again!

In April, when $TSLA was around $150-$160, Musk announced the Aug. 8 unveiling day of its robotaxi, Again, the hype starts building, analysts start coming up with crazy numbers and stock starts going up, then around last week of July when TSLA rose to around $260, and knowing that there is no robotaxi, Musk panicked and again changed the date to Oct 10. Stock tanks down to about $190 in August and then as Oct 10 approaches, same hype machine starts working, propelling stock to $260 by Oct 1. Finally, Oct 10 came and Elon finally sang the song again ‚ÄúRobotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming in 2026, Robotaxis are coming certainly before 2027‚Äù. And, he showed a 2-seater toy car as future robotaxi! Only, 2% cars sold in US are 2-seaters!! Finally, some analysts are calling the bluff, with Adam Jonas writing ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it‚Äù? 

I wonder why people have been believing this BS for years and spiking TSLA stock each time, when all experts have said that all TSLA has is level 2 driver assistance system, but not FSD as Tesla blatantly continue to lie. You need a combination of LIDAR, Cameras and radars to have level 4 or level 5, fully self driving system while Tesla uses only cameras.

Waymo already operates more than 100,000 paid trips per week through its 700+ driverless robotaxis in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix etc!

"GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. 


. . . . . . .


TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. 



. . . . . 


EDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup 


If (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. 

IMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.


Even this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it.

"TESLA CYBERCAB VS WAYMO : AN ANALYSIS For all the regards who don't know, Waymo is the market leader in true autonomous vehicles right now. They have been operating a fleet of robo taxis (fully autonomous cars) in multiple cities for a while now. 

So I did a short comparison and analysis. 



KEY POINTS FROM ""WE, ROBOT"" EVENT:



1. The robotaxi is a purpose-built autonomous vehicle, lacking a steering wheel or pedals, meaning it will need approval from regulators before going into production.

.
.

2. Tesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 ‚Äî although he said it could be as late as 2027. 

.
.

3. Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.


.
.

4. Cybercab was revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla's ""We, Robot‚Äù event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. 


.
.

5. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn't rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature


.
.

TESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH 



.
.

1. Sensing the World:

 -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.


I. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D ""point cloud"" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.

II. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.
   

III. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.




- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.


I. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.


II. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.


- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).



.
.


2. Understanding the Environment:

I. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.


II.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.


III. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.


IV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.


V. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.


VI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.



- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.



.
.
.

3. Deployment Strategies:

I. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.


II.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.

III.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.



 IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.


V.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.


 VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.


- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.



These are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.



. . . . . .  . 


EDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX 


The entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.

This wasn't a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.

Fast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it's bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.

IMO, He's too busy ""owning the libs"" and fighting cultural wars (""woke virus""). 

Now combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.


FYI, I'm not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it's sad to watch his downfall.


. . . . .


. . . . .

TLDR;


IMO, the event was Very Disappointing. 

Elon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).

It was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.

I expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).


. . . . .



. . . . . 


UPDATE :

. . . . . 

For all the regards who don't understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they're the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.

"Investing and Trading has Evolved. Tell Historians to Suck ItLet's keep this brief potato heads. Go watch some NHL video from 1980. Now watch some NHL video from today. Those idiots in 1980 would absolutely suck today. They'd be too slow and too dumb to play anywhere near the top league today. Same with other sports. 

That's human nature. Through time we improve incrementally. We use the knowledge of prior generations as a base and add to it. So it's no surprise that an NBA player from 1980 would look like Krusty the Clown on a modern NBA team.

Well guess what, same shit has happened in investing & trading. And on an even bigger scale. The stakes are much higher. Instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues, we're talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money. The amount of resources devoted to ""solving"" markets is astronomical.

So now we have a different landscape from your dad's stupid tech company in 1998. Yeah, they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit & tie. Investors were onto something back in the 90's tech bubble though. They realized the trick to investing...

FRONT RUN EVERYTHING

Yeah bitch. Front run fucking everything. Radio on the internet? Fuck it, here's a billion dollars. Pets.com? Sure, you get $500M. Yeah, they took it a little too far in the 90's. But guess what, they were right. The internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich.

The reality was that, you could be wrong on 20 picks so long as you had the 1 Amazon / Microsoft / Apple. Plus, since people weren't front running as much back then, you didn't need to drop 100X Price-Sales on most of these picks (pre-1999). So who the fuck cares if you bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com), your dad's shitty tech startup? So long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts, all mistakes were easily forgiven.

So yeah, today we are thinking ""DAMN, Everything is so Expensive!"" ""AI is a Bubble!"" But guess what, that's just Boomer talk. From now on, everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit. You can forget about getting in at the bottom floor. Once an industry even hints that it will make a splash, some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it. The days where your dumb ass is gonna find Tesla at $10 or NVDA at $50 are long gone buddy.

So thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Stop crying about valuations. The market is just smarter than it used to be. No one's saying THE PRICE IS RIGHT. They just don't give a fuck. Because a single 100X excuses 99 dingleberries.",10-10-2024

"Robotaxis will not be a trillion dollar businessI fail to see the trillions business that Musk and all the analysts parroting for robotaxis.  It‚Äôs a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here‚Äôs my argument:

1. Every single Tesla owner I know won‚Äôt lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.
2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it‚Äôs will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.
3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.

For example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald‚Äôs or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that‚Äôs assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?

Edit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.

Edit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's ""Believe me, it will happen"".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.

Their car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.   This ain‚Äôt about the stock price or where it‚Äôs going.  TsLA never traded on fundamentals anyway.  ",10-05-2024
"Intel stock Short term and long-term pros and consTLDR: Any short term bull run will be up to good news that is difficult to predict. As Intel will likely underperform until their longterm goals pay off I believe the stock will continue to fall unless there is good news like alot of Gaudi3 sales/preorders. Gaudi 3 is lower performance than Nvidias newest ai chip though.

Long term-

Everything Intel is doing are long term investments that will only pay off 2-5 yrs from now. Building fab projected to take 2 yrs, 18A architecture 1 yr to begin production but will require another year for mass production,14A 3 yrs. These projects has high risk of being delayed.

Short term-

On the short term, great news that has yet to happen is Intel showing progress on using their new High NA EUV Lithography machine, improving issues like low output. This machine is more advanced than what TSMC has and is the one lead intel has over TSMC.

The best news possible in the short term for Intel would be TSMC being attacked by China. This would easily lead to Intel tripling in value as TSMC's main operations are landlocked in [Taiwan.Global](http://Taiwan.Global) Guardian experts put the likelihood of an all-out invasion at around 35%. Smaller scale escalations like interupting Taiwans trade will also greatly improve nana's position. Chinese military are already being accused of intentionally ramming into Philippine ships.

Long term potential could be Astronomical if Intel succeeds in their reversal but competitors are also improving. Nvidia's Ai Chips for example are improving at a faster rate than Intel, making them unlikely to catch up in that area. However, their head start on the High NA EUV machine could make it possible to jump the gap against Nvidia. Tesla already thinking of ordering thousands of Nvidia's next gen AI chip set for 2025/26, Intel still has a very strong balance sheet with a large amount of equity, but debt is increasing at an alarming rate and there's rumors intel accounting methods are made to favor their books.

If finalized, the guarantee will support the installation of about 7,500 high-power charging stalls at nearly 1,100 stations, capable of charging two EVs simultaneously.

The funding aims to help EVgo, which currently isn‚Äôt profitable and operates over 3,500 fast-charging stalls, compete with Tesla‚Äôs charger network.

Over 40% of the new 350 kW fast chargers are planned for disadvantaged communities, ideal for individuals without access to private driveways, according to EVgo CEO Badar Khan.

"RoboTaxi Day Will Pay, it just wont be Papa MuskDo I need to link the montage of Elon promising self-driving cars by next year? If you're still glazing that fraud, this post isn't for you, imho betting on Tesla's competitors is the way to make real money on Robo Taxi day. 

Here are the facts: Google's Waymo is far more advanced than Tsla's FSD. Waymo has over 20+ million miles of real-world driving and 20+ billion miles in simulation to Tesla's 0 fucking miles. Google invested in Uber in 2013, so it's no surprise they partnered to embark on their self-driving ambitions. When Tesla fails to deliver, I believe we will see a spike in Uber as the market realizes that Tesla will not be a true competitor in autonomous driving.

Another potential winner of Tesla's RoboTaxi days is Mobileye (MBLY). They used to be a partner of Tesla until they cut their ties with Tesla based on Elon's lies about the current capabilities of Tesla's FSD. MBLY currently has several partnerships with car makers including NIO, BMW, and Volkswagen. 

In 2021, Mobileye announced that the first robotaxi services would be deployed in Munich, Germany. This partnership is still active, with the goal of launching a scalable autonomous ride-hailing service in the coming years. 

Tesla's failure on 10/10 I believe will open the door for the market to realize it isn't at true player in the space and will boost UBER and MBLY. 

I'm still building a position, but I have 10/18 MBLY 15 C
and UBER  10/11 77 C and 10/18 80 C

MBLY also has a very high SI, so if it goes, it will go.

I entered the stock market in Jan 2021. The first stock I bought was CCIV (now lucid) with options and it was the tail end of the spac-mania. Put in about 20k and life was good. I didn‚Äôt know making money was so easy. Waking up and find thousands of dollars in my account. In 1 month, I 4x the money. Surely I can do it again? 

Fast forward, I lost it all. All 80k. No risk management, nothing. 

Took a 6 months break. But I came back, 100% on options. 

This is not addiction. This is dedication. 

Honestly, I can‚Äôt remember what I bought when I returned. I only remember buying Chinese options when HSI (hong Kong index) went back to 1997 level. Gained lots but lost more and I swore to never touch Chinese stock again. But they become relevant again because of the stimulus. (More on that later)

My low point was 7k at the start of 2024 and I managed to 5x it with the AI boom. I‚Äôm fucking sure no one expected the market to recover late last year. AI carried the entire stock market. 

I‚Äôm lucky I was out before the implosion happened on late July - August. I was still down 20% but remember, it‚Äôs 100% options. It could be much worse. 

Right now I‚Äôm 60% in US stocks (30% in Tesla for the robo taxi) and 40% in Chinese stocks. 

What I‚Äôve learnt so far:
-slow money is faster. Fast money is death. 
-price to dream ratio is the best when things are hyped and uncertain. (Hence Tesla and Chinese stock)
- don‚Äôt earn the last dollar. Run when everyone is onboard. (Totally out of AI) 
-never concentrate more than 30% in 1 holding. 
-when you are not certain, Buy/Sell half of the intended position. 
- you only buy more/leverage more if you are in the green. Never the other way around. 


Looking ahead, I positioned more Chinese options. I think this is the moment I‚Äôve been waiting for. I can read Chinese and I find that English DD doesn‚Äôt go into the details of the stimulus. Particularly, 800b yuan swap facilities for collaterals (including stocks which makes even less supply) can ONLY be used to buy stocks. This is their equivalent of QE and their timing is impeccable. (They were waiting for fed to cut rates.) they probably also need the stock market to replace their currently dead real estate market. 

3 Reasons to buy
1. Stocks can be used as collateral and be locked up (supply drops) and the money must go into the stock market. (Demand increase)
2. It‚Äôs mentioned that there could be more rounds of the same size. 
3. They are cheap. Many stocks‚Äôs Forward PE is single digit. Vs high 20s in US. 

3 Reasons not to buy. 
1. It‚Äôs Chinese. 
2. It‚Äôs Chinese. 
3. It‚Äôs Chinese.

https://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255

It might sound crazy, but hear me out‚Äîhere are 8 reasons why I‚Äôm YOLO-ing into NIO right now:

**Fed cutting rates** ‚Äì The Fed‚Äôs already cutting, and they‚Äôre likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don‚Äôt fight the Fed*‚Äîwhen they cut, the market goes up.

**China stimulus** ‚Äì The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index‚Äîstocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won‚Äôt be short because China‚Äôs economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn‚Äôt even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.

**Chinese economy recovery** ‚Äì Like I said, this isn‚Äôt a short-term bull. It‚Äôll probably last a year or two. China‚Äôs economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I‚Äôve seen posts from Chinese forums‚Äîsome people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.

**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** ‚Äì Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you‚Äôll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.

**NIO is even cheaper** ‚Äì NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It‚Äôs been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month‚Äôs price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO‚Äôs sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.

**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** ‚Äì The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it‚Äôs a piece of cake. [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models)

**NIO‚Äôs next two earnings are going to be huge** ‚Äì They just launched a sub-brand called 0nvo, and rumor has it they've already got close to 60k units booked for the 0nvo L60. The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.

**A turning point is coming** ‚Äì If 0nvo‚Äôs sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they‚Äôll scale production and cut costs. They‚Äôre also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That‚Äôs the kind of potential we‚Äôre talking about here.

# Conclusion

In reassessing my recommendations, I have refined the list of companies and ETFs to ensure they represent the most strategic picks for investors considering the potential impacts of Russia's stagflation on global markets.

Russia's stagflation presents a complex landscape for investors, characterized by both risks and opportunities. Sectors such as energy, defense, agriculture, and renewable energy are likely to experience positive impacts due to increased demand, higher commodity prices, and global shifts in energy policy. Companies within these sectors are positioned to capitalize on market gaps and heightened geopolitical tensions.

On the other hand, industries heavily reliant on Russian imports, facing supply chain disruptions, or contending with rising input costs may encounter significant challenges. Aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, and certain technology companies may see reduced profitability and operational difficulties.

For investors, a strategic approach involves focusing on sectors and companies poised for growth amid these global changes. Allocating resources to positively impacted ETFs can offer diversified exposure to these opportunities. However, it's essential to remain vigilant, as the situation is fluid, and geopolitical developments can rapidly influence market dynamics. Continuous monitoring and a willingness to adapt investment strategies are crucial in navigating the complexities arising from Russia's economic conditions.

"Tesla more like DeadslaHello fellow regards and thank you for coming to my Tesla talk. Today I am going to explain the bear case for TSLA in the short term

1. I‚Äôm not a super technical trader/indicator freak, but TSLA is currently near or above overbought territory on every RSI timeframe, including 1mo, 3mo, 1y, and 5y. This can be explained by the hype surrounding delivery numbers, upcoming robotaxi event, and earnings. RSI is not the end all be all for a stock‚Äôs price but it‚Äôs good to note

2. TSLA has been on a tear recently as investors are pricing in good delivery numbers, a successful robotaxi announcement, and good earnings. All it takes is ONE of these events to go poorly and investors will panic

3. ROBOTAXI EVENT - this will probably be the biggest influence in the stock price for the short term, and I don‚Äôt think it will go well. Apart from Tesla‚Äôs history of screwing up announcements (see 6% drop after cybertruck fail), I simply don‚Äôt think Tesla has the technology to compete with Waymo, the main competitor for this type of product. Waymo is backed by google, a HUGE cloud storage provider. This means they‚Äôre able to train their models with more data, more TPU infrastructure, and a better AI team. Tesla, on the other hand, uses a vision-only model that requires a MASSIVE amount of data to be stored in places they don‚Äôt have. This is shown in their latest FSD versions, which experience about 180 miles per critical error. For reference, human drivers experience about 100,000 miles per critical error and Waymo is at 17,000. Unless Tesla is prepared to unleash some magical new tech stack that they‚Äôve been hiding for some reason, I don‚Äôt think they have the tech to release a safe robotaxi to compete with Google. Safety is huge in the driverless car space, because most consumers are already on the fence about being a passenger in one. One misstep in the rollout and TSLA bears would have a field day. I also think that Elon is too full of himself to admit some of these things, so he would happily march out a product that isn‚Äôt ready for the public to use rather than acknowledge Tesla‚Äôs FSD shortcomings

4. Future events - the nice thing about delivery numbers, robotaxi event, and earnings being in a span of a few weeks is that IV shouldn‚Äôt be a huge factor until after everything is all said and done, and you could probably make money buying puts OR calls before the robotaxi event and simply selling the volatility. 

Obviously nobody can predict how earnings will go, but I think one of the main reasons investors give for Tesla‚Äôs ridiculous PE is its market share, advanced technology, and production ability in the EV space. While I still think it has some upside for those reasons, I think other EV companies are chipping away at all 3. You can go on google right now and find open source code that performs nearly as well as Tesla‚Äôs FSD and vision models.

TL;DR - I think there is more downside opportunity than upside with Tesla, and I think bad performance in upcoming numbers and events will tank the stock that has risen 25% in the last month

"Joby Aviation: Flying Cars and Flying Too Close to the SunEver since The Jetsons, people have dreamed of flying cars. Now, thanks to advances in electric motors and battery technology, we're finally on making them real. But the path from science fiction to viable business is rarely straightforward, and the emerging eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) industry faces some interesting challenges.

# The Opportunity

The potential market for eVTOLs is enormous. Morgan Stanley estimates it could reach $1.5 trillion by 2040. That's the kind of number that makes investors' eyes light up. But as any experienced founder knows, a big potential market is just the beginning.

What's exciting about eVTOLs is that they represent a genuinely new category of transportation. They're not just incrementally better helicopters or planes - they're a fundamentally different way of moving people and goods. This creates opportunities not just for the companies building the aircraft, but for an entire ecosystem of supporting businesses: vertiports, air traffic control systems, maintenance services, and so on.

# Market Overview

The eVTOL landscape can be broadly categorized by product, application, and operation. From the simplest helicopter-like configuration to the more advanced tandem tilt-wing architecture, these designs are based on both innovation and market considerations. 

Pivotal's BlackFly, for example, is the first eVTOL aircraft to be both commercially sold and delivered to an individual.

* Its unique tandem wing architecture offers several key advantages including reduced manufacturing cost, fewer potential failure points, and fewer design complications, especially relative to tilting-rotor configurations.
* Its ease of transport and launch-30 minutes to be deployed via 16-foot trailers - and its triple modular redundancy to prevent failure have garnered it interest from the US military as well.
* While its cost of $190,000 is much higher than even a premium car, it does come in at a lower price than certain small aircraft.
* However, as this industry is primarily focused on carrying multiple passengers, the lack of scale and smaller capacity per craft will always limit it's total market share.



# Industry Landscape and Competitive Analysis

Key players in eVTOL market can be categorized as follows:

Pure-play eVTOL companies:

* Joby Aviation
* Lilium
* Archer Aviation
* Volocopter
* Pivotal

Traditional aerospace companies:

* Airbus (CityAirbus)
* Boeing (partnership with Wisk Aero)
* Embraer (Eve Air Mobility)

Automotive and technology companies:

* Hyundai (Supernal)
* Toyota (investment in Joby)
* Intel (investment in Volocopter)

While Pivotal and others have targeted the individual consumer by emphasizing aircraft like the BlackFly, a substantial portion of the industry is concentrating on manufacturing aircraft designed for urban air taxi services, which we'll dive into in the next section One of the most prominent players in this space is Joby Aviation.

# Joby Aviation: A Pioneer Facing Headwinds

Emerged as a frontrunner in the eVTOL race, becoming the first company in the sector to go public in 2021 through a SPAC merger. Initial investor hype propelled its stock to over $14 per share, reflecting some reddit and legit excitement in the nascent industry. The company, founded by JoeBen Bevirt, has spent years developing its eVTOL aircraft, securing partnerships with industry giants like Toyota, and making significant progress toward FAA certification.

However, cracks started appearing in Joby's narrative. The company's early financials were marked by heavy R&D expenditures and substantial operating losses. Moreover, Joby's marketing efforts seemed to outpace its technological development, as seen in costly Super Bowl ad spots while still generating very low revenue. CEO Bevirt's grand pronouncements ‚Äì envisioning Joby as the **""FedEx, Southwest, and Tesla of flight""** appeared detached from the company‚Äôs product focus, raising concerns about a diluted vision and unrealistic expectations. Savvy investors recognizing these warning signs began shorting the stock, further contributing to its decline, trading at $5 per share, which is less than one-third its original valuation, as of 2024.

# Dissecting Financials and Technology

* **Technology**: Joby's eVTOL utilizes a unique tilt-rotor configuration, allowing for vertical take-off and landing while transitioning to efficient forward flight. This design combines the benefits of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, optimizing both maneuverability and speed. The aircraft's electric propulsion system offers environmental advantages, reducing noise and emissions.
* **Funding and Development**: Joby's journey has been marked by substantial funding, including investments from likes of Toyota Motor Corporation and Intel Capital. The company went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger in 2021, raising significant capital to further its development efforts.  However, despite these significant investments, Joby has faced challenges in meeting its initial timelines and achieving profitability, primarily due to high R&D and testing costs. As of 25 September 2024, Joby's market capitalization stands at approximately $3.69B (down from $6.6B - valuation at IPO), reflecting investor uncertainty about the company's long-term prospects.
* **Strategic Partnerships**: Joby has forged key strategic partnerships, including a collaboration with Delta Air Lines to integrate eVTOL services into Delta's existing transportation network. This partnership aims to provide seamless connectivity for passengers, expanding the reach and accessibility of Joby's UAM network. Joby has also partnered with Uber to integrate its air taxi services into Uber‚Äôs ride-hailing platform.
* **Challenges and Opportunities**: Joby faces similar challenges to other eVTOL developers, including regulatory hurdles, infrastructure development, and public acceptance. However, the company's strong financial backing, strategic partnerships, and focus on commercialization position it as a significant player in the evolving UAM market.
* **Market Demand and Performance**: The broader market for urban air mobility is still in its nascent stages, with commercial operations yet to commence on a significant scale. However, the increasing interest from established players like Delta, Uber and Joby, along with rising consumer demand for faster and more convenient transportation options, suggests a substantial growth trajectory for the industry in the coming years.

# Challenges and Lesson Learned:

The eVTOL industry's primary challenges extend beyond the issues faced by individual companies like Joby.  The sector must navigate several key hurdles to achieve widespread adoption and profitability.

* **Regulatory Frameworks:**  Establishing clear and consistent regulations for eVTOL operations, including air traffic management, certification standards, and pilot licensing, is crucial for ensuring safety and fostering investor confidence.
* **Public Acceptance**: Addressing public concerns about noise, safety, and privacy is crucial for gaining the social license to operate and fostering widespread adoption of eVTOL services.
* **Economic Viability**: Achieving profitability for eVTOL operations will require careful management of costs, including aircraft manufacturing, maintenance, and operating expenses.  Pricing strategies must also balance affordability for consumers with the need to generate sufficient returns for investors.
* **The Value of Strategic Partnerships**: Joby's collaboration with Delta and Uber underscores the importance of strategic partnerships in navigating the complexities of a new industry like UAM.  Collaborating with established players can provide access to resources, expertise, and existing customer bases, accelerating market penetration and adoption
* **The Importance of a Realistic Vision**:  Joby's overly ambitious initial vision, attempting to be everything to everyone, highlights the need for a realistic and focused approach to market entry.  Concentrating on specific use cases and target markets can enhance the likelihood of success in a competitive landscape.

# Investment Considerations and Valuation Approaches

Given the pre-revenue nature of most eVTOL companies, traditional valuation metrics are of limited use. Investors should consider:

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**:

* Projecting future cash flows based on market size estimates and company-specific factors
* High discount rates to account for technology and market risks

**Real Options Valuation**:

* Accounting for the value of strategic flexibility in an uncertain market

**Comparable Company Analysis**:

* Utilizing metrics from adjacent industries (e.g., electric vehicles, aerospace)
* Key metrics: EV/Total Addressable Market, Price-to-Book

**Milestone-based Valuation**:

* Assigning value to achievement of key technical and regulatory milestones

# My Long View

Despite the challenges, I'm optimistic about the future of eVTOLs. The potential benefits in terms of reduced traffic congestion, faster emergency response times, and new transportation options for underserved areas are too significant to ignore.

But it's going to take time. The winners in this space will be the companies that can combine technical innovation with business acumen and regulatory savvy. They'll need the patience to navigate a long and complex development process, and the flexibility to adapt their strategies as the market evolves.",09-25-2024

They are still early in ramp with higher production costs, but building more of a car than Tesla offers and working with less subsidies than Tesla originally had. Yet, they have key production growth, and are prepped for the acceleration of their product demand with both commercial vehicles and consumer vehicles.¬† 

**Factory Upgrades and Focus on Margin**

Rivian has guided towards seeing better margins this fall, in part from the re-tooling seen this last May. [Normal Site Retooling](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/rivian-completes-plant-retooling-pivotal-to-profitability/715673/) 

They are continuing to invest in their site, with approved plans to build out a larger space and prepare for R2 production, both of these upgrades leading to over 215,000 units of capacity across the R1 / R2 / Commercial platforms they offer. [R2 Site Expansion](https://electrek.co/2024/08/20/rivian-rivn-approved-major-plant-expansion-r2/#:~:text=Rivian%20gets%20the%20green%20light%20for%20massive%20plant%20expansion&text=The%20amendments%20to%20its%20site,ft%2C%20or%20roughly%205%25) 

Further, the VW Partnership further mentioned below has already brought tailwinds and initial cost savings, and will likely further support long term profitability. [VW Partnership Cost Savings](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/rivian-supplier-cost-savings-vw-partnership-earnings-q2/723660/)

**Production Analysis**¬†

Recently in another group, a user posted their production analysis, and it‚Äôs following Tesla‚Äôs quite well: [Rivian vs. Tesla Production Ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1f2yk9y/comparing_rivian_and_teslas_production_ramp/?share_id=67dj9Qr_8DjKXpFglZzfQ&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)¬†

While Rivian is still early, they‚Äôve already shown what the R2 ([R2 / R3 walkthrough with RJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Gt_PUyldc)¬†) and R3 - ([R3 Design walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoBBibT_IAI)) -  will look like, and people are EXCITED for them to come out in 2026 (R3X potentially fall '26 or later).¬†¬†

While we see headwinds in the EV industry, as time goes on EV infrastructure will continue to increase, furthering EV adoption (including Rivian).¬†¬†It doesn't seem like Tesla will be the only pure-play EV company to survive.

So who is buying Rivians currently?¬†¬†

Tesla owners, among others. More Rivians are being sold, and they are starting to be a choice among Subaru owners (a sticky owner usually), Tesla owners trading up, and even first time EV owners. Plenty of people from EVs to ICE vehicles are trading up and into Rivians, and are loving them!¬†¬†

It makes sense the love for Rivian current owners have ‚Äì it is a beautifully designed vehicle around the user, made with intelligent features people love to use from adventuring to everyday driving.¬†

Importantly, it‚Äôs also built around the technological architecture of the vehicle. Instead of other vehicles with 100 different computers that don‚Äôt talk well with each other, Rivian is building each platform as a tech-first platform, which is why VW ‚Äì who has struggled with their own software and advancing tech internally ‚Äì has partnered with Rivian, to the tune of $5 Billion when the company was worth $10 Billion.¬†  
¬†  
VW still has $4B more to invest in¬†Rivian, so adding that to the $8B in cash they had as of their last earnings report, and Rivian is worth more today and long term.¬†

**Partnerships**¬†

Rivian has some large backing, between the Amazon contract they are producing for, and the VW Rivian Partnership. VW is a large player with many brands like Porsche, VW, Audi, and more ‚Äì but they‚Äôve struggled trying to build better tech internally. For a group seeing headwinds in the industry and China, partnering with Rivian isn‚Äôt a risk they would take if they didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äì while the partnership is important for Rivian, it‚Äôs incredibly important for VW as well, including the level of due diligence needed for a $5B investment in Rivian.¬†([VW Struggles with Software](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/07/11/volkswagen-rivian-joint-venture)) Notably, while we talk about Rivian vehicle production and ramp, it's Rivian's tech-first focus and the way they've built a vehicle around the technology which also differentiates them and attracts VW to this deal.

Additionally, while Rivian continues to produce and deliver vans for Amazon, they are now also able to sell similar vans to other companies. While Amazon was the first, this adds to the moat Rivian is working to develop that defends their positioning ‚Äì commercial EV sale -.[Rivian Commercial Vans](https://rivian.com/fleet). As the demand for last-mile delivery grows, Rivian is well positioned to take market share in the commercial space as well as consumer space.¬†

**Team**¬†

While Tesla has a crazy cult following, combined with Elon Musk‚Äôs cult following, RJ is similarly an engineer at heart but is a down to earth guy that also has a PH.D. from MIT. His exec team has experience across the auto landscape, having experience previously at Tesla, Chrysler, Volvo, Stellantis, and Jeep, as well as Apple, JPM, and more. His team is experienced across different facets of the industry, and brings both a tech focus with auto experience into Rivian's design, production, and overall customer focus.

**Summary**

EVs have plenty of headwinds, but considering how much existing customers love the product, the excitement for what is coming for the brand, the cash on hand and backing from VW, the commercial vehicle side, and overall positioning, I think the risk is worth the significant upside Rivian is positioned for.

THE SINGULARITY HAS BEGUN

  


  
I'm not sure if you're paying any fucking attention to what nerds are building these days. Let's look at a few examples: 

- To start, Waymo has solved self-driving. Tesla is on the cusp of doing the same

- Tesla and like 5 other companies are about to come out with actual fucking cyborgs. Robot slaves are almost here. Be sure to treat yours nicely. 

- People are already falling in love with chatbots (imagine cyborgs v2?)

- TSMC and Nvidia turn literal sand into rocks that can teach themselves anything 

- People want these magic rocks so bad that nuclear power has been resurrected from the dead so we can use the hot rocks to power the smart rocks

- Oh and OpenAI just dropped their new model o1, creating yet another way to turn more GPU cycles into more intelligence. Except this time, the algorithm is less efficient. A \*linear\* improvement with \*exponential\* increase in GPU/energy. Meaning demand for GPUs just ...shot up... again (sounds crazy, but I see at least a doubling here). Nvidia isn't the only beneficiary here, but I expect that capture 90% of this newly discovered demand (more on this in another post)

[$200 before the gopher sees his shadow](https://preview.redd.it/o5trxpcnhipd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6a067248a3b70438c6db77c81fa12e92603341)





POWELL IS A GENIUS

  


On to the main story of the day - what is Mr Pow-Pow gonna do? 

He's smart enough to understand that the stickiest part about inflation is housing. And no amount of low rates will ever solve housing. We can't choose to spend less on housing. Millenials and zoomers are fucking crammed in together. Housing has a supply issue. Not enough of it. And how is that solved? Build more. What does that cost? Money.

  
As paradoxical as it sounds, the solution to inflation has now become more money. We need construction to boom. Luckily, it is starting to. 

Powell also knows how to get a good price. How to ""stretch"" out his bps for the biggest societal changes.. Remember how skillfully he used the mere suggestion of rates drops to heat the economy up earlier this year. He got all that for 0 bps. 

So how can he get the most bang for his buck here? Start out with a bang. All else equal, a 50 bps now will create a bigger ""push"" of excitement through society than would two 25 bps back to back. He knows this. He'd rather give you 50 pbs now than 75 bps over 3. That's strategy - focussing on the war not the battle. So he creates a giant sigh of relief. He'll give us more up front. A nice little surprise from Santa Clause

Then the tapering will be slower than expected. That will get dialed back as the initial push shows to be effective. It'll be a classic Powell Tease. 

[HE'S BACK](https://preview.redd.it/0fl33yq1cipd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a7be47a5cf12cf2080edcbca884990130a774a)





THE GREAT ROTATION IS A MIRAGE





  
We are entering an Age of Great Monopolies. Yes, the S&P500 is concentrated. But look around - globalization and rapidly changing high-tech have made economies of scale that are completely unbeatable. The richest people in the world have hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the new normal. 

  
Are you really gonna drop Amazon...or Nvidia...just to scoop up companies that have higher debt, because now that debt is worth slightly less? You want banks ridden with corporate property debt and underwater T-bills? Amazon will have next hour delivery. Tesla is going to have i Robots. People are already falling in love with sex robots. 

  
The singularity is here. This is what it looks like. You may not like it but this is what peak acceleration looks like. That means you should be expecting exponential growth, and looking for companies going through it. Buy and hold or calls if you have too much money.

"Balance before the storm, the week ahead.MANY DOUBTED MY PREVIOUS ARTICLE BUT MOST OF MY CALLS WERE PERFECT: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fbgpyh/why_the_market_bottomed_on_friday_a_technical/

# What's next?

## Balance before the storm

Yes, I know there are always a few out there who scoffed at my bullish calls last week. I get it‚Äîyou‚Äôve been conditioned by fear, anxiety, and headlines screaming about recessions and doom. But while you‚Äôve been stuck in your perpetual state of ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt last,‚Äù the market has entered a phase of equilibrium. The bulls are gaining strength, the bears are losing steam, and we‚Äôre sitting at the tipping point.

This week, the S&P 500 (SPX) will likely go nowhere‚Äîgive or take a measly 0.5%. But within that broad stillness, there are opportunities. As I said before, I'm still holding onto my $600 call for Meta by 11/11, and now, I‚Äôve added a $250 call for Tesla as well. Why? Because the setups for these two stocks are that compelling, and anyone betting against them is simply ignoring the writing on the wall. But there's more brewing this week, including an under-the-radar SMCI catalyst and the geopolitical noise that never seems to let up. Let‚Äôs dig in.

### The Bulls Are Ready, The Bears Are Tired
We‚Äôre entering a rare moment of balance this week. The bears, after months of trying to claw the market down, are losing momentum. It‚Äôs no surprise‚Äîtheir thesis was built on inflation fears, rate hikes, and market collapses that have yet to materialize in any significant way. Sure, the economic data is mixed, and yes, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs game of chicken with the economy continues. But in reality, the worst-case scenarios haven‚Äôt played out. And the bulls? They‚Äôre rested, ready, and growing stronger by the day.

This week, expect the SPX to consolidate. +/- 0.5%, at most, as the market digests the ongoing news flow. It‚Äôs a classic tug-of-war situation, where the opposing sides are evenly matched. Bulls have been fortified by recent strength in big tech (Meta, Tesla), while bears are nursing wounds from failed short positions. It‚Äôs a delicate balance‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be surprised if the scale tips toward a breakout soon. My bets are positioned accordingly.

### Meta: The $600 Target Is Alive
First up, Meta. Let‚Äôs be real, if you didn‚Äôt already jump on this train when I first mentioned it, you‚Äôre already behind. Last week, Meta continued to show relative strength, outperforming even in a market that‚Äôs trying to catch its breath. And the setup only looks better going forward. The metaverse, digital advertising recovery, and AI momentum‚ÄîMeta has all the catalysts to reach $600 by 11/11. If you're still doubting this, you clearly haven't been watching the technicals. Momentum is on our side.

I‚Äôm still holding onto my $600C, and if the market gives us any pullback this week, I‚Äôll probably add more. Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you.

### Tesla: Charging Towards $250
As for Tesla, my new $250 call is straightforward. Tesla has been trading in a tight range, coiling like a spring. When Tesla consolidates like this, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the breakout happens, and I‚Äôm betting that it‚Äôs going to be upward. Between the continued push into EV dominance, Elon‚Äôs ongoing antics that somehow keep Tesla in the headlines, and institutional money that loves to chase momentum, Tesla is primed.

Look, Tesla has defied gravity for years, and its ability to move with news-driven momentum is second to none. With nothing but green skies ahead, $250 feels conservative. I‚Äôll happily ride the wave higher.

### SMCI: The Under-the-Radar Winner
Now, let‚Äôs talk about SMCI. I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on this one for a while, and with their 10K expected this week, I‚Äôm looking to load up on some calls before the release. This is one of those quiet setups where the risk/reward ratio is too good to pass up. SMCI has been steadily gaining traction, and while it‚Äôs not plastered across every financial news headline, the fundamentals speak for themselves.

Once that 10K drops, I expect the stock to move, and those of us who were paying attention beforehand are going to profit. Watch closely here‚Äîdon‚Äôt sleep on it.

### The Noise: Futures Rollovers, FOMC, and Geopolitical Drama
Of course, no week is complete without some good old-fashioned chaos. Futures are rolling over this week, which means we could see some positioning shifts from the big players. This always adds an extra layer of volatility, especially when you combine it with the Fed‚Äôs looming FOMC meeting. Everyone will be dissecting Jerome Powell‚Äôs every word, as always, but if you‚Äôve been watching carefully, you‚Äôll notice a softer tone from the Fed. They‚Äôre trying to engineer a soft landing, and while I have my doubts about their precision, the market is liking what it hears.

Then there‚Äôs the elephant in the room: Mango. There are ripple effects from the latest developments in his ongoing legal saga, with new speculation swirling about potential international involvement. Ukraine? Russia? Who knows at this point, but geopolitical uncertainty always adds a little spice to the market‚Äôs reaction. Throw in the fact that no one can seem to locate Ms.Plan ‚Äîwhere is it?

### Final Thoughts: Keep Betting on Winners
In summary, this week might be flat for the broader market, but there are pockets of opportunity for those who know where to look. The bulls are gaining strength, the bears are weakening, and we‚Äôre at a moment of equilibrium. But don‚Äôt get lulled into complacency. Meta and Tesla are leading the charge, and SMCI is gearing up to surprise everyone. Meanwhile, the political and economic noise will continue to distract the masses. Stay focused on the winners, and you‚Äôll be the one laughing at the doubters in the end.

"The Odd Couple - Waymo & Uber Join ForcesIn the world of autonomous vehicles and ride-hailing, a new power couple has emerged:¬†**Waymo**¬†and¬†**Uber.**¬†Once fierce competitors vying for dominance in the autonomous driving space, they have now joined forces in a strategic partnership that has sent ripples through the industry.¬†

This article will explore this unlikely alliance, analyzing the financial and strategic motivations behind it, the potential benefits and risks for both companies, and the overall impact on the future of transportation

# From Rivals to Partners: A Shift in Strategy

The Waymo-Uber partnership, initially announced in May 2023 and expanded in September 2024, marks a significant shift in strategy for both companies.¬†

**Uber**, once heavily invested in developing its own autonomous driving technology, has since exited that endeavor and pivoted to a platform-based approach. This partnership allows them to integrate Waymo's proven technology into their ride-hailing app without the substantial R&D costs and risks.

**Waymo**, on the other hand, gains immediate access to Uber's massive user base and operational infrastructure, accelerating the deployment and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service.

# A Look at the Financials

Understanding the financial motivations behind this partnership is crucial.

**Uber**, despite showing strong financial performance in 2023 and early 2024 with 15% revenue growth, a shift to profitability, and strong cash flow generation (revenue of $37.3 billion in 2023 and $10.1 billion in Q1 2024, operating profit of $1.1 billion in 2023 and $1.4 billion free cash flow in Q1 2024)^(\[2\]\[4\]), is facing increasing pressure from investors regarding its long-term prospects in the face of autonomous driving disruption^(\[1\]). This partnership allows them to mitigate this risk and position themselves for future growth.

**Waymo**, while not publicly disclosing detailed financials, has received a new $5 billion investment from parent company Alphabet in July 2024, highlighting their continued commitment to the project^(\[3\]). The partnership with Uber offers a faster path to profitability by leveraging Uber's existing infrastructure and customer base, potentially accelerating Waymo's estimated $1.4 billion annual revenue^(\[6\]). Additionally, Waymo's financials are embedded within Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, which reported $285 million revenue and $813 million operating loss in Q2 2023 and $365 million revenue and $1.13 billion operating loss in Q2 2024^(\[7\]).

# A Win-Win Situation?

**For Uber:**

* Access to Waymo's advanced AV technology without the associated R&D costs.
* Potential to increase market share by offering autonomous options to their riders.
* Improved operational efficiency and reduced costs in the long term with autonomous vehicles.
* A strategic move to future-proof their business model and remain a leader in the mobility market.

**For Waymo:**

* Rapid expansion and scaling of its autonomous ride-hailing service through Uber's platform.
* Increased visibility and user adoption of its technology.
* Potential for accelerated revenue growth.

# However, the partnership also presents certain risks:

**For Uber:**

* Dependency risk on Waymo's technology.
* Potential for brand dilution if Waymo's technology encounters issues or negative public perception.
* Risk of cannibalization of its existing ride-hailing business with the introduction of autonomous vehicles.

**For Waymo:**

* Potential conflicts with Uber regarding strategic goals or operational approaches.
* Regulatory scrutiny due to market dominance concerns.
* Limited control over the user experience and branding within the Uber app.

# The Road Ahead

The long-term success of this partnership will hinge on several factors:

1. **Regulatory Landscape**: Navigating the complex and evolving regulations surrounding autonomous vehicles will be crucial.
2. **Public Acceptance**: Overcoming public skepticism and ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles will be paramount for widespread adoption.
3. **Competitive Landscape**: The rapid development and deployment of autonomous driving technology by other players like Tesla (whose robotaxi announcement caused Uber's stock to fall 9%) will require both companies to continuously innovate and stay ahead of the curve^(\[4\])¬†.¬†

The Waymo-Uber partnership, presents a fascinating case study of how former rivals can adapt and collaborate to navigate technological disruption and shape the future of their industry.

"$RIVN ‚Äì Long-Term Potential or Just Another EV Gamble? Seeking OpinionsI‚Äôve been keeping an eye on Rivian ($RIVN) and wanted to get some thoughts from the community. With Amazon backing them (100,000 electric delivery vans ordered) and rumors of a potential deal with Volkswagen, Rivian seems to have some POTENTIALLY strong momentum behind it. Their focus on electric trucks and SUVs gives them a unique position in the market compared to Tesla's dominance in sedans.

That said, they‚Äôve faced some notable production delays and supply chain issues. On top of that, competition in the EV space is fierce, with major players like Tesla, GM, and Ford pushing into the electric truck/SUV market. 

I'm curious to hear from anyone with more insights: Is Rivian a solid long-term play, or are we looking at bankruptcy? What are your thoughts on their ability to scale production and meet expectations, especially as we head into 2025?

What are your thoughts? Does TESLA have room for gains in the next 18 months? I feel like MSTR would have better returns in that time frame but curious what all the regards are thinking. I realize this is all speculation but interested in any insight.

My position 
Fellow degenerates, we stand on the brink of history. Forget SMCI, QQQ, even Tesla! Today, we fight for the future, the next great titan:INTEL ($INTC). This isn‚Äôt just a stock, this is the Infinity Stone of Tech Stocks. üíéü¶ç

We all laughed when Intel fell behind, when AMD and Nvidia seemed like the Thanos of chips. But Intel is Iron Man, baby. Old, reliable, and gearing up for the comeback of the century.

The Vision: Intel's long game is power efficiency, AI chips, and their 7nm breakthrough. You thought they were snapped out of existence? Wrong! They‚Äôve been in the Quantum Realm, grinding to make sure they can snap the competition away. They‚Äôre about to snap their competition into dust.

The Play: 
Options? You want 'em? Load up. Shares? Stack 'em. We‚Äôre not just hodling, we‚Äôre creating the next big **moon mission**. They‚Äôve got Arc GPUs, Meteor Lake, and a battle plan to take down the chip overlords.

THE BULL CASE:
- AI Chips: Think Wakanda tech. Ready to change the world.

We‚Äôre all in this together. Remember how the Avengers fought against impossible. They may have fallen, but they‚Äôre about to RISE UP.

üíéü¶ç HODL. BUY. BELIEVE.

"Calling the top on $TSLA. Change my mind1. Sales. Tesla sales are down, and I think they will keep falling. There‚Äôs no EV winter, Ford etc. are doing fine. People are buying EVs, just not Teslas.

2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn‚Äôt on Tesla right now.

3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. 

4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could‚Äôve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he‚Äôs alienated them more than ever. 

He‚Äôs also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)

5. His public (mis)behavior. Going on full jousts with the biggest western governments while cozying up with the dictatorships (Saudi, Turkey) won‚Äôt serve him. His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world‚Äôs largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov‚Äôs current situation. 

6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He‚Äôs been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it‚Äôs not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.

7. X is bleeding cash. He‚Äôll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he‚Äôs not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won‚Äôt sell it either.

Based on the above. I call a top.

"SMCI - this is far from overSMCI has some nice niche products, but SMCI‚Äôs margins are tiny because they offer nothing proprietary.  
I have a feeling that they were on a roll, but the management couldn't quite keep up with success and the stock went up too high in valuation believing the company internally could keep up with the pressure.

For a company which has no moat, has shrinking margins and is again encompassed in accounting problems, I don't see an upside. I can understand that mistakes happen, but this is becoming a pattern recidivist behavior, and in my book, the trust is seriously shaken, if not lost.

I can understand skepticism around Hindenburg report, but withholding the release of annual report (10-K) is a big no no. Some jumped to SMCI's defense that they did so because of Hindenburg report to make double-checks, but why would you need to double-check a report which was previously audited by independent party (EY) and is supposed to be ready for submitting weeks ahead of deadline?  
For those that aren't aware, 10-K is a kind of report that contains comprehensive overview of company's financial performance over the past fiscal year, but also includes audited financial statements, unlike quarter reports which are less detailed and are unaudited ([link to 10-Q](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&ref=318292688&type=HTML&symbol=SMCI&cdn=f006c6d17a8677ce2f9e8b184a14bbb0&companyName=Super+Micro+Computer+Inc.&formType=10-Q&formDescription=General+form+for+quarterly+reports+under+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&dateFiled=2024-05-06)). 10-K also includes discussion and analysis (MD&A), risk factors, organizational structure, executive compensation, subsidiaries, and more.

Moreover, there are reports that buyers (such as CoreWeave, Tesla, Amazon AWS, Digital Ocean, to name a few) are switching to competition (which has higher margins), and from being the top customer, to having Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly endorsing their competiton ([‚ÄúNobody is better at building end-to-end systems of very large scale for the enterprise than Dell.‚Äù](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-escapes-nvidia-shadow-own-133820520.html)),one has to ask - what is really going on?

I believe that, at least partially, the reason lies in that (to quote [mod from SCMI subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SMCI_Stock/comments/1emlh0s/comment/lklblb9/?context=3)) *SMCI was very cheap in 2022 and 2023 when the circumstances were different. Nobody knew about their success back then, which allowed them to avoid competition and actually increase sales and margins.*  
*Now is a different story: they are at diseconomies of scale and diluting shareholders to finance their operations. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see SMCI drop to the 300s or lower and never recover because they are just a commodity company now.*  
Dell, HPE and Lenovo aren't resting and have joined the server building market in the meantime.

Institutions which haven't closed their positions already will have a hard time explaining why they kept their position when this stocks sinks even more.

Even insiders believe in everything so much, that the insider net stock purchases in last 12 months amount to 0. One would think that they would grab stocks with hands over fist with this ""great discount"", but I guess they don't want more shares. Source: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/smci/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/smci/insider-activity)

Buybacks? With increased CAPEX and lower margins, the need for money for R&D, and with history of dilutions, I'd be more concerned of further dilutions.

To top it all of, in all these commotions, some of you might have missed a little interesting detail. On August 15, 2024 SMCI added Susie Giordano to it's board of directors. ([Link](https://ir.supermicro.com/governance/board-of-directors/person-details/default.aspx?ItemId=ce4d4770-623d-4e66-a6c9-2679d0c68221))  
Her background is law, and *Ms. Giordano has over 25 years of experience advising executive management and board directors on a wide range of topics, including strategy,* ***litigation, compliance, regulatory matters, corporate governance***, ESG, executive compensation, ***financial reporting, crisis management***\*, cybersecurity, human capital management, ***investor relations***, M&A, ***securities, shareholder engagement, and treasury matters***.  
To me, this is very peculiar timing. She gets appointed to board of directors just mere (12) days before Hindenburg reveals their report and before we find out about 10-K delay, indicating that there could be undisclosed problems and SMCI management is/was aware of it. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

With all that said, I am very bearish on this stock and will be buying long puts.

TL;DR: SMCI is a total dumpster fire - no moat, shrinking margins, losing big clients, and can't even get their 10-K out. Insiders aren't touching the stock, and now they're bringing in a lawyer - betting on this sinking ship with puts all day!",08-30-2024
"5 reasons I‚Äôm in nvda shortNvidia‚Äôs q2 performance was great but the market was expecting it better because nvidia has been taking over Apple‚Äôs place. Tell you guys why I‚Äôm against nvidia tho this company is great and I still see the potential for the ai boom
1. Slowing down the growth : 
Like I said the market expects nvda‚Äôs higher growth. Compared to apple, Microsoft, except for the growth and profit rate, everything else is lower than the other two. 

2. Delay of Blackwell 
There‚Äôs a bit of delay of the product. No matter how early or late they can produce it. It just increases uncertainty like Tesla‚Äôs robotaxi day.  

3.  Lower net profit margin
The company still has super high net profit margin but in q2 it‚Äôs a bit lower than last quarter and it will go down next quarter too since tsmc has increased  manufacturing cost. 

4. Buyback 
It smells so sus. The company seems to try to cover something so has announced buyback while the ceo and insiders have been selling the shares and this also proves the Blackwell delay. 

5. Seasonal short month
September is one of dip months! Today the market seems alright with all the indices like jobless, pce and gdp but there‚Äôs a lot of selling. What if the market takes a break for a couple of weeks? 

This is my very personal view that have been watching nvidia since last year and missed out! But I succeed to make a profit from nvidia 3x inverse when it hit $140 and also nvidia x3 leverage when It hit $90 lately.

"Nvidia reports 122% revenue growth on surging demand for data center chipsNvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.

Nvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.

Here is how the company did versus LSEG consensus expectations:

Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected
Revenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected
Nvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.

Revenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.

Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. 

Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.

Revenue in Nvidia‚Äôs data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.

Not all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the company‚Äôs networking products.

Much of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidia‚Äôs chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT.

"NVIDIA‚Äôs next catalyst has to be sovereign AI.NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation is not overtly expensive (FPER: 33, PEG: 1.61 according to FINVIZ) and the GPU orders for next year are all booked. Yet the stock is meeting strong resistance around $130. I think this is partially because a lot of people have been burned by CISCO during dot-com bubble and do not want to price in the future too much. But the real concern is that their revenue is almost entirely dependent on the rest of M7 and they are charging the big tech 80 % margin. The big tech, while being hammered by Wall Street for the increased CAPEX spending, indicated during last earning that they will not reduce their investment on AI. However, they did mention that they are/plan using their NPU (Google TPU, Tesla Dojo, AMD) to reduce the usage of NVIDIA GPU.

Furthermore, GPT5 and Apple Intelligence should be available to the public by the end of this year. If these do not impress, the entire AI sector may see significant slowdown. But if GPT5 shows plateauing of performance while people find Apple Intelligence interesting, paradigm could shift toward smaller models and inference efficiency, again reducing the demand for NVIDIA.

To justify significant increase in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock price, they need to show that they are not entirely dependent on the Big Tech. The only other potential buyers that have as much buying power are governments. Also, if the economy is going through downturns, governments have excuse to increase their spending. What I am paying attention to during the earning call is demonstration from NVIDIA that they are receiving significant demand from non-Big Tech such as governments.",08-28-2024
"Nvidia Earnings Preview: AI Capex will continue riding the tailwind, faces Antitrust ConcernsNvidia is likely to report its fiscal 2025 Q2 earnings on Aug. 28, is poised to be one of this year's most important stock market events, and anticipation is sky-high.

**Here are Key Focal Points about Nvidia's Earning:**

With its last quarterly report, Microsoft announced AI spending is poised to continue climbing over the next year. Microsoft is widely believed to be Nvidia's largest customer, and increased spending on AI infrastructure is a clear bullish indicator. Another big customer Meta, also raised its capital-spending guidance range. Tesla had strong demands for Nvidia‚Äôs chips.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said, The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here. That should be tailwind of Nvidia shareholders.

Nvidia also reported received orders of its A800 GPU worth $5 billion from Chinese tech giants, including Baidu, ByteDance, Tencent, and Alibaba, amid fears of the new export restrictions.

**Nvidia also faces risks:**

There may be more trouble brewing around potential production delays of Nvidia's next generation Blackwell AI chips, means revenue growth might take a hit.

There are also mounting antitrust concerns. US and France regulators are probing.

The company reaching the law of large numbers here, once a company gets to a certain size, it just physically can't keep up the same growth,"" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital.

"Why Ouster (OUST) is winning the Lidar cage match**What is Lidar?**

* Chatbots are great, but Lidar is the key to unlocking AI's potential in the real world. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is like bat echolocation with lasers, for a precise 3D model of the surroundings.
* Humans are squishy! So autonomous machines must track their environment with 100% reliability. But cameras fail in certain conditions, as seen in this [Tesla dashcam](https://x.com/greentheonly/status/1473307236952940548).
* Ouster has honed the long-term winning type of Lidar.

**Why OUST's variant of Lidar is the future**

* OUST specializes in [multi-beam flash Lidar](https://ouster.com/insights/blog/how-multi-beam-flash-lidar-works), which enjoys structural advantages in cost, compactness, durability and power efficiency. Historically, it lacked the range of legacy designs with moving parts. However, OUST has finally closed this performance gap.¬†
* OUST's approach uniquely benefits from advancements in the consumer electronics industry, which drives down costs while improving performance, a-la Moore‚Äôs law. See: laser printers, fiber optics, VR headsets, FaceId, fitness trackers and smart glasses.
* Ouster‚Äôs DF2 sensor has 240 meters of range and will be sold for automotive use in 2025.

**A clear path to profitability**

* OUST sells to customers across 15 industries, versus relying on one aspirational auto partnership. This creates stable revenue and strong pricing power, generating the cash to achieve automotive-grade performance. Their sensors already power [Amazon‚Äôs latest warehouse robots](https://www.reddit.com/r/OUST/comments/15upziw/amazon_robot_fleet_and_how_its_extending_to/).
* OUST already makes money on each LiDAR unit sold, with +29% gross margin in 1Q24. Whereas their US competitors lose money on every LiDAR unit sold (i.e., gross margins below -80%).
* Last year, they launched a complementary software product (BlueCity) with recurring, high-margin revenue. Customers love it because it reduces the time-to-value for OUST sensors.
* OUST is close to breakeven, with $4.7m in cash outflow in 1Q24 and $189m in cash reserves. So they won‚Äôt need to raise debt or significantly dilute shareholders, unlike competitors with huge interest payments and quarters of runway left.

**Attractive entry price, with insiders buying ahead of today‚Äôs earnings release**

* OUST shares fell 33% since mid-July for no fundamental reason. Just the Yen carry trade unwind and terrible 2Q earnings from Lidar competitors. Like [Luminar Technologies (LAZR)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LAZR/) who reported a 22% sequential rev decline, dilutive debt restructuring, new debt with a 14% interest rate and -88% gross margins.
* Insiders doubled-down on OUST by [buying shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/oust/insider-activity) on May 15th, halfway the quarter whose results come out later today.
* OUST guided to $110m revenue for 2024 (+40% y/y), gross margins in the mid-high 30s and profitability by year end. **Given they beat guidance the past three quarters, today‚Äôs market cap of $500m may never be seen again.**

**Risks to thesis:**

* While Hesai (HSAI), a Chinese manufacturer, enjoys higher revenue thanks to automotive contracts, their 2Q revenue declined y/y and the US military labeled them a national security risk.
* OUST lacks major automotive partnerships, which can generate huge amounts of recurring revenue upon commercialization. However, their first sensor optimized for this space, DF2, will be sold in 2025.
* A recession could slow down investments in industrial automation, delaying their path to profitability and requiring shareholder dilution. On the flip side, this would probably kill their debt-laden, negative gross margin competitors.
* Stock is up 56% YTD still! But this seems warranted given repeated revenue beats, gross margin expansion and a successful merger (Velodyne) with $120m in cost savings ahead of schedule.

**Disclaimer:** Ouster is a risky investment, and I hold over 25% of my portfolio in OUST. This is not financial advice and you should do your own research before making any investment decision.",08-13-2024

"SMCI - Ideals are full, but reality isn'tSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) announced its third-quarter and next year's outlook after the market closed. The 2025 revenue is expected to exceed the market expectation of $23.6 billion, with the company estimating annual revenue to be between $26 billion and $30 billion. Additionally, they announced a 10-for-1 stock split in October, both considered positive news.

üö® However, the second-quarter financial report is not looking good. Although the revenue of $5.31 billion slightly exceeded the market expectation of $5.3 billion, the adjusted EPS was only $6.25, far below the market expectation of $8.07.

In simple terms, the financial report and forecast have mixed results, causing the stock price to experience extreme volatility in after-hours trading. Initially, it surged by more than 20%, but then selling pressure quickly emerged, causing a vertical drop. Currently, it has fallen by more than 11%, showing dramatic fluctuations that truly live up to its reputation as a volatile stock üìâ.

I believe this is mainly because the market is still focused on whether the AI theme can achieve actual returns. After the valuation is highly inflated, profits must be significantly better than the market expects.

üëâ The issue with Super Micro Computer is not just that the EPS is below expectations, but the gap with the market expectation of $8.07 is very large. This discrepancy is the largest in the past five years for any quarter. This high discrepancy occurred because investors were overly optimistic about the growth of AI servers, resulting in such a large deviation in actual profits. This perfectly illustrates the saying ""ideals are very full, but reality is very skinny.""

Additionally, the second-quarter gross profit margin quickly dropped to only 11.2%, down 5.8% from the same period last year, and more than 4% lower than the 15.5% in the first quarter, hitting a new low since May 2007. A continuous decline in gross profit margin is definitely not a good sign; just look at Tesla. Although Super Micro Computer's revenue continues to grow and slightly exceeds expectations, the gross profit margin is rapidly declining. Selling more but earning less will make the market worry that this industry might be getting too competitive.

Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade

In a classic case of ‚Äúso close, yet so far,‚Äù Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company‚Äôs disappointing Azure cloud revenue.

Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints

Microsoft‚Äôs revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure‚Äôs performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue‚Äîjust shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub‚Äôs impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn‚Äôt enough to quell investor concerns.

By the Numbers

Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected

Market Reaction and Future Outlook

While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft‚Äôs other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure‚Äôs growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn‚Äôt enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft‚Äôs shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500‚Äôs 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market‚Äôs laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

  
Chips Ahoy! AMD‚Äôs Data Center Sales Surge 115%

AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let‚Äôs break it down.

Earnings Breakdown

AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter

AI Chips and Data Center Dominance

The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company‚Äôs overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.

Other Segments and Market Reaction

While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD‚Äôs business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year

AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.

  
On The Horizon

Tomorrow‚Äôs labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week‚Äôs job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.

Boeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.

Marriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Meta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta‚Äôs spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

Rate Cut Countdown ‚Äî Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger?

Nope, the Fed isn‚Äôt cutting rates this week. But don‚Äôt snooze just yet‚Äîthis meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn‚Äôt overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy‚Äîhe's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.

Inflation: Cooling Off

Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year‚Äôs 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We‚Äôre on the right track, folks.
Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it‚Äôs taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell‚Äôs recent take? The labor market isn‚Äôt adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù‚Äîbalancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.

Risk Management Reboot

With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed‚Äôs risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle‚Äîslightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed‚Äôs past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they‚Äôre determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.

Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it‚Äôs time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn‚Äôt seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.

The Fed‚Äôs balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.


McDonald‚Äôs: The Golden Arches Stumble

By the Numbers

Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)
Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)
Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)
U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%
International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%
International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%

McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.

Value Meals to the Rescue

The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn‚Äôt translated into higher overall sales just yet.

Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.

Defying the Odds

Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.

Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell.

Looking Forward

The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.

So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

On The Horizon

Tomorrow
Economic Data and Earnings

This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.

Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Before Market Open

Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning‚Äôs traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn‚Äôt deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.

Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a ""buy"" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.",07-29-2024

Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage.

**The current situation**

Look at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis.

Nvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the ""blow-off"" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. 

Big volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. 

I expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red.

**Upcoming earnings**

What are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59  per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. 

How conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit.

"Market Is Offsides on $PCT - Highest Days to Cover I've Seen (Yes, MORE than with <redacted>)**Important Intro**

There are DD posts on here which simply pointing out that a stock has high Sh--t Int-rest. To me these are not interesting because the market is almost always aware of this (SI is disclosed on FINRA).

Most of the time, this SI is managed by market makers, active pod shops and L/S, etc. They have it under control and don't let anything get too crazy. The real opportunity comes when something is both fundamentally cheap and the market misunderstands the long/sh-rt dynamics. *This is what allows things to get out of hand and catches MMs and others offsides.* And I believe this is currently occurring with $PCT. Let's dive in.

**Market Dynamics**

When people simply look at SI on Fintel or whatever they are fundamentally misunderstanding what constitutes opportunity. For example, they do not compare SI to:

* Who holds shares and are they long term investors?
* Are the shares passively held and therefore won't be sold?
* Are they held by a cult and/or true believers who never sell?
* Is there dilution and warrants?
* Does the company need cash (e.g. offerings allow for covering).

Superficially $PCT has like 25% SI. However, let's run through the above with $PCT:

* 163m diluted share count
* \~30m shares are passively held, e.g. insensitivity to buying and selling.
* \~80m shares held by committed LT investors, e.g. people who have participated in debt raises and publicly committed to holding
* \~30m Insider owned shares

Nearly 90% of the float is short! This is all not even including ""semi diamond hands"", e.g. the fact that among the other owners there are several other long funds who have held for years, and likely won't sell either at these levels. 

I'd estimate the ""real tradable float"" is something like 30m. Now compare that to the 42m shares short and the picture becomes clear. **This yields 23 days to cover... per NASDAQ... which I believe is higher than we've ever seen with almost anything... and even with <redacted stock>!**

I don't want to speculate. But if momentum continues, things could get basically unfathomable.

**Narrative Dynamics**

Here's where things really get interesting. $PCT has a lot of very well connected, very smart, and very influential advocates. They include:

1. Dan Gilbert, manager of a $3b fund and a big PCT investor who has staked his reputation on the company. *He has diamond hands*. He didn't sell in the $2s when the stock was super down, and now the stock is $7+!
2. Porter Collins, famous shortseller, who is actively interested in the name on Twitter
3. Michael Taylor, manager of $PINK ETF which donates all proceeds to breast cancer
4. Pulte, a billionaire who has 3m followers on Twitter and loves tweeting about stocks, e.g. see what he did with $BZFD recently, has begun looking into the name per his replies on the app

The stock has begun to move up.

**Valuation and Underlying Potential**

The company itself may be fundamentally undervalued, too. There are several good writeups on it. However there are several short reports as well. One thing is clear: fundamentally, this company is needed for the future of the world. This company has *world-leading* and completely unique microplastic recycling ability.

Almost all plastic ends up in landfills -> becomes microplastics -> ends up in our bodies. There's ample evidence this has health effects like decreasing sperm counts. And we don't know, long term, what it can do.

I've seen several people smarter than I map out this company financially assuming it's plant gets to capacity (or even half capacity). The consensus, in that case, is that it would also be *highly* fundamentally undervalued. Now, this is a bit of an ""if""... the plant has dealt with outages over the past year. There's a good recent post on WSB outlining all of this in better clarity than I can, if you just search for the ticker on here.

Frankly I am outsourcing some of my conviction here to the hedge funds who have bet hundreds of millions on this company, and were loyal to it even when it was 80% off of its highs. If they didn't sell and they have access to the plant, C-Suite executive team, etc., I think they have done their DD.

**Why has it come to this and why are days to cover so high?**

* Concerns about tech which, AFAICT, have abated ‚Äî the tech demonstrably seems to work
* Concerns about manufacturing capability ‚Äî these were certainly merited but things have gotten much better recently with real developments
* Several short reports e.g. from John Hempton who has had some good calls but has also gotten lots of ""revolutionary tech"" companies extremely wrong, e.g. being short on Tesla.
* Really, almost every despac company was indiscriminately shorted. If you work at a Pod Shop, you essentially run market neutral, so you *have* to short. This means that a ton of pods indirectly work together to short the same groups of stocks, which can lead to getting sloppy. It's also worth noting that because any individual short might only be, say, 2% of their book, they aren't really all that worried about climbing SI.

**How am I playing:**

As you can see below I entered today and am long in size.

https://preview.redd.it/rf0aih9a7red1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f81d656b82ddbab59d74e30559e083850aaa74b

**Risks:**

There are a ton of risks. My position here is maybe 20% undervaluation, 80% market dynamics. Markets can be unpredictable. However I would point out relative strength today as a standout.

*Disc: highly risky, might enter or exit at any time depending on how this trades. This company could easily go back down again. My thesis might not play out. Do your own DD!*",07-26-2024
"Let's compare $TSLA with $GMTesla has a market cap of $704B while GM has a market cap of $50B.

Tesla has a P/E ratio of 61.87 while GM has a P/E ratio of 4.96.

Yet, what do the books say?

GM has almost 2x the revenue of Tesla. Tesla missed its EPS targets by -16.15%. Meanwhile, GM exceeded EPS targets by 14.49%.

If that‚Äôs not enough, GM has a greater amount of assets and much more cash flow than Tesla. 

Despite this, based purely on market cap, Tesla is 14x more valuable than GM despite drastically less revenue, assets, and cash flow.

Now I‚Äôm not going to speculate on whether $TSLA or $GM are overvalued or undervalued. 

However, market sentiment is not consistent with what the financials of these companies tells us.",07-25-2024

*""...after it's already pumped""*? let's talk money...

Their MNO partners collectively service over 2.8billion people.

Lets assume we address 10% of those

Lets take $1 per month for ASTS per user

$3.36billion/year multiplied by whatever EBITDA multiple you want. We've gone conservative so far, why stop now, let's go x10? = $130 share price.

Those numbers only consider commercial cell coverage. ASTS already have military revenue, they already have interest from other goverment services.

I can sell you a more realistic number, but I'm giving you a shitty easily obtainable scenario. Come on, $1 per month per user??

btw, they have a projected EBITDA of 90-98%. You can't even get that EBITDA selling cocaine.

"Why I'm playing TSLA puts todayGuys, we have an insane earnings week and I just wanted to put in my two cents for TSLA today. 

Here‚Äôs what they're expecting:

* Earnings per share: 62 cents expected

* Revenue: $24.77 billion expected

Just for comparison:  A year ago, Tesla reported 91 cents of EPS and sales of $24.9 billion. First and formost, I'm getting a put spread. Not puts. IV is just way too high for just puts. Spreads reduce the IV and focuses more on the underlying. But why puts? The stock actually PUMPED hard last earnings. Well, let me explain. 

Lower sales volume and vehicle prices are behind the expected decline. Tesla delivered about 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter at an average realized price of $42,500. A year ago, the company shipped about 466,000 vehicles at an average price of about $44,000.

There's really no indicators telling me that they're doing better as a constant decline in sales will probably continue well into 2025. Just look at the headlines. Musk's cybertruck is a complete failure. The tesla semi is a dud. The tesla roaster isn't out and will never be out. And his other projects? Hyperloop, solar panel shingles? All busts. 

Yea I'm expecting a >10% drop today. TSLA 7/26 240p is just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so this is why I'm getting the spread. Buying the 240p while selling the 225p (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 477 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if TSLA drops as much as I expect today, this spread should profit over 3x. Good luck!",07-23-2024

"Trading on Stock SplitsLike trading on earnings reports, I'm sure this is a small step up from gambling. But thats kinda the thing around here. 

Nevertheless it's a sign a business is doing well and numbers I've seen is on average stocks go up 25-30% over the year after a split.

So I bought AVGO pre-split, I have MSTR which splits Aug 7th. I am grabbing SONY which splits in October. But the real value appears to be in holding it before they announce the split as lines go vertical upon announcements.

  
Questions:

1. How regarded of a strategy is to try to play? Do any of these stocks get killed after splitting (I did see this happened to Tesla but the rules do not apply to them)

2. Are there any reliable calendars for upcoming splits you use?

"What's the take on AAPL's future given Trump victory, Tariffs and Elon gaining more powerWhat do you think will happen to AAPL?  
I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks? Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple's future?",11-07-2024
"Need help regarding intrinsic value So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it‚Äôs finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham‚Äôs valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

A- Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV

B- Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value ($81 would be the average), but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether 

Edit- Please offer your advice, I am trying my best to learn and would be handy to see what other people do in this situation ",11-01-2024

But I had several realizations as I‚Äôve been continuously studying investing.

1. I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING! $50 here and there into the companies I named is BS. I learned just because a company is in the news often doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they have good financials (they turn a profit, steady growth, etc) 

2. NO STRUCTURE: $50 here and there is NO structure what so ever.

I want investing to be apart of my monthly budget and I‚Äôm serious about that expense just like I am my rent / car note. 

3. NO STRUCTURE (Continued): there‚Äôs no portfolio management, I don‚Äôt have a solid investment strategy.

"1 Is there a process by which info about a stock goes from insider knowledge to widespread knowledge, and how that relates to bubbles?Warren Buffet once said something like 'be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy'

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

"Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI EraWhenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",07-03-2024
"Diversify once you hit a gain % threshold?Hey everyone, I‚Äôm 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I‚Äôve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it‚Äôs around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight.

"Selling NVDA with $1m gainsI‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I‚Äôve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I‚Äôm sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I‚Äôm a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I‚Äôm also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can‚Äôt really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.

"Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!)I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

"Musk/Tesla Insider trading question\*\*I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn't give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry.

Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.

I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?

Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?

The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I‚Äôm still well within the ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôm just lucky‚Äô phase since it‚Äôs only been a couple years, but I‚Äôve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past:¬†

1. Insight¬†
2. Conviction¬†
3. Patience

**Insight**

I‚Äôve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).¬†

Ben Graham‚Äôs quote rings true:¬†

>‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.‚Äù

Perhaps counterintuitively, I‚Äôve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.¬†

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.¬†

# Math

In 2023 I also started¬†practicing math daily¬†(243 days straight¬†as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I‚Äôd done any meaningful math.¬†

I‚Äôm not sure how much, but it¬†*feels*¬†like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.¬†

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.¬†

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.¬†

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I‚Äôve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I‚Äôm happy I did.¬†

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.¬†

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,¬†you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I‚Äôm much more patient in my investing these days and don‚Äôt react to the day-to-day.¬†

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",06-03-2024
"How, and what are the best way to financially analyze growth companies? Hey folks! I have a question‚Äîhow to analyze a growth company.
For example. How should we approach fundamentally, with companies that are literally creating the market (Apple back in the day, AirBnB, Coinbase, Tesla)? Or, rapidly expanding the market (NVIDIA with ai chips, energy companies that are investing in nuclear power plants). 
‚Äî
In mature companies, it‚Äôs easy for us to value invest. But, growth investing..? I tried finding some things online but no luck yet.
‚Äî
I am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example. If someone works in the energy industry, and understand the high energy demand of data centers, and also understands how nuclear can provide such demand‚Äîthen I guess that would be it.

"NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV MarketInvesting in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

"Are EVs a bad investment right now?The EV industry, previously recognized as an area of growth and technological advancement, now appears to be under considerable pressure. Recent developments reveal a general downturn across the sector, with Tesla, one of many players, implementing significant job cuts. The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.

Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

"What if self driving takes over?Hey,

- TSLA : will may be in the top 10; actually they‚Äôre selling the self driving as a subscription of 99$ monthly, what if every Tesla owner have this feature?

"Is it easy to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù now?Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?

We‚Äôve all heard the mantra ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never beat the market‚Äù but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?

I‚Äôve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it‚Äôs significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I‚Äôve always been higher‚Ä¶for over a decade now. 

So hear me out, I‚Äôve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  

With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I‚Äôve found this sector completely destroys the overall ‚Äúmarket.‚Äù Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it‚Äôs very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  

The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I‚Äôve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I‚Äôm still beating the NASDAQ too.  

The contrarian‚Äôs argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I‚Äôm up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don‚Äôt see how the whole world economy wouldn‚Äôt fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  

I‚Äôm not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I‚Äôm just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I‚Äôm doing?  

Is there a point where the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that‚Äôs the real underlying answer to my question.  ",04-03-2024
"Frustrated with the amount of scammers in the financial spaceHello,

It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn't strictly true, but man the scammers are everywhere.

I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week, and even when I searched for terms like ""financial scam"" or ""financial fraud"" or whatever the exact terms I used, I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading, who was going to warm me of frauds!

I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried, and I said to myself, 60 minutes won't scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck??

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.

I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it's running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all!

Don't get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It's scams all the way down!",03-31-2024

"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too lateOnce a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report  
March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Mar√≠n Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestl√©, L'Or√©al, LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.  
The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.  
Worth the ride, until...  
But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.  
Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.  
When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  
On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  
All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

The bet on Tesla to be a robotics leader is the biggest gamble however they need to do something to justify their tech valuation because at the moment their primary source of profit stems from automobiles and as opposed to previous predictions they will not have a monopoly over this industry when the EV revolution is realized.

"Is China set for ""finally"" bottom and an epic rally?DISCLAIMER: This post can disturb US readers:

  
What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions
* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei

China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist, but won't cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side - we are sorrounded by fake news, extreme division, teenagers suicide rate very high, adults depressed and anxiety, etc...

That story is over - I believe China is set to rally and this is the bottom (you read it here first). Recent news signalling this:

"NVIDIA - 2023 Q4 earnings projections[The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook):

*Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  


***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    


**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*‚ÄúBy the end of this year, we‚Äôre going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.‚Äù*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  
Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   


The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.   


**\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.

&#x200B;

***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***   
   
[*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)  
However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.    


However, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.   


100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.   
[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).    
A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.     
2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.   
Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.   
No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.

  
Last note,

the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.

"Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause. 

> These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?

> Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.

> Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?

> Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.",01-20-2024

"20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 yearsHello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments. 

1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment 
2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?",01-18-2024
"Apple and Tesla may no longer be ‚Äòsafe investments‚Äô as China‚Äôs troubles grow**From Marketwatch:**

China is also in the midst of population woes and a stagnating economy. With US sanctions fears adding fuel. 

**From Barrons:**

> We expect the sequential growth momentum of the Chinese economy to stabilize at a subdued level over the course of 2024, with annual growth slowing to 4.4% in 2024 as the reopening effects fade, the property sector remains a drag, and government policies focus on containing downside risks rather than providing a major growth boost,‚Äù wrote Julius Baer economist Sophie Altermatt in a research note on Wednesday.

"What industries are you most bullish on this year? Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?I‚Äôm paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track & trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.  
The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).

  
EV‚Äôs are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There‚Äôs not much to compare it with and no, it hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù.

  
Also, let‚Äôs not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We‚Äôre seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).  
I‚Äôm currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:  
$ALB - My safety net play  
One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).

  
$LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play  
One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I‚Äôve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company/stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource. (Lithium carbonate equivalent). For context, anything worth 1million tonnes is likely to attract major institutional capital.

"Tesla stock grab ultimatumI just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is (practically) demanding he have his voting power **doubled** in the company. This after he sold huge chunks, such as to finance buying Twitter. 

>  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company‚Äôs stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.

> ‚ÄúI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can‚Äôt be overturned,‚Äù Musk wrote in a post on X. ‚ÄúUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.‚Äù

So the 2nd block he‚Äôs essentially threatening to spin off and make competition. 

But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?

Is this some insider key to the sell off they‚Äôve been experiencing? Cuz it‚Äôs frankly scary to me. And it‚Äôs scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company.

"Navigating the Electric Vehicle Landscape as a New InvestorHey fellow investors!  
  
I'm a relatively new investor, particularly focussing on long term investments. I spent most of 2023 learning the ropes of valuing companies and now I'm eager to explore a specific industry.  
  
Lately, I've been drawn to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. While it's tempting to dream of picking the next Tesla, I'm mindful that savvy investors often analyze historical data, seeking common trends that make sense as the sector matures. This includes looking at the miners of essential metals, as well as the hardware and technology necessary for battery production.

"Some positive re-encouragement needed feels like I've got (fomo) With stocks ripping to new highs. BTC on the brink of 100K I just feel like threw an opportunity to be financially free.

But then if I reinvest. I'm probably subjecting myself to a possible downside of a crash and considering how high major stocks are such as $Tesla $Btc, $Mstr, $Hood  just to name a few. I just don't know what the play is anymore. I'm at a total loss mindset.

"RKLBI've been buying RKLB since it was worth around 11 dollars. I currently have around 500 dollars of RKLB and 600 dollars of VOO in my portfolio. Is it worth getting RKLB and selling VOO? I believe RKLB has loads of potential and that the stock will shoot up as soon as they get a successful Neutron launch out of the way. Also, despite what some are fearing, I doubt Elon would interfere in RKLB's business. Neutron is not a F9 competitor for now and until they can get their cadence up, it won't even be. A Trump presidency does not seem like that much of a risk. Especially with Elon fighting for things like deregulation, which will help everyone including RKLB. I do understand going all in on a single company stock like RKLB is very risky, but if things do pan out, this will be like buying Tesla in the early 2010s.

"RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

"Why Donald Trump‚Äôs Return Could Boost Demand for Robots ‚Äì A Long-Term Investment OpportunityHey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there‚Äôs more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap‚Äîand robots could be the answer.

That‚Äôs where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let‚Äôs talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they‚Äôve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we‚Äôre talking about. RR‚Äôs service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they‚Äôre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn‚Äôt just conceptual‚Äîit‚Äôs been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there‚Äôs Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we‚Äôre after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",11-06-2024
"Educate me about stock So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it).

"Tesla Soars to Best Day in 11 Years After a Blowout Quarter> Tesla Inc.‚Äôs shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.

"Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental creditsTesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts‚Äô forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla‚Äôs growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

"Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google‚Äôs self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that‚Äôs over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google‚Äôs search business is under threat, it‚Äôs important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises? What am I not understanding and missing here?",10-11-2024

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter
Tesla‚Äôs stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla‚Äôs growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.

In the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla‚Äôs lead remains substantial.

Tesla‚Äôs 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.

Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company‚Äôs upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.

"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and AtlantaUber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips‚Äîexclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo‚Äôs co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

The competition in the self-driving space is heating up, and Uber's latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

"Opportunity In OracleI‚Äôve been hearing how oracle expects 9% revenue growth for FY 25 they also said for Q3 and Q4 24 they had signed their largest contracts to date. 

I‚Äôve also heard examples of how‚Äôd they‚Äôd apply their tech. One example tied to the medical industry. Say a doctor wanted to pull up past CT scans, MRIs, or other tests when meeting with a patient they can voice request these from Oracles database. Hospital,  physician offices, and dentists offices at least in my area always feel like they have some of the most outdated data systems I‚Äôve ever seen. Whether or not hospital managers feel like forking out money to upgrade is another question, but if they were to upgrade to something this feels like it would actually improve efficiency.

I‚Äôve heard from Oracle execs before around integration of AI in automating some data pulls. It seems like something that‚Äôs been on their radar for years. To me this seems like a value offering of their DBMS and their cloud Services. 

I‚Äôm a little skeptical on near term feasibility of the more complex things Oracle claims on automated analyses. In practice there‚Äôs so much nuance to data that I wouldn‚Äôt currently trust this to handle complex questions that require strategic thinking and business knowledge. So personally I don‚Äôt buy claims around complex analyses anytime soon. 

One other thing was Oracle is also quite literally designing data centers that would be powered by SMRs in addition to expanding their existing data center footprints. SMRs historically have been quite expensive to install, but curious to see if there are long term cost savings by doing this. 

It seems like they have a feasible vision for how the products can be used everyday and commercialized. On one hand you have companies like Tesla promising C-3PO and on the other hand companies like Oracle are promising something that feels much closer and real, with practical use cases.

What are other things you think might drive value or detract value to Oracle in the future. Do you think it‚Äôs overvalued (if so why?)? 

Also, did anyone have any interesting reads around this to share? Trying to learn more about their business plan. ",09-12-2024

"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robotsRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since MayWaymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

"Tesla Stops Taking Orders For Its Least Expensive Cybertruck ($61K), Cheapest Cybertruck Now Costs $99,990 Tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry-level Cybertruck, which was originally priced at $61,000, leaving the $100,000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. This move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by CEO Elon Musk, who in 2019 projected that the Cybertruck would cost around $40,000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. Now, the least expensive model available is the dual-motor Foundation series, which is priced at $99,990 and offers a 318-mile range. This model is available for delivery as soon as this month, while the higher-end $119,990 tri-motor Cyberbeast, which has a 301-mile range, is expected to be delivered starting in October.

Despite Musk's earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations, some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected, especially for the higher-priced models. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, noted that this latest move ""shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks,"" particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option.

Tesla's shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability, even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. The Cybertruck, with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the ""Blade Runner"" movie and its stainless-steel body, has certainly captured the imagination of many, but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some.

Sales figures show that Tesla sold nearly 4,800 Cybertrucks in July, marking its best month yet and making it the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. priced over $100,000. However, maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. A spokesperson for Cox Automotive commented that while Tesla has sold more than 16,000 units so far, ""sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge,"" reflecting the potential difficulty Tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup.

The Cybertruck‚Äôs journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges, with deliveries only beginning in November 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp-up. With the latest pricing strategy, Tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high-end models to carry the day, but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen.

"Possible Bullish Thesis on HertzI know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

What are your thoughts?  
Do you see value in this thesis?  
Do you have a strong counter argument?

Looking forward to your thoughts. Thanks!",08-06-2024

"How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investmentüí∏Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes.

If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more.

However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well.

One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle...

https://preview.redd.it/lyt5r3kmn3cd1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe179e72d777caf49e6d8c0e66ec800f6f39d34a

Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors?

Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow.

This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.

James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get.

Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport.

I believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does).

I've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla.

Tesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too...

https://preview.redd.it/pnc5gnmsn3cd1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba5c2e8b2be1dcdd27e20bc81f604e2f627b7beb

When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government.

Seeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now.

"Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian (RIVN)Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian (RIVN)

Roughly 2 years ago I saw my first Rivian truck in the wild in my local suburbs of Cincinnati‚Ä¶ since then I‚Äôve seemingly seen more and more every month. 

Is this is similar trend in other cities in the US? - if so does this mean Rivian may be a worthy investment? ‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt researched the company much but feel like this is a trend worth noting that has me interested in investing. 

So I ask : is this reason enough to invest in Rivian? Could its business model follow the footsteps of Tesla (or even come remotely close?) at $15 a share I‚Äôm beginning to get FOMO and asking myself ‚Äúwhy not buy 100 shares and see what happens?‚Äù 

Do any of you own Rivian stock? If you had $1500 buying power to spare in a $60k portfolio would you take a risk on Rivian? If not what would you buy instead?

"RIVN: To Buy or Not to Buy? A Comprehensive AnalysisThere's been a lot of discussion about Rivian (RIVN) lately, with opinions split between supporters and skeptics. Some are even comparing RIVN to Tesla, with analyst Gary Black suggesting ""RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019."" Let's break down the pros and cons of RIVN as we know them:

# Positive Factors

The main factor is Volkswagen's recent $5B investment, which has significantly extended the liquidity runway.

[Data by The Asian Investor, seekingalpha.com](https://preview.redd.it/yaykx1avd59d1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea76e2e72d388f4e794ba64a8eadeb11da8f97ee)

**Additional key considerations:**

1. Strong balance sheet with $7.9B cash/investments as of Q1 2024
2. New factory in progress + tax incentives for existing facility
3. Positive sentiment around trucks and vans, with super loyal fanbase
4. R&D in Serbia, reducing costs
5. Shifting to base platform + add-ons model
6. New R2 model has more reservations than total yearly production
7. Potential for expanded partnerships.
8. Expected gross profit by year-end could boost stock to $20-25 range

Thanks to u/bluecap for additional insights from previous discussion.

# Challenges

Declining cash balance and high cash burn rate during production ramp-up since FY 2022 is a main risk.

[RIVN Cash and Short Term investments, takeprofit.com](https://preview.redd.it/dj9jdw6yd59d1.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb6a6813e1d3d7941e1835d5639766028a1af9f)

Competition from established automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers is important to consider as the market becomes increasingly competitive.

* Current P/S ratio of 1.8x, below 3-year average of 3.0x
* Average 12-month price target from 23 analysts: **$14.52** (range $8-$21)

# Technical Analysis

[Chart and analysis by takeprofit.com\/@mustermann84](https://preview.redd.it/7nc6yyt3e59d1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc8530008238aa27c0566f25c1875b06e5b5bded)

* Weekly chart indicates a possible trend reversal (depicted as a ""Black Swan"" pattern resembling a head and shoulders formation)
* Possible interim price targets in identified cluster zones
* MACD indicates a potential long-term reversal 

# Conclusion

Rivian's profile has improved significantly, addressing previous concerns. The Volkswagen investment is a game-changer for risk mitigation. However, cash burn remains a concern, with negative free cash flow of $1.5B in Q1 2024. The new investment extends the runway to 8-9 quarters, reducing immediate financial pressure.

I will closely monitor Rivian's performance and how it handles challenges, especially from Chinese rivals.

"Rivian / The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern.# Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive?

# The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation.

# 

¬†There is a so-called Black Swan pattern, which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal.¬†The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements.

* The smaller Fibonacci is the so-called conservative retracement.
* ¬†The longer-term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement.

For the technical analyst, the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible (interim) price targets. In this context, the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy, structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart.¬†

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?

"Fear that I've already missed out (the opposite of FOMO)?I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think ""heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then, rather than buying in with that realization, I talk myself out of it. ""How much more can it really go up?"" I don't know... Examples: Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I've since watch both explode and its like ""damn! why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies?"" Those are the most obvious misses I've made.

I'm curious how you determine when you've missed your opportunity. I'm not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don't care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn't think most companies were a safe long-term bet. But, there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn't have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity, I'm like ""is now the best time to buy? Its already doubled since I was ready to enter."" 

I'm currently don't have much liquidity so I'm not buying. But, by the end of the year, I should have $20-30k freed up. And, if some of the stocks I'm currently interested in go up, I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere ""safer."" Besides the argument that over an x number of years, almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you've missed out.",06-12-2024

"Are You Proud of the Companies You Invest In?Hey!

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",05-26-2024

"BYD Company (Chinese Stock) 

**BYD Company Stock (Chinese Stock)**

**My Thesis:**

BYD is unknown, undervalued and currently growing at a very aggressive rate and has a lot of future potential to do well.

In 2023 Q4, BYD overtook Tesla in the number of EV sales (526000 BYD to 484000 Tesla) meaning it became the number one EV player in the market. At the rate BYD is growing at, they will be a dominant force in the market in the years to come when cars transition to electric.

However there are many risks associated with a new, upcoming car brand in the industry of automotives particularly as it is a Chinese company. 

**Pros of BYD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4uygiuo47mc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b5e265ae4b72a5f6ee754ca9adafef3825dca7

**BYD** as a whole is growing at a very aggressive rate from almost doubling its revenue from 2021 to 2022. As it looks to expand into new horizons, there is more potential for growth as it taps into Europe, Southeast Asia, Mexico and Brazil where they have only begun rolling out their EVs in 2022/2023.

Strong balance sheet

Cash 51,471 Billion CNY

Debt (Current 11,618 + Long Term 10,211) =  21,829 Billion CNY

Cash is double debt

From 2020 - 2022 BYD has been free cash flow positive.

BYD is undervalued compared to Tesla (28/2/24) at time of writing

**BYD Ratios**

PS 0.92

PB 4.09

P/E 18.64

EV/EBITDA 12.55

**Tesla Ratios**

PS 6.56

PB 10.14

P/E 46.9 

EV/EBITDA 41.24 

Vertical Integration allows BYD to keep EVs at an affordable price to help maximize its sales. Instead of purchasing parts/components from external companies, BYD makes most of its components by itself e.g. batteries, IGBT transistors (2 of the most expensive parts) and electronic components. The only parts BYD reported that they don‚Äôt make are the windows and tires.

BYD is heavily supported by the Chinese government through subsidies to help lower costs for them which allows BYD cars to be sold at a very affordable cost for consumers particularly in the Asian markets.

**Challenges + Risks** 

BYD is relatively unknown in the automobile industry and tapping into developed markets like Germany, Japan and America will be very difficult. There will be challenges in convincing consumers to transition from well-known brands with much longer history such as Toyota and Volkswagen etc... This is particularly true with the skepticism surrounding EVs and Chinese companies in general.

BYD experienced this issue when they tried to sell their electric bus fleets in North America back in 2015. However, through successful marketing and branding strategies BYD managed to win consumers and now 50% of electric buses are from BYD. There is a big question whether BYD is able to market strategically and convince the public of its electric cars.

Heavy tariffs placed on BYD in Europe/America will severely cut BYD‚Äôs margins where we are seeing 25% tariffs in the likes of America combined with the difficulty of marketing their EVs to the public. This is due to the ‚Äúunfair playing advantages‚Äù BYD has had from Chinese government subsidies. [EU anti-subsidy probe into electric vehicle imports from China | Think Tank | European Parliament (europa.eu)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2023)754553#:~:text=On%204%20October%202023%2C%20the,vehicles%20(BEVs)%20from%20China.) There is also a question of what will happen in the future if the Chinese government reduces the subsidies it is giving to BYD.

Currently most of BYD‚Äôs revenue is from China so there are risks associated with how the Chinese economy does. But BYD is looking to diversify by expanding globally as mentioned previously.

One of the biggest risks is the ‚ÄúChina Risk‚Äù. We have seen crackdowns in large Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent due to their market dominance, unfair competition and fraudulent practices. As a result we have seen Chinese stocks plummeting down and losing a lot of value in recent years. Whether BYD will be a target of this when they grow further in the future is a red flag for many investors.

There has been a recent announcement by Biden that Chinese EVs will be banned in America due to safety issues and it is possible that European countries may follow in the footsteps of America and the bans could spread to the developed Western countries (Australia, Canada, Western Europe) etc. This is certainly a big risk to BYD's opportunity to expand into the Western markets as they have just recently set up new bases in the likes of Germany and Australia. Future revenues will take a big hit and earnings potentials will be seriously limited if this is the case. The geopolitical tensions between the West and China is a major risk factor we have to account for.

**Summary**

In conclusion, BYD presents an interesting investment opportunity. The company has demonstrated impressive growth, overtaking Tesla in EV sales and expanding into new markets. Its strong balance sheet, positive free cash flow, and undervaluation compared to Tesla suggest potential for significant upside. Vertical integration and government subsidies have allowed BYD to keep prices competitive and penetrate markets effectively. While there are challenges, such as tapping into developed markets and navigating tariffs, BYD has shown resilience and adaptability in the past. The company's efforts to diversify its revenue streams and expand globally mitigate risks associated with its reliance on the Chinese market. Recent announcements of potential bans in Western countries could pose a significant threat to BYD‚Äôs expansion plans. While the ""China Risk"" is a concern, BYD's track record and strategic positioning make it a promising stock for investors looking to capitalize on the growing EV market and the transition to electric vehicles particularly in the developing countries.

**My Take:**

Yes we have seen the large crackdown on big tech stocks in China. However, BYD works closely with the government and is supported through subsidies, incentives and government support so it is in BYD's interest to follow CCP's policies and regulations. China recognizes that they are facing a global warming crisis and are transitioning to ""clean up"" their country through switching to EVs so it is in the CCP's interest to work with BYD. The world is larger than America/Europe and there is a huge market in the developing nations. I recognize that there are many risks in investing in BYD but for the valuation it is currently at, I believe it is undervalued and there is significant potential in the years to come. ",03-03-2024

"When to sell - stocks under waterI have a decent portfolio and am working toward being more involved rather than just letting stuff sit.

I use Fidelity and look at the guidance that they have for the research. For the most part I am seeing that I should probably just sell 3M and Tesla but might want to hold on to Boeing as they have some potential large orders in negotiations. Tesla looks like it is going to stick until late 2025.

When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies, do you go off what they say with their research tools? If not, how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers? Better to take a loss and hope to make it up with a stronger stock? Do you utilize the investment companies to provide individualized guidance? Is that worth it?

When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.

This huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  ""sunk cost fallacy"" trap. Which states: ""It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.""  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The ""sunk cost fallacy"" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.

**Points to consider:**

It is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as ""turning the corner"", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.

1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the ""treadmill for the rich"" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new ""video game"" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun).
2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the ""household"" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is
3. **""Great product not a great stock""** \- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow ""separate"" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks ""great""., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant ""moats"" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.

I would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.

- Deliveries +20% YoY to 485k‚úÖ

Overall, #expectations from #analysts were narrowly missed, yet the long-term perspective for #Tesla remains exceptionally attractive. AI and robotics will increasingly come into focus.

#Sales
Vehicle deliveries increased from 405,278 to 484,507, a 20% rise from Q4-2022 to Q4-2023. Elon Musk hinted in the conference call that Tesla's FY24 Volume growth ""may be notably lower.""

#Revenue
Increased from $24.32 bn. to $25.2 bn. - a moderate growth of 3.6%. Despite increased deliveries, lower prices per vehicle & an unfavorable model mix (more lower-priced models) dampened the revenue increase.

#Margin
Declined from 16% to 8.2% - here the price reductions & higher production costs due to the Cybertruck are evident. Operating income fell from $3.89 bn. to $2.06 bn. Another positive note is the increase in EBIT margin compared to Q3-2023 at 7.6% - the bottom has been passed!

#EPS (Adjusted)
This fell from $1.19 to $0.71, a 40% decrease. Despite a one-time tax benefit of $1.56 per share (or $5.9 bn.), the decline in profitability metrics could not be offset.

#FreeCashflow & #Cash
Jumped from $1.42 bn. to $2.06 bn. (+45%). As a result, the cash balance increased from $22.2 bn. to $29.1 bn. (+31%). This demonstrates Tesla's ability to efficiently generate and utilize capital - even in challenging times!

#Guidance
Despite the solid figures, the guidance for 2024 remains cautious. Expected lower growth rates in vehicle volume could cool growth, while the focus is on the next generation of vehicles (Model 2/A in 2025 for $25,000).",01-25-2024
"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541

Data Sources:

* SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã
* SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)

**Key Observations:**

* Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA.
* Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY.
* Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.

It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.

I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:

1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market.
2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy.
3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results.
4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy.
5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform.
6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.

It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Nikola (NKLA) thoughts?The expert evaluation is technically Hold, understandably so.  To me it looks like a cheap penny stock to maybe explode in a few years. Company was worth 80$ per share in 2020, although based on lies the company told their investors, which he‚Äôs doing 4 year time in prison for now.  But to see the gains like that, and where they‚Äôre at now, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to throw 5 grand at it now .80cents per share, to potentially be  $40,000 in a few year if they get back to where they were ? 

The company did develop and sell 35 hydrogen powered electric heavy trucks last year, the first of their rollout.  Those trucks do currently have a recall that they‚Äôre fixing. 

Given the scandal years ago , and the mechanical troubles now I definitely feel the apprehension, but the company is resilient and considered by some to be in a hiccups stage, potentially rising to a Tesla of the workforce so to speak someday.

"Tesla: How about its inventory level?A lot of posts are talking about Tesla's production and deliveries in 2023, thus would like to look into the numbers from another perspective.

# INVENTORY

https://preview.redd.it/omsupf0ar1ac1.jpg?width=424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2309e6cfc9f615286d06e98ab7bb200c91aa9c13

When we look at the production and deliveries numbers between 2021 and 2023, it is not difficult to identify that the aggregate production is larger than the aggregate deliveries \[note: -5,750 for FY2021, +55,760 for FY2022 and +37,404 for FY2023\].

With the fierce competition observed in the market (lead to price slash and hence decline in gross profit margin) as well as the loss of tax credit / green benefits in 2024 (lead to possible lower demand for some of its core products), wonder if inventory will become a problem for the company in future.

"Living off CC ETF - real life experimentHi! 

I personally don't see many people doing post about portfolio in a drawdown phrase, most seems to be in an accumulation phrase. So I thought I'd make one! It's my first time making post like this, so please feel free to critique or advise me on what you would like to know or see.  
  
I'm in Canada, so the ticker is going to be a bit different. Unfortunately, I don't have access to low fee etf options with out incurring some withholding taxes, but I tried to be as efficient as possible.  
  
Here's the portfolio:

[StockEvent doesnt work too well with margin so i use excel for full summary](https://preview.redd.it/i7sh5j6hkqkd1.jpg?width=863&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e4f8b55e1980d1fafd856bf480e99bf1be67ced)

The general strategy on this portfolio are broken down to 3 parts.  
  
1. Core Holding - This portfolio is mainly in a tax advantage account. This account will focus more on longer term outlook. All the distribution will be funnel in to a passive index such as VFV (SP500) or XQQ (Nasdaq). The distribution in an extreme emergency can be used for living expense. The plan here is that if imagine starting at 0 and invest the amount provided by this account for 30 years with 6% real return, the portfolio should be worth 1.5m and we can just live off that if all else fails.   
  
2. Margin Fixed income - This portfolio is in my margin account. I made a plunge in Q3 last year to purchased a lot of preferred shares at the peak (or what I thought was the peak) of interest rates. My assumption is that PS should move similar to bond and peak interest rates should somewhat indicate bottom of these PS prices. As interest decrease, or even just an market sentiment of rate decreasing should gradually move these shares price up. Also, as rate decrease, margin rate should also follow suit.  
  
As the distribution is more secured than common shares dividends, I felt a bit more comfortable going in with some margin. The distribution for this portfolio is mainly used for paying down margin, but can be used as a living expense if needed.  
  
Why Brookfield? I specifically picked up mostly BPO which is property side of Brookfield. This includes a lot of offices building related assets which I feel was priced down unreasonably at the time with market believing that WFH is here to stay. These PS at the time was trading at 40$ of issued price, yielding over 12-15% at the time. Majority of them are rate resets type.  
  
The margin should be paid down in around 4-5 years; however, as the rate bottomed out or the shares prices are close to issued price I may off load these to pay down margin and redistributed to equity based funds.  
  
3. Living Expense - This portfolio is mainly focused on broader market covered call etf mainly SP500 and Nasdaq with an exception of YTSL which only hold tesla. All the distribution from this portfolio is going toward living expense. Anything saved will be moved to emergency cash pile to later be reinvest or spend accordingly  
  
So imagine the whole portfolio distribution to be like your work income. 25% of the income (core) is going toward saving for the future, 25% (margin) going toward paying down debt which is margin, and 50% (living) is going toward living expense.  
  
---  
I also have 6-12 months emergency funds. In the case that market tanked hard, we will switch to living off these while reinvest the distribution. As economic uncertainty is looming and I'm just taking a plunge into this for the first time, the first few months we might be extra careful with spending and see where to go from then.  
  
Potential risk  
Aside from concentration risk in Brookfield, tesla and Nvdia that can add volatility. The other area of risk I can see is that I'm extracting 12% of distribution entirely from LE portfolio, this could proved shaky in the long term. My vision here is that in a year or 2 as rate decreases, I can off load preferred shares portion and move it to equity which will help pad the LE portfolio and bring down the spend rate on LE portfolio.   
  
The worst worst case scenario that I'm not fully prepared for would be the event where simultaneously, market crashed and Brookfield also get massive hit to the point where liquidation is in question where bonds and PS are priced down significantly - I then get margin called and liquidated.  
  
---  
  
Currently, me and my partner are burned out from our work. We have no other income sources, so we are living off this portfolio and plan to be for a long while. Generally we do not have lavish life style, so our projected expense should be covered by the LE portion of the portfolio. but if extra expense comes up we can drawdown the cash pile or from Margin portfolio. I've been a long time lurker in this sub and I thought I'd document my journey.

"I want to increase my dividend yield. Any advice is welcomed.Hi everyone, I have been following the sub for a while and this is my first post.

I'm M26, **European investor**, which means I have limited access to US ETFs. I use IBKR.

I have started investing in growth assets at the end of 2019 (right before the covid crash, learned things the hard way).

I have slowly built my portfolio (image attached) over the years and I never really cared much about dividends. I also have around 40k $ in crypto.

However, recently, I decided to calculate my monthly dividend yield and it turns out I get around 100$ monthly in dividends. So now I really wanna start setting goals and hopefully reach first **500$ monthly** and later increase my goal.

I manage to save and invest 2000$ monthly. I was thinking about adding $VHYL to my portfolio.

Please help me build a more dividend aggressive strategy. I am not looking for a ready plan, but simply I'd like first to hear your opinions and feedback on my portfolio and then what you would do/change and how you would allocate the 2000$ monthly. Also, what apps or websites should I check out for tracking my dividends?

Thanks.

"ETFs are the wrong way to invest in BDCsGiven the recent outperformance of BDCs it is no wonder that interest is picking up.

So it is no surprise that more often than not when people discuss their holding MAIN shows up in the list.

Another trend that I have noticed is that people tend to bring over investment approaches that they are accustomed to from common equity stocks and attempt to apply it to to close ended investment funds like BDCs.

What little data that I bothered to Google seems to confirm my suspicion as BIZD (which is the de-facto only ETF in the space) has seen an uptick in its AUM.

https://preview.redd.it/msvd31kb1xoc1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=059e8a1d6545a5b1cd957a6c4cb3845e100cce30

Fund flows from the last year also show a growing interest.

https://preview.redd.it/cm7xdaeg1xoc1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15e02762a699260f70b7da28a859b707a5a78ed

So now to my point - ETFs are the wrong way to invest in BDCs (and more broadly CEFs) for the following reasons:

A BDC is not a single holding in the regular sense that a company like Tesla is a single company, they are by themselves a diversified fund of investments just like an ETF is a diversified fund of investments.  
A picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a graphic from MAIN's recent investor presentation:  


https://preview.redd.it/hx9n38k33xoc1.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&s=0560d574d4e5f7b5c6490f0d586f028c05b205e4

So buying a BDC ETF is like buying an ETF of ETFs, not to mention that you will be paying fees to the ETF and fees to the individual BDCs held within it.

Another reason to avoid CEF ETFs is that the standard way ETFs are weighted (by market cap) is simply not applicable and misleading in regards to CEFs (which BDCs are).

CEFs do not trade at their real value (their NAV), this is as a result of them being closed ended (having a static amount of shares), this is unlike open ended funds such as ETFs which trade at their NAV.

As a result, some BDCs will trade at a discount (in a sense they are ""cheap"" as you can buy a dollar of value for less than a dollar), and some with trade at a premium (expensive).

Once you understand that it is clear that the market cap of a BDC is not a valid indicator of its ""worth"", even though discount/premium ratios remain within certain ranges.

Moreover, the size of a lender is not a good indicator of its skill or track record. If I were to lend money to anyone who knocks on my door no questions asked I would definitely rack up a meaningful sum of debt owed - but does that make me a better investment that a prudent lender that would rather turn borrowers away?

Last but not least, ""diworsification"".  
Again, remember that BDCs are not your regular companies that fill popular indexes like the S&P500. There are trash funds run by fund managers that are lining their pockets on your expense.

Apple does not charge its investors a yearly fee, so even if management waste 10bil on a failed project causing their stock price to temporarily be suppressed an investor is better served by sitting tight and seeing things through.

The same cannot be said about CEFs, you are actively losing money by holding a loser by way of fees. And if the fund management has a bad track record there is no reason to expect them to magically turn things around.

The proof is in the pudding - the performance of BIZD leaves a lot to be desired.

Here is a comparison of BIZD against the BDCs that I am personally invested in (this list of BDCs is in no way a buy recommendation, these are simply the ones that I personally like):

[Comparison on a total return basis \(divs reinvested\)](https://preview.redd.it/jeepb0ds8xoc1.png?width=4014&format=png&auto=webp&s=6959d052387c4b0ca8edd2136ccebfdb04b1374d)

The income generated from holding BIZD is also not a strong selling point, and somehow managed to go down in 2023 which was an absolutely stellar year for BDC income generation:

https://preview.redd.it/ogciaqsy9xoc1.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=510cf469838098ad44d125c64b758f65470604ad

The full backtest can be found [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=35rs2ApIBmr7qVQkk5xCNj).

Doing due diligence on individual funds requires effort and time but if you want exposure to BDCs (and other such holdings) it is a requirement.

Before I sign off let me address the inevitable comment:

>But what about PBDC?

IMO, PBDC is not comparable to a buy&hold strategy as it actively trades BDCs based off of discounts/premiums - which is a valid strategy of and by itself but not the same strategy.

As for PBDC's performance, it is still very short lived but it already seems to be falling behind the buy&hold strategy

"JEPQ vs SCHD; noob here, why would anyone put money in SCHD?I am doing alright with my long-term investing so far, growing ok, decided to check out this sub with interest in growing some passive income over time as well. Been seeing MANY people suggesting or actually putting money in SCHD. Is it just the diversification factor? I have been looking and comparing and other than the unfortunate inclusion of TSLA in JEPQ I don't understand why anyone would invest in SCHD.

Plese forgive whatever I may be missing here (and please educate me?), I am totally new to the dividend stuff, and fairly new to investing in general.

What I am seeing is double to triple dividends with JEPQ (for the sake of argument let's call it 8.75 vs 3.5), and while I get there is very little history here and the two are relatively equally flat over the last couple years valuewise;  Consumer Discretionary has been a strong sector and is better held by JEPQ. So coupling that with the fact we are in the infancy of the AI era, doesn't that position JEPQ to blow SCHD out of the water in overall value over at least the next 10 years as well?

Even if SCHD recovers this year to alltime high we are talking 5% from where it is now right? I understand the fund goes way back compared to JEPQ, but if one takes into account that any progress made from 2014 was lost to 2020, really the gains start there right?

"Indecisive So long story short, I started with a 2K account. And have managed in 3 days to grow it to 2,600. 

I used to trade stocks, but given my confidence in reading the chart and my intuition, (I believe my eyes are seeing things I don‚Äôt see yet). 

I will do basic analytics, I‚Äôll low at the recent high and lows, I‚Äôll look at the overall trend and also see where that compares to the high and lows. I‚Äôll also use things in conjunction like the moving average, in my situation it‚Äôs always the 20 day. 

All In all I would say 90% of my trades are 7D expiration or else, if the stock price is $100, and I don‚Äôt see it moving ALOT I‚Äôll buy ITM strike of say $98. 

If it‚Äôs in what I see a heavy bullish trend, and it‚Äôs a high volatility stock I may do a OTM call for 103-104.

"Tesla: Upto 25% returns in next 15 monthsTesla [ticker: TSLA] is led by technologist billionaire Mr Elon Musk who is soon to get a plum position in the new incoming US administration.

The company has several models of EV Tesla and Cyber truck in the market.

Why do I consider Tesla as undervalued?

Tesla closed on November 8th at 321$, while the stock peaked in November, 2021 at 407$.

A 25% hike over 8th November closing comes only to 401$ which is very much achievable in nexy 15 months. 

Elon Musk in US administration will be able to influence/enact policies to shut out Chinese manufacturers while expanding its own markets in the North Americas.

Tesla is also about to roll out robo taxi service, and automatons in near future to diversify and augment its revenue stream.

Techonological break throughs at Space X are likely to rub off near future Tesla products which will help it to stand out of the (now crowding) EV manufacturers.

Chinese manufacturers may be able to mass produce cheap EVs but are unlikely to close the technological gap without access to latest AI chips.

Besides, North Americas, Tesla may also count China, EU, Middle East, India and SE Asia as its market with increasingly wealthy populace who are not shy in spending on quality automotives.

"TSLA Earnings After Hours: Exploring Butterfly Spreads with a 500% R/R Setup
As we approach TSLA's earnings report after today's market close, the options market is pricing in a +/- 16-point move based on implied volatility. While calendar spreads typically offer an opportunity to exploit volatility discrepancies, I've found the current setups less attractive due to suboptimal reward-to-risk (R/R) ratios, despite the 30-40 point IV skew.

Instead, I've turned my focus to butterfly spreads, which seem to present better opportunities in this high-volatility environment. Here's what I‚Äôve been screening for:

Expiration: This Friday's options
Breakeven Range: Minimum 10% between the breakeven points
Reward-to-Risk Ratio: At least 500% (5:1)
Front Leg Delta: 20-50 delta
Structure: 1/-2/1 butterfly (though variations like 1/-3/2 or Broken Wing Butterflies (BWB) could be explored, but that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this post)
Given TSLA's expected post-earnings movement, these butterfly setups can capture significant gains if the stock moves within the anticipated range. This strategy allows for tight risk control, and the favorable R/R ratio provides an interesting opportunity compared to other approaches like calendars, which, despite the IV skew, just don‚Äôt measure up this time around.

"Tesla: Hop bunny hopTesla stock has taken quite a beating since 30th Sept. Even the Robotaxi event has so far failed to elicit any excitement from the investors.

But not all is lost:

Tesla despite challenges from Chinese EV makers remains automobile of choice for quality conscious buyers.

Interest rate cuts makes it easier for new buyers to take a loan for purchase of Tesla.

Tesla earning call is on Wednesday [23rd Oct], where it is likely to meet sales & revenue expectations with a positive guidance for 2025.

How to play?

Buy upto 10% OTM Tesla calls [so if stock is at 220$ then buy a 240$ call] with 30-60 days expiry.

"High Reward-to-Risk Call Calendar Spreads for This Week‚Äôs Earnings ReportsI've put together some call calendar spreads for companies reporting earnings this week. The strategies shown in the attached images offer a minimum of a 800% reward-to-risk ratio (theoretical), making them some of the most cost-effective plays available.

These trades are designed to take advantage of the higher implied volatility (IV) typically seen in front-month options around earnings reports. This increased volatility often makes calendar spreads more affordable.

Naturally, after earnings are announced, IV tends to collapse, causing the value of these calendar spreads to decrease. As a result, one possible strategy is to close part of the position before the report and part afterward. These calendar spreads operate with a front delta between 20-40. Additionally, each option leg has a minimum volume of 10 today to filter out very illiquid options.

What are your news or idea sources?Where can we find upcoming company events? Like Tesla robotaxi show or OpenAI fund raiser events? I thought news papers will do it but they cover after the event.

"Company Event Screener?Good evening fellow traders,

I have coded a bot that automatically places trades based on IV pricing inefficiencies and probabilities calculated by the black-scholes model. The probabilities aspect of my bot is the most crucial, but they are typically only accurate if a company has nothing going on and is trading sideways. To combat this, I use a screener to filter out anything expiring within an earnings-call or ex-dividend date. 

This week one of the trades my bot took was on Uber. All seemed to be going well until Tesla shit the bed last night and I woke up to an 8% gain on Uber's stock this morning, which was far out of my spread. My strategy is mostly automated and I rarely research any of my positions, but I would still like to mitigate risks like these if it's possible.

I'm on the verge of attempting to code something that scans headlines to add upcoming events like this to my screener so I can filter out shitty trades like this, but before I do - does anyone know if something like this already exists? Like a calendar similar to an earnings calendar but contains company events like these relevant to an industry? Would save me a ton of hours.

Thanks",10-11-2024

"Right Structures For Right CompaniesSomething interesting noticed, if going to play lotto plays like far OTM calls/puts for earning's they need to have as little time on the clock as possible like buying the week of, or following week.

1. I looked at FDX $240 strike with 9/27, 10/04, and 10/11 dates.
2. Only 9/27 actually made money or 100% return, I wonder if 9/20 made money, prob would have to close first thing in morning or extrinsic value depletes within just hours.
3. This really makes me think playing earning's the best strategy for *picking direction* are debt spreads, or possibly even credit spreads if feeling okay with spread loss so prob not.
4. Debt spreads aiming to capture intrinsic value like FDX bto $280p sto $260p would've been $750 to $2800ish

Debt spreads are really powerful for the short term, longer timeframes and they get tied up too badly vs diagonals which are more effective because they're more flexible. 

There's a sweet spot between too volatile of a ticker, using a diagonal which will get blow through twice up and down before even expiration, so the volatility of the company matters greatly deciding which options structure to use!

**CONCLUSION**: Why use diagonals or slower trade on volatile ticker, when can run debt spreads capturing few trades which otherwise wouldn't have worked on slower safer companies. For example, CMG is great for diagonals imo, but Tesla would be great for debt spreads imo.",09-22-2024

He also recommended Tesla at $230 while selling calls on NVDA at $470 and telling everyone to unsubscribe from other YouTubers if they recommend NVDA.

"$4,000 Overnight Trading $TSLALast week, $TSLA had a major ""buy the rumor sell the news"" event after the positive China news, and right before the ""200 magnet"" was hit the bears have since been winning the battle. Looking at the 30 min chart, we can see 4 important details: 

1. Failed pushes (weak theme)
2. 179 Key Level
3. Lower Highs (textbook bearish)
4. Weaker than the SPY (not pictured)

Right now, we are in the midst of a strong market cycle, but $TSLA has been consistently weaker than the $SPY. Further, keep in mind TSLA traded higher on poor earnings AND Elon's news of slowing growth. Typically, trading against the market cycle is risky, but in this instance $TSLA was trading higher on thin air. See below for trade details:

* Entry: 1/2 size AM weakness near key level with plan to add on true Breakdown on volume or ""strength"" 
   * Added full size on ""strength"" with an average price of about $0.50
* Profit Target: Gap fill on 30 min (172)
* Risk: Failed Push reclaim (183), moved lower to 179 after Breakdown. 

For sizing, overnight trading with options can be tough because I can't exit, so I scaled with a size that I would feel comfortable with being worthless in the AM. The contracts don't always become worthless overnight, but I tell myself they will be for two reason: 

* If it happens, par for the course
* More importantly, I don't stare at the stock all night/morning and can save my emotional capacity for outside of trading. 

$TSLA opened with a large gap down a little past my 172 target, and I exited with an average price of about $2.45 for about a $4,000 gain.

IT is still not looking healthy and with a weak looking S&P I can see this continuing lower unless they can pull some magic rabbit out the hat.

At the beginning of the month we put in the the following targets‚Ä¶$152 with about 102 days to run and $103 with 133 days to run‚Ä¶I am going to refresh & run the $103 target scenario given that it was the 2023 low, to see what BB1 comes up with.

 buying this thing for around 94 cents INCLUDING costs would seem like a very reasonable punt although you may have to sit on it for a bit to truly monetize it

Now what that is showing is the value of a $10 wide put fly that has 116 days to expiration and is exactly $49.76 Out-the-money to show the true value of the current fly‚Ä¶.we achieve this by linear fitting the volatilities and strikes to get an exact daily value of that particular fly. In this instance it is in its 44th percentile so kinda fair value but not terrible. If you see the list BB1 still likes that 100/115 put spread too but I feel that I may have missed the boat on that as I can now only buy 37 spreads for my $1000 investment given the price increase from earlier this month.

Now I decided to go a little shorter term and had a look at potential trades with about a month to go. I DO NOT recommend swinging for a 0DTE option as they are basically a total punt and you may as well go to the racecourse. 25 days is reasonable for the market to digest and a trend to form.

I first calculate how many shares I can buy with my funding and get a share number.

Then I calculated the porfit I can get when Tesla stock price hits different values and the equation is

(Stock price - strike price) \* shares number.  

And hence I get a table (I didn't finish it) and for each target Tesla stock price I can get a best strike price.

For example if I think Tesla stock price will hit $300 2 years later then I should choose strike price $175 according to the chart. The more OTM options have bigger shares number but the (Stock price - strike price) is so small so the overall performance is worse.

Can I use this way to decide what strike price to buy if I decide to keep it until the last 3 months? (I don't have enough experience to manipulate it) 

Can I do it this way? Do I miss any important things? 

This is my biggest investment so far so I really need advice to avoid grave mistake. Thanks a lot

Hi all, 

What do you think about this trade? 

Selling Jul 24 TSLA 145 put for $625 premium. I don't mind owning 100 shares of TSLA @ 145 per share.

Any thoughts, comments, objections?

"The best strategy of using protective putI am very bullish on Tesla stock recently after I see the performance of FSD v12. Many says this is the chatgpt moment of FSD.  Hence I recently buy a lot of Tesla shares and even utilize margin loan (1.5 leverage, maximum 30% portfolio drawdown before liquidation).

However I have no idea how much time it actully needs for the software earning to scale up and finally makes an impact on Tesla's earning report. Before that the slow down of cars saleing and unexpected economic events can drag down the stock price and hence a risk of liquidation.

To avoid liquidation I am thinking of using protective put. There are two different strategies

**A:** buy puts with recent expiry date and roll it until the Street recognizes the impact of FSD (if that really happens)

**B:** buy put with remote expiry date and sell it after the Street recognize the impact of FSD (if that really happens)

which one is a better strategy? I am new to option and has no idea. I know there are many factors to consider like the greek letters but are there any general suggestions about this?

&#x200B;

**> inb4 why don't you buy leap call option instead**

To get profit from option you have to predict price as well as time. I have no idea when the FSD can have impact on financial data and balance out the negative factors like car sales slow down. I also have no idea about the price. Tesla's price is far more expensive than car producer and hence the FSD software n‚Äôshit has been priced in more or less. A leap call with strike price $180 expiry 2026 is like $65 and the breakeven price is around $255 per share. I'd rather keep the stock and I can always wait longer time until Elon achieves the plan.

What is the market maker's play here? Is there suspicion of a run-up past 250-270? Would this be a hedge, or some strategy to benefit from IV without that much price movement?

"Sell Now or Sell 2 Years OutOk so im having some trouble debating on what I want to do so. Hear me out.

I sold a CSP late last year on Tesla where I place it super deep in the money at 300 strike. My cost per basis drop to 267 per share. Which i collected a $3,300 in premium.  


Now I want to get rid of the 100 tesla share but not sure on how to do it. I come to two possible solution.

First, I can sell 100 shares at the 100 cover call strike that exp on Feb 23, 2024 and collect $9,954 in premium. This will off set my loss of $6,820 at which point telsa is trading at 200 per share. 

\*\*\*I understand that by doing this, the person whos buying my contract at 100 per share, can openly sell those 100 shares to the open market at over $200+ per share, which will double his return. Where he can recover his $10,000 he paid me + $10,000 in profit. I will gain about  about $3,000 or so. By doing this the contract will probably be called away quickly.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Second scenario, If I sell this cover call 2years out to Jan 16, 2026 at $5 strike. I can possible collect $19,519 in premium. \*\*\*I understand  that by doing this, the person whos buying my contract at $5 per share can open sell it to the open market in 2year time, can make over $5+, which amount that is is unknown. So if tesla is trading at 300 in 2 years, they'll make $30,000. Which they will earn 3x what they paid for. But by doing this, I'll make them wait 2 years before they can close out or let it expire.\*\*\*

"Good sources of information more important than understanding technical analysis??Hello, I have been trading options for years now and I still don‚Äôt know what I am doing. We all agree that trading options is gambling. But also I realized that nowadays I spend more time doing research on Reddit or talking on online groups than doing actual technical analysis. 

Most of my trades are %50 based on experience on how I know the stock has performed in the past (just fast glance without drawing lines or anything) and %50 based on what my friends on discord/reddit trade or have read and share. I keep track of all my trades and surprisingly without doing any kind of analysis I am still earning about $1000/month on average. I know it is not much but the simple fact that I am positive just by doing trades talking to people surprises me.

So I wanted to know the opinion of other traders on this. Do you do technical analysis? Which resources do you use to make your trades (which online platforms and groups do you use)?

Also I noticed that most of my groups people always trade the same options (NVIDIA, TESLA, MICRO-STRATEGY, SYP‚Ä¶) Which are the stocks you trade the most?",02-14-2024
"5x bagger. Missted a 7x bag. Is this the way of r/options or should I save this from wallstreetbets?Not Financial Adivce. High conviction play. My Reasoning.

1x Tesla is currently a horrendous value play in the short term to medium term due to speculative long term growth catalysts.

2. Tesla was expected to grow 50% over year next year.

3x Cars overpriced as shit compared to increasingly similar market counterparts. Hyundai Ioniq and Ford get similar milage

4x) Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected 15% growth in revenue. Possible

5x) Other cars are expected, to grow fast in self driving.

6) Used cars saturating market.

7)Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.

"option trades for Tesla 

So here we are again‚Ä¶.everyone‚Äôs favorite trading stock Tesla has its quarterly earnings. Now while our system does not give you a direction, it will tell you the best option trade based on your view. Up/down, vol up or vol down..I can show you what to do. 

¬†Looking at the chart, while I could easily see a push-up to the trendline at around $222, but it still looks like the overall trend is bearish.

[chart doesn't look that great](https://preview.redd.it/2fcnlgnfqaec1.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=c670023e8525145d9a888f969288c2b3c69e58d2)

So to represent this (a short term move up followed by a rejection and move lower) I am running a very short-term upside¬† play, with a more medium-term downside one.

My upside trade is targeting the following;

Out of the list I chose the 215/222.5/230 call fly  90 times(contracts)... at around 94 cents its not a bad upside punt, just bear in mind that this is a 3 day option...either you'll be laughing or it will be a total loss..this would be the P&L of that trade...

 The downside trade is looking our¬† days from now, give or take ( our system will not specify an exact point unless you ask it to, because in the real world that rarely happens) with a target RANGE of $170 to $180

# Tesla Stock Pops After Report Trump Wants To Relax U.S. Self-Driving Rules

Tesla stock zoomed over 5% on Monday after news broke that Trump‚Äôs transition team is hitting the gas pedal on federal self-driving car regulations.¬†

For Musk, this feels like a scripted Hollywood plot: championing Trump‚Äôs return to the White House and now potentially reaping the rewards. The potential framework would dismantle red tape, allowing Tesla to scale its futuristic Cybercab and Robovan models beyond the current 2,500-unit limit. Forget steering wheels and pedals‚ÄîMusk‚Äôs robotaxi vision might finally leave the station.

**Regulatory Road Trip**  
  
Trump‚Äôs transition team has ambitious plans to reshape how autonomous vehicles hit the streets. Key names like former Uber exec Emil Michael and policy-minded Republican reps are being floated for leadership at the Department of Transportation.

Musk‚Äôs dream of making driverless Teslas mainstream‚Äîthink fleets of robotaxis chauffeuring passengers without human backup‚Äîis closer than ever, thanks to these early-stage efforts. Cue the popcorn.

**Winners, Losers, and Sideliners**  
  
While Tesla basked in market love, Uber and Lyft investors weren‚Äôt thrilled, with both stocks dropping over 6%.¬†

Musk‚Äôs robotaxis could eventually outprice and outpace ridesharing apps. Meanwhile, Waymo and GM‚Äôs Cruise might feel the heat, as they‚Äôve played it safe by sticking to autonomous cars with traditional controls. For Tesla, the stakes are clear: dominate the robotaxi race or stay stuck in regulatory limbo.

**Is This the Green Light?**  
  
Musk‚Äôs close ties to the incoming administration position Tesla as a frontrunner in the race for autonomous dominance. But before anyone pops champagne, Congress still needs to clear the road for mass deployment.¬†

If Trump‚Äôs team can pull this off, Musk‚Äôs long-promised vision could go from moonshot to market reality‚Äîsteering the conversation and, potentially, the future of mobility.

# Super Micro Climbs Out of the Abyss

**A Compliance Comeback?**  
  
Super Micro Computer, a server maker basking in the AI boom spotlight, made a dramatic leap in after-hours trading, with shares spiking over 37%.¬†

The catalyst? A Hail Mary compliance plan filed with Nasdaq, complete with a new auditor‚ÄîBDO USA‚Äîto replace Ernst & Young, who bailed last month citing governance concerns. Investors seem to believe Super Micro‚Äôs cleanup effort might actually stick this time.

**Scandals, Probes, and Short Sellers‚ÄîOh My!**  
  
The road here hasn‚Äôt exactly been smooth. Super Micro delayed its financial filings this summer, prompting a short-seller hit piece from Hindenburg Research and a DOJ probe.

Toss in a Nasdaq delisting warning, and this once $70 billion darling now finds itself valued at a mere $12.6 billion. Still, its pivot to AI-focused hardware has kept it relevant‚Äîand kept its ticker on traders' watchlists.

**AI Keeps the Lights On**  
  
Super Micro continues to ride Nvidia‚Äôs AI wave, unveiling products powered by the chipmaker‚Äôs shiny new Blackwell processors. That‚Äôs a big win in a market obsessed with AI innovation.¬†

But let‚Äôs not get carried away‚ÄîWall Street‚Äôs excitement is tempered by the company‚Äôs checkered financial reporting history and underwhelming guidance.

**Will It Stick?**¬†With its Nasdaq fate hanging in the balance until February, Super Micro has a lot to prove. The company‚Äôs internal governance overhaul and fresh promises to meet filing deadlines could keep it afloat‚Äîif they deliver. For now, investors are cautiously optimistic, but like all good cliffhangers, we‚Äôll have to wait to see how this one ends.

The housing market‚Äôs supply problem isn‚Äôt getting better anytime soon. Tomorrow‚Äôs report on housing starts will shed light on how many new homes are in the works, while building permit data will offer clues about what‚Äôs coming down the pipeline.

September didn‚Äôt bring much relief‚Äînew home construction dipped 0.5% to 1.35 million, and permits fell 2.9%. Economists expect October‚Äôs numbers to hold steady, but the real hope lies in lower interest rates eventually sparking a surge in builder activity. Fingers crossed.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).¬†

With Kennedy‚Äôs track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide.¬†

The market‚Äôs verdict? Kennedy‚Äôs policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy‚Äôs HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy‚Äîand leadership of Children‚Äôs Health Defense, an anti-vax group‚Äîhas industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds.¬†

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy‚Äôs views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales.¬†

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy‚Äôs influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers‚Äô performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy‚Äôs nomination is confirmed.¬†

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy‚Äôs potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Disney Surges On Streaming Growth

Disney posted a strong Q4, crediting streaming wins and blockbuster hits for a 6% revenue rise, landing at $22.57 billion.¬†

Bob Iger, back in the driver‚Äôs seat, forecasted earnings growth in the high single digits for 2025, with double-digit jumps through 2027. That news sent Disney‚Äôs stock up 9%‚Äîa glimmer of magic in an otherwise challenging media landscape.

# Streaming Soars, Cable Sinks

Disney+ and friends (Hulu and ESPN+) notched a solid $321 million in profit, even adding 4.4 million new subscribers as its ad-supported tier gained traction.¬†

Meanwhile, cable kept sliding, with revenue down 38% in a quarter where cord-cutting hit hard. It‚Äôs clear: streaming is Disney‚Äôs leading role now, as cable fades into the background.

# The Box Office Magic Lives On

Thanks to¬†*Inside Out 2*¬†and¬†*Deadpool & Wolverine*, Disney‚Äôs studio turned in $316 million in quarterly profits, with both films setting records. As Disney eyes the holiday box office with¬†*Moana 2*¬†and¬†*Mufasa*, the studio‚Äôs on track to remain a top profit machine, contributing to a 14% jump in entertainment revenue.

# Parks Keep Rolling Amid Storms

Theme parks felt the squeeze from rising costs and lower international attendance, but domestic parks held their own with solid guest spending.¬†

Disney forecasts 6-8% growth for the parks in 2025, banking on upcoming expansions to keep the magic alive for tourists, even as international foot traffic takes a breather.

# Spirit Airlines Braces for Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines is flirting with bankruptcy after a last-ditch merger attempt with Frontier fizzled out.¬†

The ultra-budget airline is now in talks with creditors on a restructuring plan that would potentially wipe out its equity holders, sending Spirit‚Äôs stock plummeting over 59% on Wednesday.¬†

So, if you‚Äôre holding Spirit shares, let‚Äôs just say it might be time to buckle up.

# Grounded Merger Plans Leave Spirit Scrambling

Merger hopes were high for Spirit after talks with both JetBlue and Frontier put a lifeline in sight. But after JetBlue‚Äôs bid got axed by antitrust concerns, Frontier was the next best hope ‚Äì until now.¬†

With that deal grounded, Spirit is left scrambling to negotiate its survival with bondholders. Analysts say that without a merger, Spirit may need to sell off aircraft and other assets to handle its hefty debt load, giving bondholders the upper hand over shareholders in any final deal.

# Trimming Wings to Stay Afloat

Already in belt-tightening mode, Spirit‚Äôs been trimming its fleet, furloughing pilots, and offloading older planes in a bid to free up cash.¬†

Yet, with a hefty $1.1 billion bond deadline on the horizon, the airline‚Äôs runway is looking short. Wall Street‚Äôs not holding its breath: with zero ‚Äúbuy‚Äù ratings and eight ‚Äúsell‚Äù recommendations, the consensus seems clear.¬†

Now, it‚Äôs a waiting game to see if Spirit can emerge from this nosedive intact.

# Amazon Takes On Temu and Shein With Discount ‚ÄòAmazon Haul‚Äô store

Amazon is making a play for the ultra-low-price crowd with its latest launch,¬†*Amazon Haul*. Simply type ‚Äúhaul‚Äù into your amazon app and hit enter.

Touted as an affordable answer to Temu and Shein, Haul features a selection of everyday items capped at $20, with many under $10. In this new section, you‚Äôll find deals like $1 iPhone cases and $5 packs of holiday socks.¬†

But there‚Äôs a trade-off: while Amazon has long been known for its quick Prime delivery, Haul shoppers will need to wait a bit‚Äîdeliveries clock in at one to two weeks, mirroring the timelines of its Chinese rivals.

# Discounts Stack as Baskets Grow

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is offering extra discounts for larger orders, with 5% off for purchases over $50 and 10% off over $75, plus free shipping on orders above $25.¬†

The Haul selection covers a broad range of categories‚Äîfrom fashion and home goods to electronics and lifestyle items‚Äîall with an eye-catching ‚Äúcrazy low‚Äù price tag. Amazon‚Äôs VP of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, Dharmesh Mehta, says Haul is designed for those willing to wait a little longer to save a lot more, adding some fun and affordability to Amazon‚Äôs app experience.

It‚Äôs a clear signal that Amazon is targeting shoppers who prioritize deals over delivery speed.

# Playing the Long Game on Low Prices

Haul isn‚Äôt just a new section; it‚Äôs Amazon‚Äôs response to the rise of bargain-focused apps like Temu, which are chipping away at the traditional e-commerce model with rock-bottom pricing.¬†

Amazon‚Äôs willingness to take the slow lane on delivery suggests a bet on customers who are still more comfortable shopping with a familiar brand but are willing to explore lower-cost options. With all products screened for compliance,¬†

Amazon is aiming to sidestep the counterfeits and regulatory issues dogging Temu and Shein, providing Haul shoppers a budget-friendly and trustworthy shopping experience.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs got two big numbers on deck: first up, initial jobless claims‚Äîa quick check on the labor market‚Äôs pulse, which is still front and center in the Fed‚Äôs rate-cutting game plan. Expect last month‚Äôs hurricane chaos and labor strikes to show up here, so don‚Äôt be surprised if the numbers look rough. Jerome Powell likely won‚Äôt hit the brakes just yet.

We‚Äôll also see the Producer Price Index (PPI), which shows inflation from the perspective of producers, not shoppers. Manufacturers have been taking it on the chin lately with rising costs and rates, but last month‚Äôs flat reading sparked a bit of hope that things might be stabilizing.

# Before Market Open:

# Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Amid Trump Win

Tesla's back in the trillion-dollar club. Shares skyrocketed 8% Friday, pushing its market cap over the $1 trillion threshold as investors jumped on the potential for looser regulations in a Trump administration.¬†

Elon Musk, Trump‚Äôs most vocal supporter and a generous campaign contributor, saw Tesla surge about 30% this week alone. With hints at slashing electric vehicle subsidies and potential trade barriers for Chinese EV players, Wall Street sees a Trump-Musk partnership as a boon for Tesla‚Äôs market share in the U.S.

**A Boost for Musk‚Äôs Billions**

The Tesla rally has also catapulted Musk‚Äôs net worth past $300 billion, marking his highest fortune since 2021. Musk has been outspoken about leveraging his influence in Trump‚Äôs administration to accelerate federal approval for autonomous vehicles, a critical step for Tesla‚Äôs self-driving ambitions.¬†

The partnership comes at a strategic moment, with Tesla now vying against Alphabet-owned Waymo in the autonomous driving race.

**Trump Trade Implications for Tesla‚Äôs Competitors**

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives noted that Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance could place Musk in a highly favorable position, shielding Tesla from new EV subsidies that have leveled the field for foreign competitors.¬†

Meanwhile, U.S. rivals and industry giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft now sit alongside Tesla in the trillion-dollar tech club, with Wall Street eagerly eyeing who will come out on top in this new era of deregulation.

# Retailers Are Prepping For Tariffs

Trump‚Äôs back in office, and with him comes a tariff policy that‚Äôs sending ripples through retail. With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers.¬†

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a ‚Äútax on American families.‚Äù Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.

**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**

Retailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers‚Äô wallets hard.¬†

Stores that rely heavily on China for sourcing‚Äîlike Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers‚Äîare particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.

**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**

Not every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump‚Äôs first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit.¬†

As some retailers scramble, those who‚Äôve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what‚Äôs shaping up to be another trade showdown.

# The Trump Trade Is So Back

With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything.¬†

After Trump‚Äôs decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it‚Äôs 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration.

**Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring**

In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B

anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains‚Äîinvestors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride.

Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump‚Äôs pledge to make the U.S. the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet.‚Äù And oil‚Äôs back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future.

**Clean Energy, Not So Much:**¬†Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump‚Äôs clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind.

**Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:**¬†Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It‚Äôs on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†While Wall Street‚Äôs in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be ‚Äútoo optimistic,‚Äù and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the ‚ÄúTrump Trade‚Äù seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it‚Äôs best to keep one hand on the exit.

# Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment

Betting markets took a big W this week, as former President Donald Trump‚Äôs election win confirmed what sites like Kalshi and Polymarket have been shouting for weeks: the odds were in Trump‚Äôs favor, despite what the polls claimed. With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight.

Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds.¬†

For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate‚Äîand maybe even profit‚Äîon real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves.

**Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious**

The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets.

Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone‚Äôs trying to cash in on this new political betting boom.

**The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting**

On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They‚Äôre worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader.

So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they‚Äôll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell.

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs lineup starts with initial jobless claims‚Äîaka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It‚Äôs a big deal for the Fed‚Äôs next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision.

So, what‚Äôs the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It‚Äôs a smaller dip than the one in September, but that‚Äôs the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market‚Äôs been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer‚Äôs panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts.

But don‚Äôt get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell‚Äôs press conference later in the day. The man‚Äôs words and the Fed‚Äôs follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead.

# Election Day Showdown: Trump vs. Harris And Your Portfolio

It‚Äôs finally Election Day, and after a campaign season that brought us viral squirrels, bear sightings, and unexpected pet memes, we‚Äôre getting back to the real talk: What does this mean for the economy?¬†

Trump and Harris are pitching policies that could shake up your portfolio‚Äîhere‚Äôs a breakdown of their promises, from taxes to trade and everything in between.

**Big Tax Moves**

Both candidates are waving different tax flags. Harris wants to roll the corporate tax rate up to 28%, targeting high earners with a minimum 25% tax on mega-wealth (those with over $100 million) and boosting capital gains for millionaires to 28%.¬†

Trump, on the other hand, aims to lower the corporate rate to 15% for U.S.-based manufacturing and continue the individual and estate tax cuts he pushed in 2017. For big companies, these tax changes could directly affect their bottom lines, impacting market values and shareholder earnings.

**Tariffs & Trade**

Trump's plans are bolder when it comes to tariffs, proposing a 10% across-the-board levy on imports and up to a 200% tariff on Mexican-made cars. The goal? A ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù resurgence, though economists warn this could send prices up across consumer goods.¬†

Harris hasn‚Äôt proposed anything quite as drastic but has hinted she‚Äôd maintain Biden-era tariffs. While Trump‚Äôs approach is all about pushing U.S. manufacturing, Harris‚Äôs steadier stance may appeal to those wary of increased inflation risks.

**What‚Äôs Next for Your Portfolio?**

Analysts suggest a Harris administration could benefit clean energy, healthcare, and homebuilding sectors, while Trump could mean gains for oil, financials, and crypto.¬†

But here‚Äôs the kicker: No matter who wins, staying diversified is key. Historically, the market has weathered administrations of all stripes and come out on top, and experts say focusing on long-term investments over election reactions is a winning strategy.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Campaign rhetoric is one thing; actual policy is another. Congress has a knack for turning grand ideas into smaller compromises, so while the headlines might sound big, the reality might be more tempered. As we head into a period of potential market jitters, a steady hand and a diversified portfolio might be the most presidential decision you can make.

# Boeing Ends Crippling Strike as Workers Accept Latest Offer

After a 53-day standoff, Boeing‚Äôs machinists are ready to trade picket signs for power tools again. In a nail-biter of a vote, 59% of union members gave the thumbs-up to a new contract that includes a hefty 38% pay bump over four years. '

Boeing‚Äôs production lines can finally get back in gear, which means more jets‚Äîand less red ink.

**A Deal That Soars Higher Than a 737**

This new contract is a big win for Boeing‚Äôs workforce. We‚Äôre talking a 13% instant pay boost, with average salaries climbing to around $119,000 by the end of the deal. Plus, there‚Äôs a $12,000 signing bonus to sweeten the pot.¬†

After years of less-than-stellar raises, machinists have muscled in some major gains‚Äîthough it did take seven weeks of picketing and freezing fingers to make it happen.

**New CEO, New Strategy, and a Costly Pause**

For Boeing‚Äôs new CEO Kelly Ortberg, it‚Äôs been a turbulent start. Since August, he‚Äôs been cutting costs, raising cash, and trying to stay aloft amid production halts and stock hits. The strike alone was draining Boeing of $100 million a day‚Äîsomething the jet giant could hardly afford as shares plummeted over 40% this year.¬†

The settlement is welcome news, but getting production back up to speed won‚Äôt be instant, especially with 737 MAX orders still lagging.

**What‚Äôs Next: Planes, Patience, and Recovery**

Machinists will be back on the factory floor this week, but don‚Äôt expect planes to roll out overnight. Boeing‚Äôs whole supply chain, from fuselage makers to flight-schedule-hungry airlines, took a hit during the strike.

Ramping up production will take time, and Boeing‚Äôs finances are far from stable, with the company still predicting a cash flow drought through 2025.

The bottom line? Boeing may have scored a truce with its workers, but it‚Äôs still got plenty of turbulence to ride out on its journey back to cruising altitude.

# Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs Cash Fortress Tops $300 Billion

Warren Buffett‚Äôs cash stash at Berkshire Hathaway is looking more like a cash fortress, ballooning to a record-breaking $325 billion.¬†

It‚Äôs a fortune even Buffett isn‚Äôt sure how to spend, as he keeps dodging big-ticket buys and instead cashes out on old faves like Apple and Bank of America. Why the hoarding? Some say he‚Äôs just too seasoned to overpay in today‚Äôs market; others think he‚Äôs plotting something big.

Either way, he‚Äôs showing us what real self-control looks like.

**Apple on a Diet, Cash on a Bulk-Up**

Buffett trimmed Berkshire‚Äôs Apple stake by another 25% this quarter, whittling it down to $69.9 billion. Even though the iPhone maker still holds the crown as Berkshire‚Äôs biggest holding, it‚Äôs clear Buffett‚Äôs leaning out the tech exposure.¬†

The kicker? This isn‚Äôt a tech-love breakup, just a careful rebalancing to make sure Apple doesn‚Äôt end up becoming the whole show.

**Buybacks? Not This Time**

Usually, Buffett‚Äôs all about scooping up his own shares when Berkshire‚Äôs cash pile is high, but this quarter, buybacks took a timeout. And that‚Äôs surprising, given Berkshire‚Äôs been on a 25% winning streak this year.¬†

Analysts speculate he‚Äôs holding out for the¬†*really*¬†right moment to jump back in‚Äîbecause why not, when cash is stacking up faster than Wall Street can blink?

**Cash-Burning Dreams:**¬†So, what‚Äôs next for Buffett‚Äôs billions? Will he finally splurge on something big, like a mega-acquisition? Or is he playing the long game, waiting for stock prices to cool off before making any serious moves? One thing‚Äôs clear: the Oracle of Omaha knows patience is a virtue‚Äîand he‚Äôs got the cash mountain to prove it.

# Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‚ÄòUnwavering‚Äô AI Demand

Palantir just dropped a knockout earnings report, sending its stock up 15% after hours. Revenue shot up 30% in Q3 to $725.5 million, leaving analysts' forecasts in the dust. But the real kicker?¬†

Demand for Palantir‚Äôs AI tech in the U.S. is off the charts, setting the company up for a stellar year with a new revenue target of nearly $2.81 billion.

**The U.S. Appetite for AI**

Business is booming stateside, with commercial revenue up 54% and government revenue climbing 40% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp didn‚Äôt hold back, describing this as ‚Äúunwavering demand‚Äù that‚Äôs positioning Palantir front and center in an AI-powered revolution.

The U.S. government‚Äôs appetite for advanced data tools is a big driver, making Palantir‚Äôs AI solutions essential for organizations seeking smarter, more efficient operations.

**Boosted Guidance Lights Up Investors**

With a solid quarter under its belt, Palantir has raised its guidance, now expecting full-year revenue to land between $2.805 and $2.809 billion‚Äîwell above Wall Street‚Äôs estimates.¬†

Q4‚Äôs forecast looks equally strong, with revenue projected as high as $771 million. Given AI‚Äôs moment in the spotlight, investors are betting on Palantir‚Äôs long-term potential in this high-stakes arena.

**Global Hiccups, U.S. Dominance**

While the U.S. powers Palantir‚Äôs growth, international sales are a mixed bag, particularly in Europe, where commercial revenue slipped this quarter. Yet Karp remains optimistic, seeing the U.S. as the core of Palantir‚Äôs AI growth.¬†

As these tools become integral across industries, Palantir‚Äôs strong domestic foothold could keep it leading the pack, even as it navigates a few global bumps.

"Stock Market Today: Super Micro's Auditor Resigns + Russia Fines Google More Than The World's Entire GDP* What goes up must come down. After hitting a fresh all-time high earlier this week on Big Tech earnings optimism, the Nasdaq took a nosedive, logging its worst day in almost two months. Microsoft and Meta led the tumble, each posting earnings that raised red flags over ballooning AI expenses. The Nasdaq slid 2.7%, the S&P 500 dropped 1.9%, and even the Dow wasn‚Äôt spared, losing 0.9%‚Äîa rough end to the month for all three major indexes.
* Wall Street was banking on a strong showing from Big Tech, but Thursday‚Äôs earnings reports delivered a reality check. Mixed results from other tech heavyweights left investors grappling for direction, with market jitters clearly lingering into after-hours trading.

# Super Micro Computer‚Äôs Auditor Ernst & Young resigns¬†

Super Micro‚Äôs rollercoaster ride hit a nosedive as Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as its auditor, citing ‚Äúintegrity concerns‚Äù that raised red flags on the company‚Äôs accounting practices.

EY‚Äôs exit sent the stock tumbling 33%, its worst drop in six years, and now leaves Super Micro scrambling for a new auditor just as the DOJ investigates allegations of revenue inflation from a former employee. For a company that surged with AI-driven demand earlier this year, the timing of these setbacks couldn‚Äôt be worse.

**Trust Issues and Rival Gains**  
  
This isn‚Äôt the first time Super Micro has come under fire for its numbers. Earlier this year, Hindenburg Research spotlighted the company for ‚Äúglaring accounting red flags,‚Äù leading Super Micro to delay its annual financial report while it reassessed internal controls.¬†

Meanwhile, rivals like Dell may seize this moment to gain ground in the lucrative AI server market, where Super Micro has been a major player. As the stock continues to slump, the company‚Äôs competitors are watching closely.

**Delisting Risks Add Pressure**  
  
Super Micro‚Äôs troubles don‚Äôt end with its audit chaos. The company faces a November 16 deadline to regain compliance with Nasdaq rules or risk being delisted, a position it previously found itself in back in 2018.¬†

With time running out to find a new auditor, analysts are sounding alarms about the company‚Äôs future on the exchange. EY‚Äôs exit is a stark reminder of the fragility of market trust, and Super Micro now finds itself on thin ice with both Nasdaq and investors.

**Facing the Climb Back**  
  
Amid the upheaval, Super Micro is sticking to its core business promises, assuring stakeholders that its customer commitments and product roadmap remain on track. Yet, with its stock down over 75% from March highs and sentiment shaky, Super Micro‚Äôs future looks precarious.¬†

For a company that soared on the AI hype, rebuilding credibility with investors will require more than just words‚Äîit‚Äôll need clear, clean financials and an auditor willing to sign on the dotted line.

* **ü§ñ¬†Big Tech Ramps Up AI Spending, Stocks Face Profit Pressure:**¬†Meta and Microsoft are¬†investing heavily in AI infrastructure, with Microsoft‚Äôs quarterly AI spending hitting $20B and Meta forecasting higher AI costs next year. Limited AI chip supply and profit concerns have contributed to recent stock declines across the sector. ($META), ($MSFT)
* **üöó¬†BYD Tops Tesla in Revenue Amid Strong Domestic Demand:**¬†Chinese EV maker BYD has reported $28.2B in Q3 revenue,¬†surpassing Tesla‚Äôs $25.2B as domestic subsidies fuel demand, though BYD now faces new E.U. tariffs impacting its outlook. ($BYDDF), ($TSLA)
* **üõ†Ô∏è¬†Boeing Resumes Union Talks with Federal Mediation:**¬†Boeing has¬†returned to negotiations¬†with the union representing 33,000 striking workers, facilitated by Acting U.S. Labor Secretary Julie Su. ($BA)
* **‚úàÔ∏è¬†U.S. Airlines Soar on Profits and Fare Hikes:**¬†American Airlines raised its profit forecast, and Delta projects a strong Q4,¬†driven by reduced capacity and higher fares. Airline stocks have gained 23% since July, nearly tripling the S&P 500‚Äôs performance. ($AAL), ($DAL)
* **üì∫¬†Comcast Considers Spinning Off Cable Networks Amid Industry Shifts:**¬†Comcast is¬†exploring the separation of NBCUniversal‚Äôs cable networks¬†as a potential step toward a broader media reconfiguration. With assets like Bravo, Syfy, and CNBC, the move could spark consolidation among traditional cable players, especially as Comcast shifts focus to its streaming platform, Peacock. If successful, the spin-off could pave the way for more streamlined media companies in an industry increasingly dominated by streaming. ($CMCSA)

# Russia Fines Google More Than The World's Entire GDP

Russia just dropped a $20¬†*decillion*¬†fine on Google‚Äîyes, that‚Äôs 20 followed by 33 zeros.¬†

This ‚Äúsymbolic gesture,‚Äù as the Kremlin puts it, demands that Google unblock Russian state-supported media on YouTube, which the tech giant restricted following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. While the sum is way beyond Google‚Äôs own market value, Moscow‚Äôs message is loud and clear: follow our rules, or face the fines.

**From Courts to Chaos**  
  
Google initially expected any disputes over blocked Russian channels to play out in U.S. or U.K. courts. Instead, Russian media companies have taken the fight global, with cases popping up from South Africa to Turkey.¬†

In one wild twist, South Africa‚Äôs High Court even approved the seizure of some Google assets, part of a broader Russian push to target Western companies ignoring local rulings.

**When Courts Become Weapons**  
  
Legal experts are calling this ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù‚Äîusing courts as geopolitical pawns. Russia‚Äôs recent laws let its courts go after Western companies as payback for sanctions, and as the fines pile up, experts warn this is just the start.¬†

The ongoing fines, doubling weekly, represent a fundamental shift in how international companies are forced to think about geopolitical risk, especially as Russian and Western courts butt heads.

**Just a Symbolic Sting?**  
  
Google, for its part, is playing it cool, saying these legal hurdles won‚Äôt hit the bottom line. Alphabet shares held steady, reflecting Wall Street‚Äôs confidence that these fines won‚Äôt put a dent in the company‚Äôs trillion-dollar valuation.¬†

For now, Google is calling Russia‚Äôs bluff‚Äîbut with fines stacking up, it‚Äôs clear the stakes are high if this legal storm doesn‚Äôt blow over.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Brace yourselves: the US jobs report is coming, and it‚Äôs the one that could make or break the markets‚Ä¶again. This is the same report that sent shockwaves in August, and if October‚Äôs numbers fall short, we might be in for a repeat. Economists are projecting just 120,000 new jobs, a major dip from September‚Äôs jaw-dropping 254,000. And thanks to hurricanes and strikes muddying the picture, no one‚Äôs totally sure what to expect. The unemployment rate? It‚Äôs expected to hang tight at 4.1%.

Luckily, the earnings frenzy has calmed down a bit, so Friday‚Äôs looking pretty chill‚Äîunless, of course, the job numbers stir the pot.",11-01-2024
"PLEASE HELP - advice needed desperately Hi Everyone!

I've been trading for the last 5 years, and ofc I blew 2 accounts. They weren't big, approximately I blew 2500 USD. Mostly it was occasionally. I would study graphs and indicators; I saw that as developing trading intuition, and it seems to me that I managed to do it. I started day trading again in August, with 100 USD starting capital and for now it's quite successful. Here is my PnL:

[From August 9th till today.](https://preview.redd.it/glumwyhv72yd1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=666100a168b78b6e885289d7c54b6f84b61aa166)

Most of the losing days are the days I don't trade it's just the funding fee for the positions held open for days. Usually, I have 1-3 losing days as you can see below, in the analysis for September. 

https://preview.redd.it/bg8f3e3s82yd1.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ef250adbdb0bf40dea1794a0c90c699e02dd0a

Trading crypto futures on Binance, more specifically: Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Neiro. I do use leverage, often quite high, but my positions are small, and mostly long, so I can't get liquidated. 

I use RSI, moving averages, volume, and support/resistance lines. My preference is trading within a range, I'm not searching for breakouts. Mostly my trades are closed within 2 hours, but some of them I keep for days. I prefer scalping, and that's something I like doing, although it requires a lot of my time to be successful. In the end, it's just a mix of all possible strategies. Trade started with the idea of scalping, but then the opportunity to let it run occurs, and I just let it be.

Gold trading and forex are something I would also like to start doing but I'm not sure if it would be too much. So should I start doing that too? Do you have any suggestions where and how to start? I'm from Europe, more specifically European Union.

I like trading and would like to have a career in it.  Got a finance masters degree, have some experience in financial controlling, and entrepreneurship (agriculture and marketing), but would also like to become a financial analyst (I'm proficient with Excel, financial planning and analysis, DCF, and stock analysis).  Had two interviews for the mentioned position but they picked other candidates because they had more experience and were willing to work for less money.

Another thing I would also like to do is stock valuations. I recently did Tesla and BYD valuation for my master's thesis. People (mostly uni professors) told me I am great at it and should pursue a career in that field. Are there any pages where I can post my valuations and analysis?

As you can see I have a lot of fields of interest hahaha

To put my main interests (and I have many more) in the same place: 

\-crypto, 

\-gold and silver, 

\-euro and dollar, 

\-car manufacturer industry,

\-researching financial frauds, 

\-construction industry, 

\-and agriculture (I'm currently in beekeeping and honey business)

All of my friends have specific interests and jobs, and it just makes me kinda depressed that I would like to do a lot of different things. 

Can you guys give me some advice on what should I do? Should I stick to trading? Valuation? Entrepreneurship? 

Should I stick to crypto trading or try other things too?

Maybe I posted this in the wrong subreddit, but it just seems to me there are a lot of similar people in trading, correct me if I'm wrong. 

Any advice is good, as long as I get them. (Crucify me, just don't turn the cross upside down hahaha)",10-31-2024
"28/10 - PREMARKET REPORT - All the major market moving news  from hours of premarket reading all condensed into one 5 minute read. **MACRO DATA:**

* China industrial profits numbers come in at -3.5% vs 0.3% expected. Hence weak China industrial profit numbers.¬†
* Treasury auctions today for 6 month, 3 month, 2 year and 5 year.¬†
* With bonds a key focus at the moment in the market, being elevated, these treasury auctions are going to be that much more important.¬†

**MARKETS AND FX:**

* Japan‚Äôs Ruling LDP loses majority - uncertainty in parliament and markets.¬†
* Fell short of the 233 seat majority, only secured 215 seats. This means SHigeru Ishiba has to find new allies within 30 days to keep power. **The Bank of Japan‚Äôs rate path may face added complications with a weaker government. So less rate hikes.**
* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this.¬†
* Oil down as ISrael attack on Iran didnt target any oil facilities but instead focused on military bases. This reduces supply disruption which removes a tailwind for oil. Iran also downplayed the attack saying they do not want war. Traders had been bullish on oil on fri, v strong flow, but now IV crush lower. Traders caught out. nearing next support zone at 65.5-67
* SPX: Slightly higher, trading above the 5835 key level.¬†
* Nasdaq: Bounced off of 20,500 level in premarket. Most major big tech names higher.¬†
* Dow Jones: After sell off over last week, is just trying to recover the breakout at 42,300.¬†
* HKG50 - flat, despite China‚Äôs announcement of more stimulus. This shows that the stimulus announced did little to wet the appetite of investors.¬†
* GER40: gapped up but pared all the gains now flat on the day.¬†
* VIX: maintaining at 19.24.
* bond yields elevated. I will be hoping to see bond yields cool off as a result of plunging oil prices. Higher bond yields are a headwind to teh amrket as they attract invstor capital away from equities. We want to see bond yields fall asap, which should happen if we look at historical data on rising bond yields following the first rate cut.

**MAG 7:**

* TSLA - Bernstein gives another underperform rating, price target at 120. I think Bernstein can basically be ignored at this point. They are Tesla perma bulls and it‚Äôs just getting boring at this point. Said that margin strength in last quarter was driven by one off deferred revenue recognitions and commodity contract renewals. Said 20-30% unit growth as Tesla suggested is unlikely.
* TSLA - Price target raised to 298 from 278 at Canaccord, who maintain their buy rating.¬†
* TSLA - price target raised to 285 from 225 at Daiwa. Maintained at Buy.¬†
* These are more respectable price targets although I think Canaccord are closer to the mark.¬†
* TSLA.- extends its 5 year 0% interest loan offer in China until November 30th - increasing incentives on China demand. Applies to rear wheel drive and long range versions.¬†
* MST ahead of earnings, Truist mark as a buy, says they are set to outperform across key enterprise categories. Price target 600.¬†
* AAPL - JPM say that in their tracker of Apple product availability (as a proxy of demand), they see that lead times are more or less in line with iPhone 15, hence demand resilient.¬†

OTHER COMPANIES:

* Crypto names all higher in premarket again on strong bitcoin price action.
* Oil stocks all lower obviously on oil dumping. ¬†
* CORZ - Jefferies initiated with buy rating, price target of 19. Said journey is impressive post bankruptcy comeback story. Said they are now utilising their power for Ai focused data centres.¬†

* INTC - expanding their facility in Chengdu, China in order to boost server chip packaging.¬†
* GPN - Bernstein says that they are rated at market perform, and represent a potential activist investor play.¬†

* Volkswagen is planning to cut costs, considering a 10% wage bill reduction and 2 year wage freeze. Also potential to cap bonuses for top employees
* TSM has suspended shipments to chinese chipmaker Sophgo after the TSM chips were found on Huawei‚Äôs Ascend. They say that Sophgo illegally redistributed TSM chips.
* Bigger news, TSM founder says the firm can still see most severe challenges from US restrictions.¬†
* MCD - ahead of earnings tomorrow, they announce they are bringing back quarter pounders next week after e coli outbreak is contained. Said that the contaminated products are no longer in their supply chain.¬†
* Boeing is planing a $15B+ capital raise in order to avoid junk credit rating. They will raise this through. Mix of equity dn convertible debt. Wants to boost liquidity and keep investment grade status.¬†

* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this.¬†
* BOJ will be on this week, expectation is for holding.¬†
* UK BUDGET WILL BE ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK. EXPECTATION IS FOR HIGHER BORROWING, TAX HIKES AND HIGHER SPENDING. Likely will see net growth positive budget, so more likely for cautious BoE cuts.¬†
* Big tech earnings this week - generally, major desks are optimistic going into the week.¬† JPM says the fact that any earnings question marks are being overlooked entirely with NFLX, NOW and VRT, bodes well for Mega cap earnings this week.¬†
* Apple in my opinion the one most likely to disappoint.¬†
* China announces a new outright open market reverse repo tool, targeting primary dealers.¬†

I'm on the hunt for some brokerage research reports on Tesla (TSLA) to get a better grasp of the company's financials and industry trends. I'm looking for the actual PDFs that the brokers publish, but I'm kinda new to this and not sure where the best places are to find these reports.

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple‚Äôs reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card.¬†

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren‚Äôt properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation.¬†

On top of that, Apple‚Äôs checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman‚Äôs Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn‚Äôt escape the CFPB‚Äôs scrutiny either.¬†

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren‚Äôt acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards.¬†

The situation was worsened by Goldman‚Äôs failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping‚Äîand they didn‚Äôt hold back.¬†

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO‚Äôs portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor‚Äôs ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn‚Äôt just about grabbing new leagues. TKO‚Äôs getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million.¬†

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they‚Äôre serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO‚Äôs shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO‚Äôs stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What‚Äôs Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO‚Äôs President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup.¬†

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues‚Äîthey‚Äôre stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though‚Äîat least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO‚Äôs not looking to buy more assets from its parent company.¬†

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

# Tesla Notches a Blowout Quarter on Strong Sales, Credits

Tesla is back in the fast lane.¬†

The EV giant reported third-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations, clocking in at 72 cents per share and ending a four-quarter losing streak.¬†

Demand for Tesla‚Äôs cars rebounded in a big way, with CEO Elon Musk forecasting a potential 20-30% growth in deliveries next year. Shares surged 12% in late trading, marking a sharp turnaround for the stock, which had been down 14% this year.

Tesla‚Äôs quarterly win wasn‚Äôt just about sales, though. The company raked in $739 million from regulatory credits‚Äîselling them to carmakers who need help meeting emissions targets. It‚Äôs clear that Tesla‚Äôs profits are being boosted not only by the cars on the road but also by the deals happening behind the scenes.

**Driving Growth with New Models and Margins**  
Musk‚Äôs big plans don‚Äôt stop there. Tesla reiterated its commitment to rolling out more affordable models by 2025, while its futuristic Cybertruck is finally profitable after a production ramp-up. And there‚Äôs more good news: Tesla‚Äôs gross margin (excluding credits) jumped to 17.1% from 14.6% last quarter.

The company is also steering full throttle into autonomous driving. Musk teased a robotaxi service, set to launch in Texas and California next year. If the tech holds up (and regulators play ball), this could be a game-changer for Tesla‚Äôs future business model.

**What‚Äôs Next?**  
While Tesla‚Äôs recent results are impressive, challenges lie ahead. T

he company faces stiff competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, along with legacy brands such as Ford and GM stepping up their EV game. Tesla also needs a strong Q4 to top last year‚Äôs deliveries, and heavy price cuts could keep pressuring its margins.

Still, with its sights set on affordable models and a driverless future, Tesla seems ready to ride out the storm. Investors are watching closely to see if this momentum can carry the stock even higher.

# Arm to Scrap Qualcomm Chip Design License, Feud Escalates

Arm just threw a major curveball at Qualcomm.¬†

The UK-based chip designer is pulling the plug on a key license agreement, giving Qualcomm 60 days to fix their messy legal spat or risk losing access to critical tech.¬†

Qualcomm, known for powering most Android smartphones, might be forced to stop selling its flagship processors if it can‚Äôt resolve the issue.

This isn‚Äôt just a minor tiff‚Äîboth companies took a hit. Arm‚Äôs shares dropped 6.67%, and Qualcomm‚Äôs fell 3.8% as the markets weighed the potential fallout of this escalating feud. If the license gets scrapped, Qualcomm‚Äôs $39 billion chip business could be on the chopping block.

**Why the Beef?**  
The bad blood dates back to 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm for breach of contract over its acquisition of Nuvia, a chip-design startup.¬†

Qualcomm says the lawsuit is just Arm trying to strong-arm (pun intended) them into paying higher royalties. Now, Arm‚Äôs stepping things up by threatening to cancel Qualcomm‚Äôs rights to use its chip architecture.

Qualcomm has big plans for Nuvia‚Äôs tech‚Äîits AI-driven PC processors are already hitting the market. If Arm‚Äôs move sticks, Qualcomm may need to scrap Nuvia‚Äôs designs entirely, a costly setback that could give competitors a golden opportunity.

**What‚Äôs Next?**  
With a December trial looming, many see Arm‚Äôs license termination as a bargaining chip to gain leverage.¬†

Qualcomm, however, is no stranger to courtroom drama, having settled disputes with Apple and Nokia in the past. A settlement seems likely, but if not, both companies could face serious damage.

# IMF Lowers Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Increasing Risks

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)‚Äîaka the global economy‚Äôs watchdog‚Äîis sounding the alarm on next year‚Äôs growth prospects.¬†

The IMF, which keeps tabs on the financial health of its 190 member countries, has cut its global growth forecast to 3.2% for 2025, slightly down from its July estimate.¬†

On the bright side, inflation is cooling, expected to fall to 4.3% from 5.8%. Central banks have managed to tame rising prices without triggering recessions.¬†So, cheers to that...sort of.

**Geopolitics: The Wild Card**  
IMF‚Äôs Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it: the risks are piling up. With regional conflicts flaring and protectionism on the rise, global markets could take a hit‚Äîespecially in commodities.¬†

And let‚Äôs not forget global debt, which is on track to hit a jaw-dropping $100 trillion by year-end, mostly thanks to big spenders like the US and China. T

he IMF says governments need to tighten their belts, but with pressures to fund climate initiatives and aging populations, that‚Äôs easier said than done.

**Eurozone Struggles, China Slows**  
The IMF downgraded the Eurozone‚Äôs outlook to 1.2%, mostly due to sluggish manufacturing in Germany and Italy. China didn‚Äôt fare much better‚Äîits growth forecast was slashed too, largely thanks to a shaky real estate market and low consumer confidence.¬†

Though China‚Äôs central bank rolled out some new measures, the IMF isn‚Äôt convinced they‚Äôll do enough to turn the tide. On the flip side, the US is winning the growth race with an upgraded forecast of 2.8%, riding high on strong consumer spending.

**Inflation‚Äôs Almost Beat, But...**  
Even with inflation cooling, the global economy isn‚Äôt exactly cruising. Rising market volatility, geopolitical uncertainties, and the potential for more aggressive monetary policy loom large.¬†

The IMF gave central banks a pat on the back for avoiding a recession, but the road ahead is still filled with potholes. Emerging markets, in particular, are bracing for more turbulence as debt pressures mount.

In short: inflation might be on the retreat, but don't pop the champagne just yet. The IMF‚Äôs forecast is a reality check that the global economy still has a lot of risks to dodge.

# McDonald‚Äôs Quarter Pounder Tied to E. Coli Outbreak

McDonald‚Äôs Quarter Pounder has found itself in hot water after being linked to an E. coli outbreak, which has sickened 49 people across 10 states, leaving one person in Colorado dead.¬†

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flagged slivered onions used in the burger as the likely culprit. McDonald‚Äôs wasted no time, pulling the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in the affected states to contain the outbreak. Talk about a PR nightmare.

**Onion Tears and Bigger Worries**  
It‚Äôs not just the onions making people cry. E. coli O157, the strain in question, can cause some nasty symptoms‚Äîthink severe stomach cramps, and vomiting. Ten people have already been hospitalized, and a child developed a rare complication that can lead to kidney failure.¬†

The CDC is still investigating whether the beef patties or onions are the real issue, but McDonald's is already yanking both from its menu in certain states. Safety first, right?

**D√©j√† Vu for Fast Food?**  
If this sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because Chipotle dealt with a similar E. coli disaster in 2015 that tanked sales and kept customers away for years. McDonald‚Äôs is hoping to avoid that fate by taking ‚Äúswift and decisive action,‚Äù according to Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald‚Äôs USA.¬†

He reassured customers that the Big Mac and other menu staples are still safe to chow down on‚Äîbut for now, the Quarter Pounder is a no-go in several states, including Colorado, Kansas, and Utah.

**The Fallout**  
This outbreak couldn‚Äôt come at a worse time for McDonald‚Äôs, whose US business has already been struggling with inflation-weary customers and slowing sales.¬†

The company‚Äôs shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading as news of the outbreak spread. McDonald‚Äôs has built a reputation on its robust food safety practices, but as history has shown with other chains, foodborne illness outbreaks can be hard to shake off.¬†

McDonald‚Äôs better hope this stays a small fry problem, or it could have a serious mess on its hands.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500?¬†

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That‚Äôs a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman‚Äôs David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market.¬†

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it‚Äôs tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight ‚Äì Oh My!**  
So where‚Äôs the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years‚Äîgiving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that‚Äôs all about the big boys.¬†

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too‚Äîthey tend to do well when the market‚Äôs top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman‚Äôs Gloom**  
Goldman‚Äôs not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade.¬†

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you‚Äôve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find ways to win‚Äîyou just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger‚Äôs replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger‚Äôs retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger‚Äôs successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again.¬†

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn‚Äôt ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates‚Äîboth internal and external. But with Iger‚Äôs direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences‚Äô Josh D‚ÄôAmaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world‚Äôs biggest entertainment companies.

**Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer**  
Disney‚Äôs had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?).¬†

Now, with Gorman steering the board‚Äôs succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman‚Äôs experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster.

Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who‚Äôs stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman‚Äôs outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney‚Äôs board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years.

**Who‚Äôs Next in Line?**  
Four big names are in the running for Disney‚Äôs top job, and they‚Äôve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D‚ÄôAmaro, who oversees Disney‚Äôs theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites.¬†

He‚Äôs got a solid public profile and is leading the company‚Äôs $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back.

Then there‚Äôs Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN‚Äôs sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who‚Äôs deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there‚Äôs always a wildcard‚Äîan outside candidate waiting to swoop in.¬†

For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill.

# Uber Explores Acquiring Expedia

Uber is revving up for a possible detour into the travel industry.¬†

Reports suggest the ride-hailing giant has kicked the tires on acquiring Expedia, though no formal offer is on the table. The deal would be a major play for Uber as it aims to become a ‚Äúsuper app,‚Äù offering everything from rides to takeout to now, potentially, your next vacation.¬†

It‚Äôs no secret that CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has his roots in Expedia, having run the company before moving to Uber‚Äîso a reunion could be on the horizon.

**High Risk, High Reward?**¬†But as intriguing as it sounds, this deal isn‚Äôt without its potholes. Uber‚Äôs stock took a 3% hit after the news broke, while Expedia‚Äôs shares saw a 5% lift. Investors seem torn.¬†

While acquiring Expedia would let Uber gobble up a major slice of the travel pie, it‚Äôs a massive undertaking that could distract the company from its core business‚Äîespecially with autonomous vehicles looming on the horizon.

**The Expedia Factor:**¬†For Expedia, teaming up with Uber could offer a much-needed boost. The travel giant has faced stiff competition from rivals like Booking and Airbnb, and an Uber-sized partnership might help it recover market share.¬†

With the travel industry still in a post-pandemic shuffle, aligning with a booming tech company could give Expedia the edge it needs.

**Super App Ambitions ‚Äî**¬†Still, for Uber, this could be the big leap toward becoming a one-stop shop for all things life-related. Imagine booking a flight, a hotel, and an Uber ride to the airport all in one app. The idea has its appeal, but analysts are cautious, suggesting partnerships might be a safer bet.¬†

After all, integrating Expedia‚Äôs vast network of services could be like trying to merge two freeway systems‚Äîcomplicated and filled with potential roadblocks.

# Tesla Faces Investigation Of ‚ÄòFull Self-Driving‚Äô After Fatal Collision

Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) system just found itself under the federal microscope.¬†

After a fatal pedestrian crash involving a Tesla Model Y, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into whether Tesla‚Äôs FSD can handle tricky visibility situations like fog and sun glare. With four similar crashes on record, things aren't exactly cruising for Tesla‚Äôs autonomous ambitions.

**Fog, Glare, and Red Flags:**¬†This isn‚Äôt Tesla‚Äôs first run-in with regulators. The NHTSA is already digging into Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot system, which has its own laundry list of incidents.¬†

Now, FSD‚Äîdesigned to eventually make driving hands-free‚Äîfaces questions about whether it's safe for real-world use, especially when the weather doesn‚Äôt play nice. Oh, and by the way, 2.4 million Tesla vehicles are now under the investigation spotlight.

**Investors Tap the Brakes:**¬†Tesla's stock took a slight dip after the news broke, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why. Just last week, Elon Musk hyped up plans for driverless robotaxis, but the lack of juicy details left investors unimpressed.¬†

Now, with this probe looming over FSD, Tesla's road to fully autonomous vehicles could hit more than a few potholes.

**A Bumpy Ride Ahead?**¬†Musk has been promising true driverless tech for years, but reality keeps hitting back. With regulators now sniffing around, Tesla‚Äôs timeline for unsupervised FSD looks a lot fuzzier.¬†

The big question: can Tesla steer through this storm, or will it find itself stalled at the side of the road?

# üé∂¬†Starships Were¬†Meant¬†To¬†Fly¬†Be Caught

SpaceX just pulled off a literal grab for the history books. During Sunday‚Äôs Starship test, the Super Heavy booster returned to Earth and was¬†*caught*¬†by giant ""chopstick"" arms attached to the launch tower.¬†

This first-of-its-kind move is another step toward making space travel more reusable and cost-effective, a goal that Elon Musk has been chasing like a kid after ice cream on a hot day.

It was a picture-perfect flight: The Super Heavy booster detached from Starship at an altitude of about 40 miles, did a U-turn, and headed back to the launchpad. Instead of landing on legs, like SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rockets, it steered into the waiting arms of the chopsticks. Cue the cheers at mission control.

**Why It Matters**  
Reusability has always been SpaceX‚Äôs secret sauce. Traditional rockets? One and done. But Musk has been adamant that rockets should be like airplanes‚Äîyou don‚Äôt throw them away after one trip. By catching the booster, SpaceX moves closer to making rapid, low-cost space launches a reality.¬†

This isn‚Äôt just about saving money‚Äîit‚Äôs a crucial step toward launching multiple missions in a single day.

This booster recovery milestone is also a win for NASA, which is banking on Starship to land humans on the Moon by 2026 as part of its Artemis mission. With Sunday‚Äôs success, SpaceX is proving that its reusable rocket tech isn‚Äôt just sci-fi fantasy anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs happening.

**Eyes on Mars**  
But don‚Äôt think Musk is stopping at the Moon. His ultimate goal? Sending humans to Mars. SpaceX has its sights set on launching five uncrewed Starship missions to the red planet in the next two years. Each test, like Sunday‚Äôs catch, brings Musk closer to making that dream a reality.¬†

So, while the Super Heavy booster‚Äôs flawless return is impressive, it‚Äôs just the beginning of SpaceX‚Äôs larger cosmic ambitions.



# Market Movements

* **üíª¬†Nvidia Hits Record High Amid AI Chip Demand:** Nvidia ($NVDA) closed at a record high of $138.07 as demand for its AI chips continues to surge,¬†with major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google purchasing its GPUs in large quantities. Nvidia's market cap now exceeds $3.4 trillion, making it the second-most valuable publicly traded U.S. company after Apple.
* üè¶¬†**Fed Governor Waller Urges Caution on Future Rate Cuts:** Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller¬†signaled that future interest rate cuts will be less aggressive¬†than the previous 50 basis point reduction in September. Citing stronger-than-expected employment, inflation, and GDP data, Waller emphasized a more cautious approach moving forward as the economy may not be slowing as anticipated.
* **üîã¬†Google Signs Deal with Kairos Power for Nuclear Energy:** Google ($GOOGL) has inked a deal with¬†Kairos Power to purchase power from small modular reactors¬†(SMRs) as part of its efforts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. The first reactor is expected to come online by 2030, with more following by 2035, adding 500 megawatts to the grid.
* **üìª¬†Berkshire Hathaway Increases Stake in SiriusXM:** Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway¬†raised its stake in SiriusXM ($SIRI) to 32%¬†following a recent deal by Liberty Media.

# Earning‚Äôs Season Is Here

Earnings season is upon us, and after a $9 trillion rally, 2024‚Äôs bullish run faces a reality check. Analysts are calling for just a 4.3% profit bump for the S&P 500 this quarter‚Äîthe weakest growth we‚Äôve seen in a year. Expectations have been on a diet, too: Back in June, experts were predicting a solid 8.4% rise.¬†

But don't lose hope just yet‚Äîthis is Wall Street, where surprises lurk around every corner. Remember the first quarter when projections were bleak but profits soared 7.9%?

Despite the low bar, the S&P 500 has been climbing like it‚Äôs auditioning for an action movie, hitting fresh highs and clocking a 22% gain in 2024 so far. It's the best start since 1997, and some investors are betting this could lead to an earnings surprise, just like earlier this year. The optimists might just have a point.

**The AI Party Slows Down**  
Speaking of action movies, the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants‚ÄîApple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla‚Äîare still the stars of the earnings show. Together, they‚Äôre expected to post an 18% profit rise, but don‚Äôt get too excited: their growth rate is slowing. They were churning out over 30% increases last year, but this quarter, the AI-fueled party is looking a little more low-key.

For the rest of the S&P 500, it‚Äôs a bit of a grind. Profits outside of the tech bubble are set to rise just 1.8%. But hey, a win‚Äôs a win, right? And looking ahead, analysts expect much stronger numbers in early 2025, with double-digit growth on the horizon.

**A Stock Picker‚Äôs Playground**  
Here‚Äôs where things get spicy: this could be a¬†*stock picker‚Äôs*¬†paradise. While overall market volatility is snoozing, individual stocks are gearing up for some wild moves. Bank of America‚Äôs data shows that post-earnings swings could be the biggest since 2021, so if you can spot the winners and losers, you might just walk away with a big payout.¬†

Tech, communication services, and healthcare stocks are expected to shine, while energy stocks may take a hit as crude prices slide.

**Margin Watch and Election Talk**  
As earnings trickle in, one thing everyone will be keeping an eye on is profit margins. The forecast? A slight dip to 12.9% from last quarter‚Äôs 13.1%, as companies face rising input costs. But don‚Äôt sweat it too much‚Äîmargins are expected to rebound soon enough.

Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget about politics. With the U.S. presidential election around the corner, corporate America is getting nervous. Mentions of ""election"" on earnings calls are up 62% from four years ago, and history suggests investment could take a breather until the dust settles.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season kicks off tomorrow, and it‚Äôs poised to send some ripples through the markets. With big reports from key players set to roll in, investors are gearing up for what could be a pivotal moment. Expect some surprises and volatility as the numbers start to drop‚Äîthis is when things get interesting.

# Before Market Open:

* Warren Buffett seems to be cooling on¬†**Bank of America**¬†($BAC), offloading shares consistently for months. While that‚Äôs hardly a confidence booster, shareholders shouldn‚Äôt panic just yet. Interest rate cuts and AI developments could still bolster the bank‚Äôs long-term outlook. Plus, recent earnings from major banks signal stronger net interest income across the board. Analysts are expecting $0.77 EPS on $25.31 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile,¬†**Albertsons Companies**¬†($ACI) has left investors anxiously awaiting news on its potential merger with Kroger. The deal has been in the works for two years, but even if it falls through, Albertsons remains a strong player in the grocery space. With same-store sales growth and widening profit margins, the company should continue to hold its own. The consensus? $0.48 EPS and $18.47 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **United Airlines**¬†($UAL) might not seem like a top pick given the turbulence the airline industry has faced lately‚Äîthink major IT outages and struggling competitors. But United has managed to rise above the chaos. If Delta‚Äôs performance is any indication (despite the impact of CrowdStrike‚Äôs toll on the sector), United is likely to stay on course. Analysts remain optimistic. The consensus? $3.07 EPS and $14.78 billion in revenue.",10-14-2024
"Stock Market Today: JPMorgan Chase & Wells Fargo Earnings + Tesla Shares Sink After Musk‚Äôs Robotaxi Unveiling Disappoints# MARKETS¬†

* The Dow and S&P 500 hit fresh highs on Friday, with the S&P cracking 5,800 for the first time, powered by strong earnings from U.S. banks. The Dow jumped nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.3%. All three major indexes closed the first full week of October with gains of over 1%.
* Wall Street kicked off earnings season on a high note as early reports from big banks reassured investors. Despite concerns about the impact of rate cuts, strong earnings across the financial sector signaled resilience driving overall market optimism.

# Winners & Losers

# What‚Äôs up¬†üìà

* **Affirm**¬†($AFRM) surged 12.07% after Wells Fargo analysts upgraded the buy now, pay later company, citing its expanding collaboration with Apple Pay as a key growth driver.
* **Uber**¬†($UBER) gained 10.81% after Tesla's robotaxi event fell short of investor expectations, as analysts pointed out the lack of clarity on how Tesla plans to compete against ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber.
* **Fastenal**¬†($FAST) climbed 9.76% after the construction and hardware equipment manufacturer delivered stronger-than-expected revenue, exceeding analysts' forecasts for the last quarter.
* **Lyft**¬†($LYFT) surged 9.59% as Tesla's robotaxi event provided a boost to ride-sharing companies, with investors favoring Lyft's established position in the market.
* **Bank of America**¬†($BAC) rose 4.95%, even after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cut its stake in the bank below 10%. Despite Berkshire's sale of over 9.5 million shares, the stock gained on investor optimism.
* **JPMorgan Chase**¬†($JPM) climbed 4.44% after posting third-quarter results that exceeded profit and revenue estimates. The bank's strong performance was driven by higher-than-expected interest income, though profit fell 2% year-over-year while revenue increased by 6%.
* **Boeing**¬†($BA) increased 3.00%, despite announcing plans to slash 10% of its workforce, about 17,000 jobs, due to accumulating losses during a factory strike.

# What‚Äôs down¬†üìâ

* **Tesla**¬†($TSLA) fell 8.78% after its robotaxi event underwhelmed investors. Morgan Stanley analysts noted the event ""disappointed expectations,"" citing a lack of details about how Tesla plans to compete with ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber.
* **A.O. Smith**¬†($AOS) sank 6.25% after cutting its full-year outlook due to lower-than-expected sales.
* **Align Technology**¬†($ALGN) declined 3.31% after Stifel lowered its price target on the company's stock, reflecting concerns about future performance.
* **Stellantis**¬†($STLA) dropped 2.22% after announcing that its CEO will step down in early 2026.
* **Flutter**¬†($FLUT) also dropped 8.78%.

# 

# JPMorgan Chase & Wells Fargo Earnings

JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) kicked off the earnings season with a surprise: net interest income (NII) rose 3%, beating expectations. The bank raised its full-year NII forecast to $92.5 billion, signaling resilience even as analysts predicted a rate-cut-driven decline. Investment banking also saw a 31% surge, well above the 16% expected.

But Jamie Dimon didn‚Äôt let the good news linger‚Äîhe quickly shifted focus to the darker side, warning that geopolitics are ‚Äútreacherous and getting worse.‚Äù

**Wells Fargo Joins the Earnings Party**  
Not to be outdone, Wells Fargo ($WFC) also posted stronger-than-expected results, buoyed by a 37% leap in investment-banking fees. While the bank‚Äôs net income slipped 11% due to higher deposit costs, it still beat analyst expectations, driving a 5% stock jump. CEO Charlie Scharf has been aggressively expanding the bank‚Äôs investment banking arm, and it seems to be paying off‚Äîat least for now.

**Credit Concerns Lurk:**¬†Despite the strong quarter, JPMorgan‚Äôs credit-card unit raised some red flags. Loan losses hit $3.11 billion, mostly tied to consumer credit cards, as the bank braces for higher defaults.¬†

Dimon didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it: 2025 NII will likely come in lower, and deposit balances have started to shrink. Wells Fargo echoed similar concerns, noting that lower-income customers are feeling more financial pressure, which could weigh on future lending profits.

**Looking Ahead, Caution Reigns:**¬†Both banks‚Äô strong Q3 showings offered a glimmer of optimism, but there‚Äôs still plenty of caution in the air. Dimon‚Äôs warnings about geopolitical risks and fiscal challenges loom large, while Wells Fargo is preparing for continued pressure on net interest income.¬†

The takeaway? Banks are navigating the current environment well, but the road ahead may be bumpier than these earnings suggest.

# Tesla Shares Sink After Musk‚Äôs Robotaxi Unveiling Disappoints

Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi debut didn‚Äôt exactly electrify investors. At a highly anticipated event, Elon Musk showed off the Cybercab, a futuristic two-seater, and the Robovan, capable of transporting 20 passengers. But beyond the sleek designs, the presentation was light on the critical details‚Äîlike how Tesla plans to leap from driver-assistance technology to full autonomy.¬†

As a result, Tesla's stock took a hit, sliding 8.8% and wiping out $67 billion in market value.

**All Hype, No Timelines**  
Musk dangled the prospect of a $30,000 Cybercab hitting production by 2026, but investors have heard lofty promises before. Remember when a million robotaxis were supposed to be on the road by 2020?¬†

Fast forward to today, and we still haven‚Äôt seen a single one. The event glossed over key details like regulatory hurdles, safety protocols, or whether Tesla would run its own fleet. Analysts were left wanting more, with many calling the reveal more sizzle than steak.

**Uber and Lyft Take a Victory Lap:**¬†Tesla‚Äôs stumble became a win for competitors Uber and Lyft, whose stocks soared by about 10%. With no real timeline for fully autonomous cars from Tesla, ride-hailing companies seem to have dodged a bullet‚Äîat least for now.¬†

Investors looking for concrete steps toward a self-driving future were left scratching their heads, as Tesla‚Äôs track record of missing deadlines looms large.

**Bold Vision, Bigger Questions**  
Musk painted a utopian future of robotaxis erasing parking lots and traffic jams, but the path to get there is anything but clear. Investors are skeptical about Tesla‚Äôs ability to overcome regulatory roadblocks, liability issues, and technical challenges. With no functional demo or detailed roadmap, the robotaxi remains a concept rather than a reality.¬†

For now, Tesla‚Äôs bold vision of a driverless future is still more dream than execution.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Monday is a federal holiday, which means the bond market is taking the day off. The stock market? Still open, but don't expect any fireworks‚Äîmost investors are clocking out for a long weekend, so no big earnings or economic reports are on deck.

This week is pretty much a snooze fest for economic data. Tuesday and Wednesday won‚Äôt move the needle much, but Thursday is where things get interesting with initial jobless claims, US retail sales, and the Home Builder Confidence Index. By Friday, we'll be diving into more housing numbers with housing starts and building permits.

But while the data‚Äôs on pause, earnings season is about to kick into high gear, so get ready for a flood of reports to shake things up.

"How to find upcoming stock events?Hi everyone,

This may seem like a stupid question but does anyone know any good sources to find upcoming events for a company? I'm an options trader and took a credit spread trade on Tesla and uber this week. All was going well until Tesla announced the CyberCab at their auto show event and the stock tanked 10% overnight - totally ruining my spread. As a result investors shifted their money to competitors like Uber and that jumped 8% over night - also destroying my play there.

My problem is that I did not know about this auto show and was not able to find out about it until after it happened. I took these trades because I initially thought there wasn't much going on this week and the stocks would most likely trade sideways. I don't mind taking risks just as long as I know what the risks are, but I got blindsided by this one. 

My question is, how do you find out about upcoming events like this? Are there any good resources you guys use to stay up-to-date? I want to make sure I know all the variables next time I take a trade.

Thanks",10-11-2024
"TAXES - OMG! HelpI day traded a single sock - Tesla all year last year (2023), early in the year I was up like $300k and then I ended the year with a loss. But due to wash sales my taxes are stating I owe the IRS $68k in taxes even though overall I lost money. So not only did I lose money on my tades but now I have to pay taxes on top of this. I have called multiple CPA's & a tax lawyer today and it is looking bleak.

I do not have Mark-To-Market day trading statues, I think that is where I messed up bigly.

Help anyone, I am in bad place - anyone know of a way to help

**What I have learned: As far as I have been able to determine, you have to pay the IRS on even if your total profit is negative for the year due to wash-sale rules. I now wish I had gotten ""Mark-To-Market"" trading status.**",10-11-2024

# Tesla‚Äôs Robotaxi Day Is Upon Us After A Decade Of Promises

Elon Musk, never one to shy away from grand promises, is gearing up for Tesla‚Äôs biggest reveal since the Model 3.¬†Tonight at¬†7 p.m. Pacific¬†(10 p.m. Eastern),¬†the long-awaited robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, will make its debut at Warner Bros. studios.¬†For those tuning in, the event will be livestreamed on Musk‚Äôs¬†X platform¬†(formerly known as Twitter).

For Musk, this is more than just a new car‚Äîit‚Äôs a pivot toward AI and robotics that he believes could propel Tesla‚Äôs value to $30 trillion (yes, trillion). But as history has shown, Musk‚Äôs lofty ambitions often come with missed deadlines, so investors are cautiously optimistic.

**Can Tesla Go Driverless?**  
The hype is real, and Tesla‚Äôs stock has surged 52% since the event was announced. But skeptics are quick to remind everyone that Musk has been teasing the robotaxi concept since 2016, with little to show for it. While Waymo already has driverless cars cruising around cities like San Francisco and Phoenix, Tesla‚Äôs autonomous tech still requires human oversight.¬†

The big question: Can Tesla leapfrog its competitors and actually deliver on the promise of a fully autonomous vehicle?

**All Eyes on the Cybercab**  
Musk has called tonight‚Äôs event ‚Äúone for the history books.‚Äù The Cybercab, expected to be a sleek, two-seater without a steering wheel, could launch Tesla into new territory. However, the road ahead is bumpy.¬†

Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) software still isn‚Äôt fully autonomous, and regulatory hurdles are a massive roadblock. While Waymo is already operational in select cities, Tesla will need to convince regulators and investors that its tech is ready for primetime.

**High Hopes, Big Risks**  
Analysts are split. Bulls see the robotaxi as a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, potentially adding $4 billion in sales by 2030. Skeptics, on the other hand, point to Musk‚Äôs track record of overpromising and under-delivering. If tonight‚Äôs event doesn‚Äôt meet expectations, it could deal a blow to Tesla‚Äôs stock, which is already down nearly 40% from its peak.¬†

But if Musk pulls it off? Tesla might just shift into the next gear, leaving competitors in the dust.

# AMD Launches AI Chip To Rival Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) has been hot on Nvidia‚Äôs trail, trying to stake its claim in the booming artificial intelligence chip market. On Thursday, AMD revealed its newest AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, at an event in San Francisco. While CEO Lisa Su boasted about the chip's edge over Nvidia‚Äôs H100, investors were left wanting more.¬†

AMD‚Äôs stock slid 4% after the event, its steepest drop in over a month, as key details about customers and financial performance remained elusive.

**The AI Chip Race Heats Up**  
With Nvidia dominating the AI accelerator market, AMD is in catch-up mode. Su claims the MI325X, with its new high-bandwidth memory, offers better AI inference performance.¬†

But here‚Äôs the catch: Nvidia‚Äôs upcoming Blackwell chips, set to ship next year, could leave AMD‚Äôs latest chip in the dust. Investors have been eagerly waiting for AMD to prove it can chip away at Nvidia‚Äôs market share, but Thursday‚Äôs event fell short of the expected breakthrough.

**Growing Market, Fierce Competition**  
AMD is playing the long game, forecasting the AI chip market to hit $500 billion by 2028. While the company is making strides in AI, capturing just 34% of the market for server CPUs, Nvidia remains the top dog with over 90% of the data center AI chip market.¬†

And while AMD‚Äôs AI accelerators have potential, the widespread use of Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA programming language continues to lock developers into the Nvidia ecosystem, making it harder for AMD to gain traction.

**Looking Ahead:**¬†AMD has ambitious plans, unveiling its next-generation MI350 GPU series, set to arrive in 2025 with a whopping 35 times more performance than its predecessors. But by then, Nvidia may have already one-upped AMD with newer, more powerful GPUs.¬†

Investors are keeping a close watch on whether AMD can deliver on its promises and grab a bigger slice of the AI pie, but for now, Nvidia still holds the upper hand.

# The DOJ Wants To Break Up Google‚Äôs Monopoly

Google's monopoly reign might be facing its toughest challenge yet. The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) is weighing a move that could break up the tech titan after a judge ruled it unlawfully dominated search and ad markets.¬†

In a court filing, the DOJ proposed everything from breaking off pieces of Google‚Äôs business (think Chrome and Android) to forcing the company to share its search data with competitors. It‚Äôs a bold step that echoes the antitrust battles of the early 2000s‚Ä¶remember Microsoft?

Not surprisingly, Google isn‚Äôt too thrilled. The company called the DOJ‚Äôs plan ""radical"" and warned that messing with its business model could have unintended consequences, like fewer free services for users. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares slid 1.6% on the news‚Äîcue the market jitters.

**Tech Titans Under the Microscope**  
Google‚Äôs not the only one sweating right now. Almost half of the S&P 500, including big names like Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon, are in antitrust hot water too. Regulators are accusing them of crushing competition and monopolizing key markets.¬†

But, despite these lawsuits, Big Tech‚Äôs still living its best life, with stock prices climbing thanks to AI innovation.

The DOJ‚Äôs real focus? The future of search, especially with AI on the rise. They want to prevent Google from flexing its dominance as AI-powered search tools become the norm. Regulators are thinking long-term here, trying to stop Google from maintaining its stranglehold in the tech space.

**The Long Legal Road Ahead**  
Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled Google was guilty of monopolistic behavior, now has to decide what to do about it. The DOJ‚Äôs suggested remedies range from ‚Äújust change your behavior‚Äù to ‚Äútime to break up the band.‚Äù¬†

While some experts think a breakup is unlikely (at least anytime soon), this legal battle is far from over. Google‚Äôs going to fight, and they‚Äôre likely to appeal any decisions not in their favor.

**The Big Picture:**¬†Despite the legal storm, analysts aren‚Äôt losing sleep over it. Tech stocks have been riding high, with investors more interested in earnings and product launches than courtroom drama. For now, it‚Äôs business as usual, but if the DOJ really manages to pull off a Google breakup? Well, that could be a game-changer.

# WeightWatchers To Offer Compounded GLP-1 Weight-Loss Drugs

WeightWatchers just jumped into the weight-loss drug game with a twist. The company announced it‚Äôll start offering a compounded version of Wegovy (aka a cheaper knockoff) after facing shortages of the real deal.¬†

At $129 for the first month and $189 thereafter, it‚Äôs a far cry from the $1,300 price tag of branded options like Ozempic. Naturally, the stock shot up by nearly 47% on the news.

But the real question is‚Äîhow long can this ride last?

**It‚Äôs Getting Crowded in Here**  
WeightWatchers is showing up a bit late to the knockoff Wegovy party, where companies like Hims & Hers and Noom have been hanging out for months. But what WeightWatchers brings to the table is its bread-and-butter combo of behavioral coaching and clinical support.¬†

So, it‚Äôs not just about the drugs‚Äîit‚Äôs about changing the whole lifestyle.

Still, the FDA is cracking down. They‚Äôve already removed drugs like Mounjaro from the shortage list, which means compounded versions could disappear fast. For now, semaglutide (the magic behind Wegovy and Ozempic) remains in short supply, so WeightWatchers might still have time to carve out its slice of the market.

**WeightWatchers' Identity Crisis**  
This move comes at a shaky time for WeightWatchers. They‚Äôve had a rough year, with their stock losing more than 90% of its value. Plus, CEO Sima Sistani exited stage left just two weeks ago, and Oprah‚Äîyes,¬†*the*¬†Oprah‚Äîditched the board earlier this year after admitting she‚Äôs been on weight-loss meds herself. Yikes.

But interim CEO Tara Comonte is trying to steer the ship by banking on this drug offering, even as the weight-loss world shifts away from the traditional ""dieting"" approach that WeightWatchers has been known for.

**Can They Keep the Momentum?:**¬†The stock surge suggests investors like what they‚Äôre seeing for now, but the weight-loss landscape is getting tougher by the day. With FDA regulations tightening and plenty of competitors already in the game, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how long WeightWatchers can keep riding this wave.

# Tomorrow

The weekly initial jobless claims report is here again, and all eyes are on it, especially with the Fed‚Äôs focus on the labor market as it charts the course for future rate cuts.

However, tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report is set to steal the spotlight. CPI tracks the monthly price shifts in goods that Americans buy, making it a crucial measure of inflation. Economists predict a 2.3% annual increase in September‚Äôs CPI, up from August‚Äôs 2.1%, while core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to hold steady at 3.2%. If these numbers hold, the Fed may feel more confident about proceeding with rate cuts. But any surprises could throw a wrench in those plans, keeping investors on edge.

# Activist Investor Starboard Value Takes $1 Billion Stake in Pfizer

It's the classic tale of a corporate shake-up: missed targets, mounting investor frustration, and then the activists come knocking on your door. Starboard Value, helmed by the ""most feared man in corporate America"" Jeff Smith, has just taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer, seeking to revive the pharmaceutical giant's fortunes.

Pfizer's stock rose 2.12% on the news but remains down 1.83% for 2024‚Äîa stark contrast to the S&P 500's 20% climb this year.

**A Pandemic Peak and a Post-Covid Slump**  
Pfizer's pandemic glory days seem like a distant memory. During the peak, the company became a household name thanks to its record-breaking vaccine rollout. Revenues skyrocketed from $42 billion in 2020 to $100 billion in 2022. But as the world returned to normal, demand for its Covid-19 products took a nosedive.

The problem? Pfizer's other offerings couldn't pick up the slack. Even its much-hyped anti-obesity drug flopped, leaving the pharma giant without a clear path forward.

CEO Albert Bourla went on a spending spree during the pandemic‚Äînearly $70 billion in acquisitions since 2020‚Äîwhile also boosting Pfizer's R&D budget. Despite these efforts, results have been underwhelming.

Just this month, Pfizer had to pull a sickle cell drug it acquired for $5 billion. Another setback in its acquisition-heavy growth strategy.

**Reuniting with the Old Guard**  
Now, Starboard is looking to bring back some familiar faces: ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio. Both have expressed interest in returning to help steady the ship, according to reports.

Under Read's leadership from 2010 to 2018, Pfizer had a more focused approach, zeroing in on core businesses like vaccines and cancer. Starboard seems to hope that a dose of the old guard's discipline can turn things around.

Pfizer has already started reining in spending, with a $4 billion cost-cutting program announced last year. But it hasn't been enough to lift the company out of its post-pandemic slump.

Maybe Starboard's intervention, paired with a reunion of past leaders, can help Pfizer regain its lost momentum‚Äîor at least give the stock a much-needed shot in the arm.

# Google Play Must Allow Rival Android App Stores, Judge Rules

Big news in the tech world: a federal judge has ordered Google to loosen its grip on the Android app market. Starting November, the tech giant must allow rival app stores to compete more freely with Google Play‚Äîa move that could reshape how apps are distributed across Android devices.

The ruling comes after Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, scored a significant victory in its long-standing antitrust battle against Google. The judge concluded that Google abused its power by restricting developers and creating barriers for competing app stores.

Now, for the next three years, Google can't force developers to exclusively use its app store or its billing features. Rival stores will also get a shot at accessing Google's app catalog.

**Antitrust Pressure Mounts**  
The court's decision is the latest blow in Google's ongoing struggle with antitrust authorities. Just this August, the search giant lost another major case over claims that it monopolized online search and advertising markets. The pressure on Google keeps mounting, and it's not just in the U.S.‚Äîregulators worldwide are eyeing similar app store practices.

Judge James Donato, who issued the ruling, made it clear that his aim is to restore fair competition. Google will have to let developers tell customers about alternative ways to download apps, allow rival stores to have access to its platform, and ensure that app developers aren't forced to use Google's billing services.

The injunction lasts until 2027, giving competitors time to establish a meaningful presence in the Android ecosystem.

**Epic Games Is Not Done Yet**  
Epic Games, which has had mixed results in a similar lawsuit against Apple, isn‚Äôt backing down. CEO Tim Sweeney took to social media, announcing that Epic will launch its own app store on Android next year. He sees this ruling as a major opportunity for developers, carriers, and app store makers to create a more competitive Android ecosystem.

Google, for its part, is gearing up to appeal. The company insists its practices benefit users by enhancing security and consistency on Android devices. The judge allowed Google to implement ""reasonable measures"" to ensure platform security, but those measures will be under scrutiny by a committee formed by both Epic and Google.

The battle over app stores is far from over.

But one thing is certain: this ruling opens the door for a lot more competition in the Android world.

# Day Trader Turns $306M into Nothing, Sues for Negligence

Classic day-trader tale: a guy, some cash, and Tesla options. For Vancouver Island carpenter Christopher DeVocht, it turned into one of the wildest rides in day-trading history.

By late 2019, DeVocht‚Äôs trading account with RBC Dominion Securities sat at C$88,000. Fast forward two years‚Äîit ballooned to C$415 million ($306 million). Riding high on Tesla options, DeVocht seemed unstoppable. But instead of cashing out, he doubled down, betting everything on Tesla's continued rise. Then came 2022. Tesla‚Äôs stock took a nosedive, and with it, DeVocht‚Äôs massive fortune disappeared‚Äîfrom $306 million to nothing.

Now, DeVocht is suing RBC and accounting firm Grant Thornton for what he calls ""negligent advice."" He claims the guidance he received‚Äîfocused on minimizing taxes‚Äîdidn‚Äôt account for his limited financial know-how. Instead of taking profits, he was advised to concentrate his holdings in Tesla and get tax breaks by forming an investment holding company, leading to disastrous overexposure.

As Tesla‚Äôs stock plunged, DeVocht borrowed millions from a margin account to stay afloat, hoping to recover his losses. He even borrowed C$20 million for shorter-term trades, but that didn‚Äôt work out either. Eventually, the corporation had to sell all Tesla holdings to repay loans, leaving DeVocht empty-handed.

DeVocht insists that with better advice, he wouldn‚Äôt have lost everything. He claims RBC wrongly treated him as a sophisticated investor, and now he‚Äôs seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. He‚Äôs also blaming a recommendation to donate C$25.5 million to charity for adding to his financial woes.

Royal Bank hasn‚Äôt commented, and Grant Thornton says they‚Äôre sticking to professional standards‚Äîwhatever that means in this mess. For now, DeVocht‚Äôs story is a cautionary tale of what happens when day traders get in over their heads without a safety net.

# College students used Meta‚Äôs smart glasses to dox people in real time

Picture this: You‚Äôre on the subway, minding your business, and suddenly someone knows your name, job, and where you live‚Äîall thanks to a pair of smart glasses. Sounds like sci-fi? Not anymore. Two Harvard students recently turned Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban glasses into a real-life doxxing device, and it‚Äôs raising major privacy red flags.

AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio used Meta‚Äôs glasses paired with the facial recognition tool PimEyes to scan strangers and gather personal info, like addresses and job details. In their demo, they even used the data to strike up conversations with unsuspecting people. The glasses streamed video to a laptop, where the real magic‚Äîand invasion of privacy‚Äîhappened. Meta was quick to point out that this wasn‚Äôt built-in tech; it was a hack using publicly available tools. But the glasses‚Äô hands-free, inconspicuous design makes this kind of invasion way too easy.

Big picture: Back in 2021, Meta execs‚Äîincluding current CTO Andrew Bosworth‚Äîactually considered adding facial recognition to these glasses, thinking it could help you remember someone‚Äôs name at a party. The idea got scrapped, probably because of the massive ethical and legal issues. But wearable tech is catching on, and attitudes are shifting. Meta has already sold over 700,000 pairs of these glasses in the last year, despite privacy concerns.

What‚Äôs next? Are we on the path to accepting facial recognition in our everyday tech, or is this a step too far? With smart glasses blending into everyday fashion, it‚Äôs getting harder to tell when you‚Äôre being recorded‚Äîand that‚Äôs what makes this debate so urgent.

The potential for misuse is clear. Imagine someone using these glasses not just for fun, but for malicious purposes‚Äîstalking, harassment, or worse. It‚Äôs a fine line between convenience and invasion, and the ease of combining wearable tech with facial recognition makes it all the more dangerous. While some people might welcome the idea of recognizing acquaintances in public, the risks far outweigh the benefits for many.

Tech companies like Meta must tread carefully. Privacy laws in places like Illinois, Texas, and the European Union already restrict certain uses of facial recognition, but technology often moves faster than regulation. For now, the responsibility falls on both companies and consumers to use these powerful tools ethically‚Äîand to push back when the line between helpful and harmful gets crossed.

# Next Week

After a calm stretch, get ready for a packed week. The big headline? Thursday‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will serve as a key gauge for inflation and the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight to bring prices down. If inflation shows signs of cooling, expect markets to cheer. But if the report disappoints, more volatility could be on the horizon.

Before that, Tuesday kicks off with the NFIB optimism index, giving insight into small business sentiment‚Äîa vital metric since small businesses make up nearly half of U.S. GDP. Then, on Wednesday, we‚Äôll get a look at wholesale inventories, a key factor for understanding the pace of manufacturing and GDP growth.

Thursday isn‚Äôt just about CPI‚Äîweekly jobless claims will also roll in, giving an update on the labor market. And to finish the week strong, Friday‚Äôs Producer Price Index (PPI) will provide an early look at inflation from the perspective of manufacturers, followed by earnings reports from JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, signaling the start of a new earnings season.

As if that weren‚Äôt enough, we‚Äôll also hear from nine Federal Reserve officials throughout the week. Wall Street will be analyzing their every word for hints of what‚Äôs to come in monetary policy.

Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) is running out of fuel‚Äîfinancially speaking. After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It‚Äôs not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses.

Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthe options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue‚Äôs coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations.

With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit‚Äôs balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking‚ÄîSpirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit‚Äôs credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes.

**A Rocky Ride**  
Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher.

Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies.

With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring.

# OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion at $157 Billion Valuation

Call OpenAI the Silicon Valley darling‚Äîthis AI powerhouse just scored $6.6 billion in fresh funding, catapulting its valuation to a staggering $157 billion. Thrive Capital, led by Josh Kushner, took the lead with a $1.3 billion investment, while Microsoft‚ÄîOpenAI‚Äôs most dedicated cheerleader‚Äîadded another $750 million to its $13 billion pile. Other heavy hitters like Khosla Ventures, Fidelity, Nvidia, and SoftBank couldn't resist jumping on the AI hype train.

With this cash infusion, OpenAI is officially rubbing shoulders with the elite‚Äîjoining the ranks of the top three venture-backed startups, alongside SpaceX and TikTok‚Äôs parent, ByteDance. But it‚Äôs not just about the dollars; it‚Äôs about strategy. OpenAI is playing it smart by keeping rivals at bay‚Äîasking investors to steer clear of backing competitors like Anthropic and Musk's xAI. Staying on top isn‚Äôt just about innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about making sure others don‚Äôt catch up.

**Fueling the AI Dream**  
This new funding will power more AI research and expand computing capacity, keeping OpenAI at the forefront of the field. Their star attraction, ChatGPT, now flaunts 250 million weekly active users. But there‚Äôs a price to pay‚ÄîOpenAI expects to burn through $5 billion this year against $3.7 billion in revenue. Developing next-level AI tech isn‚Äôt exactly a budget-friendly hobby.

OpenAI‚Äôs internal shakeups have added to the drama. CEO Sam Altman got the boot and then came back like a Silicon Valley comeback story. Plus, key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati have exited, stirring uncertainty. There‚Äôs also talk of ditching the nonprofit label for a for-profit model‚Äîa move that makes investors giddy but could come with its own set of legal headaches.

**Zoom Out**  
AI is more than just cool tech‚Äîit‚Äôs a battleground, and OpenAI is right in the thick of it. Heavyweights like Google and Meta are breathing down its neck, while new challengers are cropping up everywhere. With a potential IPO on the horizon, Sam Altman and his team are betting big on their vision‚Äîand their capital.

Buckle up, because the AI race just went into overdrive.

Brace yourselves‚Äîtomorrow‚Äôs jobs report is shaping up to be a big one. Ever since July‚Äôs job data tanked the market, investors have been glued to these reports.

# Toyota Doubles Down on Flying Taxis¬†

Toyota‚Äôs getting ready for liftoff‚Äîliterally. The car giant is pumping an additional $500 million into Joby Aviation ($JOBY), the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company that‚Äôs turning the flying taxi dream into a reality. This latest investment brings Toyota‚Äôs total stake in Joby to a cool $894 million, and it‚Äôs all part of a plan to ramp up commercial production of these futuristic air taxis by 2025.

Joby‚Äôs stock skyrocketed as much as 21% on the news, reminding everyone that the future of commuting might just be airborne.

**So, What‚Äôs the Buzz with Joby?**  
Joby isn‚Äôt your average startup‚Äîit‚Äôs a leader in the eVTOL space, which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Translation: these are fully electric aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter but fly more efficiently like a plane. Powered by batteries, Joby‚Äôs aircraft are designed to whisk passengers over short distances, dodging traffic and cutting down travel time.

Imagine hopping into an air taxi and flying across town, all without worrying about traffic jams. That‚Äôs the future Joby‚Äôs working on, and they‚Äôre planning to launch their first commercial service in Dubai as soon as next year. However, they still need approval from the FAA and other regulators before this tech can really take off.

**A Match Made in the Sky**  
Toyota‚Äôs been in Joby‚Äôs corner since 2020, providing both funding and engineering expertise. The carmaker isn‚Äôt just throwing money at the problem; its engineers are working side-by-side with Joby to help streamline the aircraft‚Äôs manufacturing process. And Toyota isn‚Äôt new to tech gambles‚Äîthey‚Äôve been diving into everything from hydrogen-powered cars to autonomous driving. Now, air taxis are their next big bet.

Joby‚Äôs tech is seriously cool. Their eVTOL aircraft are nearly silent during flight and can carry four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph. With a range of 150 miles on a single charge, they‚Äôre aiming to revolutionize urban mobility‚Äîno more bumper-to-bumper gridlock.

**Flying into the Future**  
The investment underscores how serious Toyota is about diversifying into futuristic modes of transportation. Joby‚Äôs aircraft could one day be the go-to for zipping from city to city or quickly hopping between airports, avoiding the dreaded rush-hour gridlock. But before you can book your flying Uber, there are hurdles like certification and public acceptance to overcome. Still, Joby has raised over $2 billion and is one of the few companies in the eVTOL space that‚Äôs well-funded enough to bring its vision to life.

With this cash infusion, Joby is poised to scale up production, and Toyota‚Äôs backing will play a key role in helping the startup take off‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

# Tesla's Q3 Deliveries Hits a Bump

Tesla just posted its first quarterly sales increase of 2024, but don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet. Deliveries were up 6.4%, hitting 462,890 vehicles in Q3. Sounds good, right? Not exactly. Wall Street was hoping for more, especially after all the hype around China‚Äôs boosted EV subsidies. Analysts expected closer to 463,900. So, close but no cigar.

And Tesla‚Äôs stock? It dropped 3.5%‚Äîbecause investors don‚Äôt like being teased.

**China to the Rescue‚Ä¶ Sort of**  
China threw Tesla a bone with incentives aimed at spurring electric car demand, but even that couldn‚Äôt push deliveries over the finish line. Investors had been riding high on expectations, especially with Musk teasing an October 10th event to show off his long-promised robotaxis. Elon even called it ‚Äúone for the history books‚Äù (because of course he does).

But promises can only get you so far. Tesla‚Äôs shares had rallied 35% in the last two months, but this miss reminded everyone that not all that glitters is gold‚Äîor, in this case, electric.

**Tough Road Ahead**  
Tesla‚Äôs not just battling its delivery numbers; it‚Äôs wrestling with stiffer competition and customers‚Äô shrinking wallets, thanks to high interest rates. Sure, vehicle sales inched up, but Tesla‚Äôs energy business? Not so much. Energy storage took a nosedive, dropping 25% from Q2. Ouch.

If Tesla wants to hit its goal of selling 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, it‚Äôs going to need a massive Q4. And we‚Äôre talking¬†*massive.*

October 23rd is the next big date for Tesla‚Äôs Q3 earnings report‚Äîwhere everyone will be watching to see if Musk can pull off a fourth-quarter miracle.

# Iran Sends a Message... and Missiles

In a not-so-subtle move, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves across both the Middle East and global markets. The attack comes hot on the heels of Israel‚Äôs targeted killings of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, including the dramatic airstrike that took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, never one to shy away from a response, promised swift retaliation.

""Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it,"" Netanyahu stated.

Markets Feel the Heat  
This missile barrage didn't just light up the night sky ‚Äì it sent oil prices soaring over 5% as investors braced for potential supply disruptions. Global stock markets, already jittery, took a hit, with major indices retreating as traders sought safety in bonds and gold. The Dow dropped over 250 points, while oil bulls celebrated the sudden spike in WTI crude prices.

The Middle East remains a powder keg, and this latest escalation between Iran and Israel has made energy traders reach for their helmets.

Defensive Maneuvers  
Most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel‚Äôs vaunted defense systems (with a little help from the U.S.), but a few managed to slip through. While the immediate damage was minimal, Netanyahu made it clear that Israel wouldn‚Äôt just let this slide. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden got involved, ordering American naval ships to fire interceptors in support of Israel.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: despite all the missile action, the market impact was limited... for now. Iran warned of further retaliation if Israel pushes back, and that looming threat could be enough to keep investors on edge.

The Aftershock  
Iran's show of force might have been aimed at Israel, but it sent ripples through global financial markets. Oil surges, stock dips, and safe-haven assets like bonds and gold saw some love. Investors, already skittish from broader geopolitical risks, aren't exactly thrilled about the idea of an expanded Middle Eastern conflict.

If the tension continues to escalate, expect volatility to hang around like that last guest who just won't leave the party.

# Dockworkers Launch Strike at Ports From Maine to Texas

Dockworkers from Maine to Texas have shut down some of the country‚Äôs busiest ports in a move that could strangle trade just as the holiday season gears up. The strike, led by the International Longshoremen‚Äôs Association (ILA), is driven by demands for a massive wage increase and resistance to port automation. Thousands of workers walked off the job early Tuesday, halting the flow of goods at critical trade hubs.

This is no ordinary labor dispute‚Äîit's a power play. Now he has laid down the gauntlet to Joe Biden, threatening to ‚Äúcripple‚Äù the US economy with strike action. And with the holiday season just around the corner, they have the leverage to do it.

Retailers Brace for Impact  
Big retailers, including Walmart, Costco, and IKEA, say they‚Äôve prepared for the strike by stocking up early and rerouting shipments to West Coast ports. But even they admit that a prolonged strike will drive up costs and could lead to shortages of key products. Shipping costs are already on the rise, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before consumers feel the pinch.

For now, holiday shoppers can breathe easy. But the longer this drags on, the harder it will be to keep shelves stocked.

Industries Feeling the Heat  
The auto industry, which relies heavily on East Coast ports for vehicle imports, is especially vulnerable. European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen are expected to take the biggest hit. But not everyone is suffering‚Äîair freight companies like FedEx and UPS are positioned to cash in as businesses scramble for alternative shipping methods.

Some companies are prepared for the long haul, but even the best-prepared businesses won‚Äôt escape unscathed if the strike stretches beyond a week. JP Morgan analysts estimate the U.S. economy could lose up to $4.5 billion per day from the disruption.

Crippling the Economy?  
Harold Daggett isn‚Äôt playing around. He‚Äôs leading a movement that could bring the U.S. economy to its knees, just as it did during the last major dockworker strike in 1977. With billions at stake and mounting political pressure, it‚Äôs a waiting game to see how long businesses‚Äîand consumers‚Äîcan hold out.

This strike might be making history, but it‚Äôs also setting the stage for a holiday season none of us will forget.

# Nike‚Äôs Guidance? Just Do‚Ä¶ It Later

Nike is playing it cautious, hitting the snooze button on its full-year guidance and pushing off its investor day, originally set for November. Why? A new CEO, Elliott Hill, is about to step in, and the company‚Äôs latest earnings showed a 10% drop in sales, so there‚Äôs some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Nike beat earnings expectations by $0.18 per share, but revenue? Missed the mark. The company reported $11.59 billion, slightly under the $11.65 billion analysts were hoping for. Investors weren't thrilled‚Äîshares slipped 5.32% in after-hours trading.

New Boss, New Playbook?  
With Hill taking the reins soon, Nike‚Äôs buying some time. Postponing the investor day gives him space to craft a fresh strategy‚Äîmuch needed, considering Nike expects revenue to slide another 8-10% next quarter. Ouch.

Investors are holding their breath, and they‚Äôre not exactly feeling the love. Nike‚Äôs stock is down 18% this year, far behind the S&P 500‚Äôs 20% gain. Hill‚Äôs going to need more than a pep talk to turn this ship around.

A Few Silver Linings  
Not everything is gloomy in swoosh land. Nike‚Äôs gross margin came in higher than expected, hitting 45.4%, thanks to smart price adjustments and lower logistics costs. Plus, sales in Greater China outperformed, with that region showing some resilience.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough to make up for weakness in North America and Europe, where sales tumbled. Even Converse couldn‚Äôt lace up a win‚Äîcontinuing to weigh on overall performance.

Gross margin up, but sales still slipping.

What‚Äôs Next for Nike?  
As Hill steps in, he‚Äôll need to put the innovation pedal to the metal. Nike‚Äôs been leaning too hard on legacy lines like Air Jordans, Dunks, and Air Force 1s‚Äîshoes that used to sell out in seconds but now struggle to hold the same hype. Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike‚Äôs product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, it's time for another pulse check on the labor market with the ADP National Employment Report, giving us a look at private sector job growth across the U.S.

The recent numbers haven‚Äôt exactly been brag-worthy. August saw just 99,000 new jobs, marking the fifth straight month of slowing growth. Yes, jobs are still being added, but the slowdown has economists sweating. For September, the magic number is 128,000. Anything less, and you can bet the Fed will be paying extra attention.

* Tilray Brands¬†($TLRY) has struggled this year as marijuana legalization slows down across the US and new avenues of growth fail to materialize. In the past, the marijuana grower has utilized its cash reserves to acquire competitors in order to foster growth‚Äîbut that strategy is running out of steam, just like the company is running out of money. A recent pivot into craft beer seems more desperate than inspired, and won‚Äôt do much to bolster this struggling stock‚Äôs bottom line anytime soon.

"What time frame do you trade?Hello I'm about 7 months in to my day trading journey and wanted to share something I found interesting while back testing my strategy. Changing your time frame changes a lot like where is a good place to enter and when you should exit.

Here is tesla today on a 1 minute time frame i was sent 4 buy signals 2 hit stop loss at .40 and 1 hit break even 1 hit take profit at 1%  all together would have only been up about .20%

"Am I missing something?Hi guys! First time posting here, and I wanted to share my experience from my first day of trading.

In a few months, I‚Äôll be a father‚Äîspecifically a single father‚Äîand I really need money so I can spend as much time as possible with my son/daughter and give them the best life I can. A few months ago, I started with crypto, but for me, it was too slow. So last week, I came across Trade Republic and its turbo warrants.

The feeling I got from turbo warrants was that they seemed too good to be true. They are highly leveraged derivatives, but to me, they looked like easy money, and I thought the risks could be minimized by just paying attention to the numbers. Still, I felt like something was missing. Nobody gives away money that easily.

Today, I transferred ‚Ç¨1,000 to my account and started trading for just a few minutes. I made ‚Ç¨300 in less than an hour (just by buying and selling NVDA, Gold, Tesla, Visa... turbo warrants). Since it was my first time, I tried to be a bit greedy to see how risky I could get. I ended up losing some money, but the whole experience netted me ‚Ç¨190 in profits.

I know it‚Äôs not a lot compared to some people here who make thousands, but today I earned as much as I would in a day of work (I make ‚Ç¨2,100 a month). Maybe I won‚Äôt make that much money every day, but it really feels like if I‚Äôm not too greedy, I could maintain this level of profit daily.

So, the question is: am I missing something? Or is it really that easy to earn extra money?

**TL;DR:** I made ‚Ç¨190 in a day, and I‚Äôm suspicious it could be like this every day.",10-01-2024

"How I Use Bookmap to EASILY Identify Entries and ExitsI've been day trading for 7 years and have been a consistently losing trader. Prior to a month ago, I purely used technical analysis and chart patterns to identify setups, and I would hold and hope for 3R winners. Inevitably, 70% of the time, the candlesticks would rollover and I'd lose.

The problem with candlesticks and indicators is that they only tell you what might happen based on previous data. The only way (in my opinion) to truly have an edge as a day trader is by understanding how to read real-time order flow.

I'm using Bookmap now and I'm consistently green. Bookmap is a data visualization tool for order flow. It provides the same data that's on Level 2, but in a visual format.

If you're an idiot like me, Level 2 moves too fast, so it's difficult to see where big blocks of passive orders are. Those passive orders act as Support and Resistance.

**Real World Example From Today:**

My strategy is to scan for highly liquid stocks that are trending at the Open and then add stocks with clear levels of large passive limit orders to my watchlist. 

Then, I wait to see what the stock does at those levels (Support or Resistance). If it breaks, I buy. If it fails, I sell. In the example below from today, you'll notice the HUGE wall of orders at $18. Once it rejected and closed in the red, I shorted it at $17.82, with my Stop loss at $18. I covered my short for profit at the Pre-Market High (Purple line.) There wasn't a wall of Buyers anywhere near by that could act as a clear level of Support, where price might bounce higher, so I got out at the pre-market high to play it safe. Once that level hit, momentum crept up and price went higher for the rest of the day. I had already made my money before the reversal, so I was good to go!

I think it's important to note, that Bookmap doesn't seem to work well for small cap momentum stocks, simply because there typically aren't large passive orders sitting on the DOM. I hate small caps anyway, so this doesn't bother me. Small caps is a game of musical chairs. It's high stakes gambling. Not for me.

Mega caps like Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, etc. are good ones. 

**How are you using Bookmap?**

I'd love to know if anyone else has any simple strategies for Bookmap that they'd like to share. I use the version that's built into Thinkorswim, so the capabilities are limited.

# Cards Against Humanity to Elon Musk: ""Go F*** Yourself!""

*This party game company sued SpaceX for a $15M property trespass‚Äîand throws in some spicy words for good measure.*

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) just served Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX a $15 million lawsuit, claiming the aerospace giant has been treating their Texas land like its own personal junkyard. The card game company, famous for making you feel¬†*just a little*¬†uncomfortable at game night, bought the land back in 2017 as part of a stunt to block Trump‚Äôs border wall plans.

Now, CAH says SpaceX has rolled in uninvited, parking cars, stacking debris, and generally trashing the place. When confronted, SpaceX reportedly offered a ‚Äúlowball‚Äù deal to buy the land‚Äîat less than half its value. CAH‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúGo f\*\*\* yourself, Elon.‚Äù

**""Wait‚ÄîCards Against**¬†***Who*****?"":**¬†In case you missed the 2017 newsflash, CAH raised around $2.25 million from supporters to buy land in Cameron County, Texas, with the express goal of making life harder for Trump‚Äôs border wall construction. The plot was left in its ‚Äúnatural state,‚Äù with wild horses (allegedly) roaming free. But recently, SpaceX‚Äôs construction activities‚Äîlike compacting soil and setting up generators‚Äîhave, according to CAH, turned the land into a space-age parking lot.

**The Stakes? Wild Vegetation‚Äîand Customer Trust:**¬†CAH‚Äôs complaint goes beyond crushed plants. They argue that SpaceX‚Äôs invasion has damaged their precious brand-customer relationship. And let‚Äôs be honest‚Äînothing says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to fight for your rights‚Äù like defending a piece of borderland against the world‚Äôs richest man. They‚Äôre worried that fans might start thinking they‚Äôre somehow in cahoots with SpaceX, which is a big no-no for a company that thrives on anti-establishment vibes.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has been beefing with other locals too. Residents in the nearby village of Boca Chica say SpaceX has taken over their town‚Äîcomplete with statue removals and sign teardowns. Because, of course, space domination starts at home.

If CAH wins the lawsuit, each donor will see a nice little payday‚Äîabout $100‚Äîon their $15 contribution. That‚Äôs a 700% return, folks. Maybe the real winning card is legal action after all.

# Meta Connect 2024: AR Glasses, Cheaper VR, and a Heavy Dose of AI

Mark your calendars, tech fans. Meta‚Äôs annual Connect developer conference kicks off on September 25th, and it's shaping up to be a buffet of VR, AR, and AI goodies.

The keynote kicks off at 1 PM ET / 10 AM PT on September 25th. You can stream it via the Meta Connect website, Facebook, or catch it live in VR on Horizon Worlds.

# Tomorrow

Get ready for a busy week of economic updates, kicking off with the S&P Case-Shiller home price index. Last month‚Äôs report showed a 5.4% jump in home prices for June, setting a new all-time high for the fourth straight month. Spoiler alert: July probably won‚Äôt break the trend, but everyone‚Äôs hoping future rate cuts will bring mortgage rates‚Äîand home prices‚Äîdown eventually.

Next up, we‚Äôll get a read on US consumer confidence. While the mood improved between July and August, concerns about the job market crept up, and stock market jitters didn‚Äôt help either (thanks, August volatility). But after a surprisingly strong September, maybe shoppers are feeling a bit more optimistic.

# Nike Shakes It Up ‚Äî CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who‚Äôs stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe‚Äôs last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :**¬†Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy‚Äôs in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike‚Äôs ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:**¬†With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He‚Äôs expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development‚Äîareas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill‚Äôs return is also a shot of morale for the company‚Äôs workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike‚Äôs upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe‚Äôs Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It‚Äôs not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that‚Äôs exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share‚Äîbut the board wasn‚Äôt feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she‚Äôs now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company‚Äôs stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you‚Äôve taken a DNA test, there‚Äôs not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What‚Äôs Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it‚Äôs a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company‚Äôs been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned‚Äî23andMe‚Äôs future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx‚Äôs Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a ‚Äúchallenging quarter‚Äù as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx‚Äôs premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren‚Äôt thrilled, and FedEx wasn‚Äôt the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market‚Äôs growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:**¬†FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share‚Äîdown from $22. And if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street‚Äôs $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company‚Äôs merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven‚Äôt quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:**¬†Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn‚Äôt helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

# Google Back in the Hot Seat ‚Äî The Antitrust Saga Continues

The Justice Department is back for round two with Google, and this time it‚Äôs all about ad-tech. Weeks after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search, another trial kicks off, this time in Virginia, targeting Google‚Äôs stronghold on digital advertising technology. The lawsuit claims Google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital ads‚Äîtools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat.

# The Case: Google‚Äôs Ad-Tech Monopoly?

The trial, expected to last several weeks, aims to determine whether Google‚Äôs control of both the buy-side and sell-side of the ad-tech ecosystem is crushing competition. The Justice Department, backed by 17 states, argues that Google‚Äôs practices have locked out rivals, with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools. They‚Äôre demanding Google shed its Ad Manager, which generated $368 million in profits from $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 alone.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Google has been hit with monopoly claims. A federal judge recently ruled that Google illegally maintained dominance in search, but this case could potentially cut deeper. If Google loses, it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business, which is crucial to Alphabet‚Äôs overall revenue‚Äî78% of its $307 billion annual earnings come from advertising.

# Google‚Äôs Defense: The Market Has Changed

In response, Google claims the Justice Department is stuck in the past, focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps, social media, and streaming platforms like TikTok and Peacock. Google‚Äôs legal team insists that the ad-tech space is more competitive than ever, with alternatives like Microsoft and Amazon gaining ground.

But the trial has already hit some bumps for Google. The company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case, something the judge criticized as ""not the way a responsible corporate entity should function."" This issue could factor into how the court weighs the credibility of witnesses.

# What‚Äôs Next for Google?

The trial, held without a jury, could significantly alter Google‚Äôs ad-tech empire. A government win would likely mean divesting parts of Google‚Äôs ad business, untangling years of acquisitions. With Google‚Äôs advertising technology so deeply embedded in the digital landscape, this case could reshape the industry for advertisers and publishers alike. And with antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe breathing down its neck, Google‚Äôs struggles are far from over.

This is just the beginning of a legal battle that could send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# CPI Tomorrow ‚Äî Inflation Data Holds the Key

This week, the Federal Reserve is set to get its final look at inflation numbers before its next policy meeting on September 18. With interest rate cuts all but certain, the key question now is: how big will the cut be? The answer hinges on two upcoming inflation reports‚Äîthe Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). These reports are expected to clarify the Fed‚Äôs next move, especially after Friday‚Äôs jobs report provided little guidance.

# CPI & PPI: The Deciding Factors

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August‚Äôs CPI report, followed by the PPI on Thursday. Economists are predicting a 0.2% monthly increase for both headline and core CPI, bringing annual inflation rates to 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The PPI is expected to mirror these figures. While the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, this week‚Äôs CPI and PPI readings will still play a crucial role in determining the size of the upcoming rate cut.

The debate is now centered on whether the Fed will opt for a modest 25-basis-point cut or go bigger with a 50-basis-point reduction. Futures markets currently favor a quarter-point cut, with odds hovering around 71%. However, a stronger-than-expected inflation reading could push the Fed toward a more aggressive move. Economists like Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, believe inflation data should be favorable for at least a small cut.

# Shifting Focus: From Inflation to Jobs

While inflation has been the Fed's main concern for months, the focus is now turning toward the labor market. Hiring has slowed significantly, with nonfarm payroll gains averaging just 135,000 per month since April, down from 255,000 in the prior five months. Job openings have also declined, raising fears that the labor market is weakening. This shift has increased expectations that the Fed will begin cutting rates sooner rather than later, starting with a baby step at the next meeting.

# What‚Äôs Next?

After this week‚Äôs inflation reports, all eyes will be on the Fed‚Äôs September 18 meeting. If the data shows more progress in curbing inflation, the central bank may lean toward a larger rate cut. But even if the Fed starts small, markets expect more cuts to follow, with a possible half-point reduction in November and another in December. As the Fed navigates these murky waters, the balance between taming inflation and supporting a cooling labor market will guide its next moves.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Inflation‚Äôs about to take center stage again. Tomorrow, we get the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) report‚Äîaka, the data that shows how much more (or less) expensive life has gotten over the past year. While the Fed has plenty of tools to gauge inflation, CPI is the star of the show‚Äîespecially core CPI, which leaves out the drama of volatile food and energy prices.

Economists are penciling in a 0.2% rise for August, same as July‚Äôs bump. If that holds, it would push annual inflation down from 2.9% to 2.6%. Core inflation is also expected to clock in at 3.2% year-over-year. If these numbers land as predicted, the Fed will probably have the green light to trim rates by 25 basis points at next week‚Äôs meeting.

# August Jobs Report: Not Great, Not Terrible

It looks like the Fed has some tough choices to make after August‚Äôs jobs report hit with a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù response. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs‚Äîbetter than July‚Äôs nerve-wracking numbers but not the blowout people were hoping for. The unemployment rate also dipped a little to 4.2%, which might calm some nerves but doesn‚Äôt answer the big question: Will the Fed cut rates by a quarter-point or go bold with a half-point?

# What Happened?

The Fed‚Äôs been itching to cut rates, especially after June and July‚Äôs job growth took a nosedive. But Friday‚Äôs report was like a Goldilocks situation‚Äînot too hot, not too cold. The headline numbers weren‚Äôt weak enough to scream ‚Äúemergency,‚Äù but downward revisions to the summer months suggest things aren‚Äôt looking as strong as they seemed.

Here‚Äôs what we know:

* **Job growth**: 142,000 in August, following revised numbers from June and July, which showed 86,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
* **Unemployment**: A modest dip to 4.2%.
* **Wage growth**: Hourly earnings ticked up 3.8% year-over-year, a small silver lining for workers.

# Fed's Dilemma: 25 or 50?

With the Fed‚Äôs next meeting on Sept. 18, central bankers are torn between two options:

* **The safe bet**: Cut rates by 25 basis points to keep things steady and avoid rocking the boat.
* **The bold move**: Go for a 50 basis point cut to really send a message and juice the economy. Some argue that the summer hiring slowdown justifies this.

So, what‚Äôs the vibe on Wall Street? Uncertainty. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7% on Friday, marking its worst week in 18 months. The bond market also reacted with 10-year Treasury yields dipping to their lowest point in over a year.

# Fed Speak

Fed Governor Christopher Waller hinted that a sequence of cuts is likely but didn‚Äôt give a clear signal on whether they‚Äôll go for the big 50 basis point cut just yet. Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams remained non-committal, saying he didn‚Äôt have a firm view on the size of the cut.

In short, the Fed‚Äôs in a wait-and-see mode, leaving markets jittery heading into September.

# What‚Äôs Next?

While August‚Äôs job report wasn‚Äôt a disaster, it didn‚Äôt exactly boost confidence, either. Economists are now looking ahead to see if the Fed will play it safe with a smaller cut or go for a bigger move to jumpstart the economy. Whatever happens, it‚Äôs going to keep markets on their toes.

# Selena Gomez Joins the Billionaire Club

Selena Gomez has officially entered the billionaire club, and it's not from breaking records on the Billboard charts. Her beauty brand, Rare Beauty, has turned the 32-year-old actress, singer, and entrepreneur into one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the U.S., with a fortune of $1.3 billion, according to Bloomberg. But don‚Äôt be fooled‚Äîthis success story goes way beyond a pop star simply slapping her name on some lip gloss.

# The Rare Billionaire Formula

The vast bulk of Selena's wealth‚Äîaround $1.1 billion‚Äîcomes from her 51% stake in Rare Beauty, the makeup line she launched in 2020. It‚Äôs a brand that hit big with influencers and Gen Z, generating $350 million in revenue last year. Rare Beauty isn't just another celeb-founded brand; it‚Äôs become a beauty powerhouse, outshining competitors like Jessica Alba‚Äôs Honest Co. and Lady Gaga‚Äôs Haus Labs. What makes it stand out? For starters, Selena marketed it as affordable, high-quality, and inclusive, with a message that celebrates authenticity. No wonder it‚Äôs selling out faster than her concert tickets.

But it‚Äôs not all about making bank. Rare Beauty donates 1% of its sales to the Rare Impact Fund, which aims to raise $100 million over the next decade to support mental health services. The fund is deeply personal to Gomez, who has been candid about her own struggles with bipolar disorder. This combination of purpose-driven business and beauty innovation has not only cemented Rare Beauty‚Äôs place in the market but also earned Gomez a loyal customer base.

# Diversifying Her Empire

While Rare Beauty is the crown jewel of her portfolio, Selena is far from a one-trick pony. She‚Äôs got her hands in several pots, and it‚Äôs paying off big time. Her mental health startup, Wondermind, which she co-founded with her mom and Daniella Pierson of¬†*The Newsette*, was valued at $100 million in 2022. It‚Äôs backed by investors like Sequoia Capital and Serena Williams‚Äôs venture fund. Wondermind is all about providing accessible mental health tools and resources, and it fits neatly into Selena‚Äôs broader mission of mental health advocacy.

Then there‚Äôs her acting career, which is booming. Selena stars alongside comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short in¬†*Only Murders in the Building*, raking in at least $6 million per season. The Hulu hit just kicked off its fourth season, and Selena‚Äôs performance as the quirky, mysterious Mabel Mora has earned her an Emmy nomination. While she may have started her career as a Disney darling, Selena‚Äôs acting chops and producing gigs (she‚Äôs also an executive producer on the show) are proving she‚Äôs got serious staying power in Hollywood.

# Brand Partnerships and Social Media Power

When Selena‚Äôs not in front of the camera or overseeing Rare Beauty, she‚Äôs leveraging her massive social media following‚Äî424 million Instagram followers, making her the third most followed person on the platform, trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. That digital clout has scored her major brand deals. She inked a $30 million deal with Puma and a $10 million contract with Coach. These partnerships, combined with her music royalties and acting roles, have only added to her ever-growing fortune.

What‚Äôs fascinating is that while Selena‚Äôs music career helped launch her into the public eye, it‚Äôs not a major source of her wealth. Unlike her friend Taylor Swift, who owns much of her songwriting catalog, Selena‚Äôs music earnings come primarily from performance royalties. Her last tour was back in 2016, and while it raked in $30 million, music accounts for less than 5% of her total net worth. Smart move? Absolutely. Selena has built a diversified empire that isn‚Äôt tied to the volatile ups and downs of the music industry.

# Building a Legacy

So, what‚Äôs next for Selena? For now, she‚Äôs keeping her focus on acting and business, hinting that while she might have one more album in her, her passion lies elsewhere. ‚ÄúI would probably choose acting,‚Äù she revealed on a recent episode of the¬†*SmartLess*¬†podcast. She‚Äôs also expanding her empire into new projects, including executive producing a reboot of her Disney Channel hit¬†*Wizards of Waverly Place*.

And let‚Äôs not forget the potential growth of Rare Beauty. While Selena has fielded offers to sell the brand, including a reported $2 billion valuation, she‚Äôs publicly said she has no plans to let go of her beauty baby anytime soon. Given Rare‚Äôs rapid rise and staying power, she might be right to hold on and ride the wave.

Selena‚Äôs success isn‚Äôt just a stroke of good luck‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully crafted blend of talent, business savvy, and authenticity. She‚Äôs created multiple revenue streams, invested in long-term ventures, and built a brand that resonates deeply with her fans. At just 32, she‚Äôs already established herself as a mogul in the beauty industry and beyond.

# The Rare Takeaway

Selena Gomez‚Äôs ascent to billionaire status is proof that being a multi-hyphenate pays off‚Äîliterally. While her journey started as a child star on¬†*Barney & Friends*¬†and Disney‚Äôs¬†*Wizards of Waverly Place*, she‚Äôs grown into a force to be reckoned with, using her platform to not only build a fortune but to also promote causes she cares deeply about. Rare Beauty is much more than a makeup brand; it‚Äôs a testament to her vision, resilience, and commitment to being authentic, both on and off the screen.

Her next chapter? Whatever it is, it‚Äôs sure to be¬†*rare*¬†and profitable.

# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week‚Äôs lineup is looking pretty light, but there‚Äôs one report that‚Äôs got everyone buzzing.

On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) drops, and it‚Äôs a big one. CPI is the go-to inflation gauge, and whatever it shows could nudge the Federal Reserve toward its next move. Last month, inflation rose 2.9% over the past year‚Äîthe smallest jump since March 2021. If the cooling trend continues, it‚Äôll give the Fed even more reason to consider cutting rates later this month.

And while earnings season is wrapping up, there are still a few stragglers worth watching. Keep your eyes peeled.

# Verizon To Acquire Frontier

Verizon is making some serious moves in the broadband game, dropping $9.6 billion to acquire Frontier Communications. Toss in Frontier‚Äôs debt, and the total deal hits $20 billion, giving Verizon access to Frontier‚Äôs 2.2 million fiber subscribers across 25 states. Why does this matter? Verizon is locking down its spot in the fiber race, going head-to-head with AT&T and cable companies that are nibbling away at its market share.

# A Strategic Fiber Expansion

Frontier‚Äôs investors are walking away with a nice 37% premium at $38.50 per share. For Verizon, it‚Äôs a big pivot as it looks to bulk up its fiber footprint in key markets. By scooping up Frontier‚Äôs assets, Verizon merges those with its 7.4 million Fios subscribers in nine states and Washington, D.C. Fun fact: some of these assets were actually Verizon‚Äôs before they sold them to Frontier in 2016 for $10.54 billion. CEO Hans Vestberg said this is all about ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù as data demand keeps exploding, thanks to AI and other data-hungry technologies.

# The Fiber Race Heats Up

Everyone wants in on the fiber game these days. AT&T is going all out with its own fiber network expansion, while T-Mobile just threw down $4.9 billion on a joint venture to boost its fiber capabilities. Verizon‚Äôs acquisition of Frontier, though, gives it a big leg up in the race to deliver faster and more reliable internet to customers. With wireless growth slowing, telecoms are betting that home internet is the next cash cow.

But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing. Frontier‚Äôs stock dipped 9.3% after the news, as investors brace for what could be a lengthy regulatory review. There‚Äôs also doubt about whether any other bidders will emerge. The deal is expected to take around 18 months to close, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Verizon, already carrying over $120 billion in debt, is banking on $500 million in annual cost savings by year three to make this deal worth it.

# What‚Äôs Next for Verizon?

This acquisition signals Verizon‚Äôs commitment to going fiber-first. With Frontier‚Äôs assets in key areas like California, Texas, and Florida, Verizon will now serve a total of 10 million fiber-optic customers. It‚Äôs still playing catch-up to AT&T‚Äôs 28 million, but this is a step in the right direction. Even though Verizon‚Äôs fiber network will cover less than 10% of the U.S., the company sees this deal as a building block for bigger broadband dominance.

In a nutshell, Verizon is doubling down on fiber to keep up with our increasingly data-hungry world. It‚Äôs a high-stakes play, but if the company can execute, this move could give it a major leg up as the demand for faster, more reliable internet continues to surge. And don‚Äôt be surprised if the fiber race gets even more competitive from here.

# All Eyes on Friday's Jobs Report

Friday‚Äôs jobs report could be the mic drop moment for the U.S. economy, with Wall Street bracing for impact. Economists are expecting a moderate gain of 161,000 jobs in August, a slight improvement from July‚Äôs underwhelming 114,000, and a dip in unemployment to 4.2%. But don‚Äôt be fooled by the numbers; a recent wave of grim data suggests the labor market might be cooling faster than a pumpkin spice latte in December.

# The Fed Factor

The Fed is teetering on the edge of a rate cut, with markets betting that a quarter-point reduction is a done deal, and a half-point cut could be on the table if Friday's report looks dicey. With rates currently at their highest in 23 years, the central bank may need to act fast to avoid the ‚ÄúR‚Äù word‚Äîrecession. (We hate to say it, too.)

Giacomo Santangelo, economist at Monster, sums it up: ""The labor market is cooling, but the Fed‚Äôs next move depends on how chilly things get on Friday.""

# Jobs Data Drama

July was a wake-up call, with payroll growth dragging and the private sector adding just 99,000 jobs in August‚Äîits weakest performance since 2021, according to ADP. Companies are cutting back on hiring faster than a Hollywood script rewrite, but layoffs haven‚Äôt surged‚Ä¶ yet.

The big question: How long can businesses play defense with hiring freezes before they hit the layoff button? Tech firms are already feeling the squeeze, accounting for over half of August‚Äôs 75,891 job cuts, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. AI isn‚Äôt helping either‚Äîit‚Äôs cutting into nearly 6,000 of those tech jobs.

# What to Watch

Alongside job gains and unemployment, economists will be eyeing several indicators in Friday‚Äôs report:

* **Hours worked**: Average workweek hours fell slightly in July, and a further dip could signal reduced demand.
* **Labor force participation**: More people jumping back into the job market could mean optimism‚Äîor a higher unemployment rate.
* **Temporary layoffs**: July saw a jump in temp layoffs, largely due to auto industry retooling. If those turn permanent, buckle up.



# 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs the moment of truth: the US jobs report is dropping, giving us a pulse check on the labor market. This data-packed report pulls info from all over and delivers the clearest view of employment in the country.

Last month, it didn‚Äôt go so well. July‚Äôs report showed only 114,000 jobs added, far below expectations, which sent the stock market into a nosedive. The concern? That the Fed might not have enough ammo to fend off a downturn.

For August, the forecast is looking a bit brighter‚Äîeconomists expect 161,000 new jobs and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. If the numbers fall short again, brace for another market slide. The silver lining? Bad news could nudge the Fed to go bigger with rate cuts next month.

# Chase A Check‚Ä¶ Or Maybe 3 Years In Prison

Hold onto your debit cards, folks! Chase Bank has come forward to debunk a viral trend that‚Äôs been circulating on TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). The so-called ""glitch"" that supposedly lets users deposit fake checks and withdraw real money? Yeah, not a glitch. It‚Äôs fraud.

Over the weekend, videos flooded social media with users claiming they could deposit phony checks at Chase ATMs and withdraw the funds before the bank caught on. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs a crime. Chase quickly addressed the situation, reminding customers that this is fraud, ""plain and simple."" The bank's message was clear‚Äîno matter what TikTok tells you, check fraud is still very much illegal.

# Check Out the Reality Check

Despite what the hype might suggest, this isn't some revolutionary new money hack. The tactic of depositing fake checks and withdrawing cash before they bounce is as old as checks themselves. Fraudsters usually pull this off by opening accounts under fake names, but this time around, people tried it with their own accounts‚Äîmaking it super easy for Chase to identify and slam the door shut.

In a statement, a Chase spokesperson said, ""We are aware of this incident, and it has been addressed."" Translation: We caught on fast, and we're not amused.

# TikTok‚Äôers Learn the Hard Way

The internet had a field day with this one. What started as videos of users showing off stacks of cash quickly turned into clips of them facing massive negative balances and holds on their accounts. One user summed it up perfectly: ‚ÄúChase Bank glitch? No, that‚Äôs called fraud. You went to the bank and took $50,000 that didn‚Äôt belong to you. That‚Äôs not a life hack; that‚Äôs called robbery.‚Äù

So, here‚Äôs the takeaway: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to real jobs or legit side hustles, and leave the check fraud to the scammers. They‚Äôre not going to win any awards, but at least they know what they‚Äôre signing up for.

* **Same-Store Sales Growth:**¬†+0.7% overall; +1.3% at Dollar Tree stores; -0.1% at Family Dollar stores

Not everything is priced at a dollar, including Dollar Tree‚Äôs ($DLTR) stock, which plunged over 22% on Wednesday after the company slashed its full-year outlook. The discount retailer blamed rising pressures on middle- and higher-income customers who are feeling the pinch and spending less on non-essentials.

# What Went Wrong?

Dollar Tree had to face some harsh realities this quarter. The company now expects its full-year net sales to come in between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion, a drop from the previously anticipated $31 billion to $32 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were also revised down to a range of $5.20 to $5.60, from a higher $6.50 to $7. Not exactly the kind of news investors were hoping for.

So, what‚Äôs causing all this trouble? According to CFO Jeff Davis, the company is dealing with softer sales, especially on the discretionary side‚Äîbasically, anything that isn't an absolute necessity. They‚Äôve also had to pay more in costs related to customer accidents at their stores and expenses from converting 99 Cents Only stores. Not the most fun way to spend your cash.

# Dollar Stores Aren‚Äôt Feeling So Discounted

Dollar Tree isn‚Äôt the only one feeling the burn. Last week, Dollar General also cut its full-year forecast, noting that its core customers are feeling financially squeezed. Meanwhile, big names like Walmart and even online newcomers like Temu are capturing the attention of budget-conscious shoppers.

For Dollar Tree, same-store sales in the latest quarter inched up by just 0.7%, with the Dollar Tree stores themselves seeing a 1.3% rise and Family Dollar stores dipping slightly by 0.1%. The modest gains are a clear sign that customers are tightening their belts and making fewer trips for non-essentials.

# Facing Headwinds and Hard Choices

Beyond consumer belt-tightening, Dollar Tree is grappling with some company-specific challenges. It‚Äôs shutting down about 1,000 underperforming Family Dollar stores and might even sell off the Family Dollar brand. This move comes after struggling to integrate the grocery-focused chain, which it bought for nearly $9 billion in 2015.

On top of that, the company‚Äôs dealing with a slew of liability claims from customer accidents, which are proving to be more costly and unpredictable than expected. These added expenses aren‚Äôt doing any favors for their bottom line.

Dollar Tree is hoping that the back-to-school season and upcoming holidays might give them a boost, but with consumers being extra cautious with their spending, it might take more than just a sale on party supplies to turn things around. Until then, it‚Äôs clear that not even Dollar Tree can escape the effects of a tough economic climate.

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow's lineup has the labor market taking center stage with two big headliners: the ADP Employment Report and initial jobless claims, both dropping bright and early.

First up, the ADP Employment Report‚Äîour monthly pulse check on private sector hiring. Last time around, the report showed 122,000 new jobs, paired with a 4.8% bump in annual pay. Decent stats, but they didn‚Äôt exactly get economists popping champagne. For July, the forecast is a bit more festive, with predictions of 140,000 new jobs.

On the flip side, initial jobless claims will tell us how many folks filed for unemployment benefits last week. The latest count was 231,000, a slight dip of 2,000 from the week before. The experts are crossing their fingers for a further drop to 225,000 in tomorrow's report.

* **Broadcom**¬†($AVGO) has lagged behind its AI-driven peers this year, despite delivering robust earnings.

# Buffett's Berkshire Joins the Trillion-Dollar Club¬†

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just hit a whopping $1 trillion market cap, becoming the first non-tech U.S. company to join the exclusive trillion-dollar club. Take that, Silicon Valley!

Berkshire's stock has been on a roll this year, climbing 30% in 2024 and outpacing the S&P 500's 17% gain. The company's strong performance has been fueled by robust insurance results, economic optimism, and the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts on the horizon.

# Old-School Cool with a Modern Twist¬†

Unlike its techy trillion-dollar club companions‚Äîthink Apple ($AAPL), Microsoft, and Nvidia‚ÄîBerkshire's success is built on what some might call ""old-school"" businesses. We're talking railways, insurance, and Dairy Queen blizzards, not cloud computing or AI chips.

Buffett, who took over a floundering textile company in the 1960s and transformed it into this sprawling conglomerate, has proven that slow and steady does indeed win the race. Even with a significant chunk of Berkshire's portfolio invested in Apple, the firm's focus on value over flashy growth has paid off big time.

# Cash Moves and Strategic Shifts¬†

Recently, Buffett has been in what some might call ""defensive mode."" He's been trimming Berkshire's holdings in some heavyweights like Apple and Bank of America, building up a record cash pile of about $277 billion. This cautious approach has some investors speculating whether the Oracle of Omaha is seeing storm clouds on the economic horizon.

Buffett might be getting ready for more acquisition opportunities or simply reinforcing Berkshire's reputation as a safe haven amidst market uncertainty. Whatever the case, his strategy appears to be working‚Äîinvestors are rewarding Berkshire's steady hand with a spot in the trillion-dollar club.

# What‚Äôs Next?¬†

Looking ahead, Berkshire's all-weather portfolio seems well-positioned for whatever the future holds. The company might not boast eye-popping growth, but it's hard to argue with a steady performer in a world of market volatility.

As Greg Abel prepares to step into Buffett's legendary shoes, only time will tell if Berkshire can continue its winning streak. But for now, the Oracle of Omaha's empire is basking in the glow of a trillion-dollar valuation‚Äîa testament to the power of patience, prudence, and, of course, a good old-fashioned blizzard from Dairy Queen.

# Nvidia: Not Quite Perfect

# By the Numbers:

* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**¬†$0.68 adjusted vs. $0.64 expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$30 billion vs. $28.9 billion expected
* **Q3 Revenue Forecast:**¬†$32.5 billion vs. $31.9 billion expected (but fell short of high estimates up to $37.9 billion)
* **Stock Movement:**¬†Down -5.87% in extended trading

Nvidia ($NVDA) just dropped their latest earnings report, and while it wasn't a total disaster, it also didn't have us popping champagne. The chipmaker forecasted third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, which is technically higher than the average analyst estimate of $31.9 billion. But here's the catch: some pie-in-the-sky expectations were up to $37.9 billion. As a result, Nvidia's stock took a 5% dip in late trading, adding a reality check to its gravity-defying run this year.

* **Chip Slip:**¬†The culprit behind this lukewarm reception? Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. The company admitted to hitting some production snags, which means they‚Äôre tinkering with manufacturing processes to boost yields (think: more functioning chips per batch). While CEO Jensen Huang reassured everyone that the ""anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,"" the market isn't big on anticipation‚Äîit‚Äôs all about execution.
* **Data Center Dominance:**¬†Nvidia has been riding the AI boom like a pro surfer catching a killer wave. With nearly 88% of its revenue coming from data center chips, Nvidia is the go-to for AI accelerators. Last quarter, they pulled in $26.3 billion from their data-center division alone, handily beating the $25.1 billion estimate. Their gaming segment isn‚Äôt too shabby either, with $2.9 billion in sales. But let‚Äôs face it, all eyes are on their AI chips powering the likes of ChatGPT.
* **Competition Heating Up:**¬†Nvidia‚Äôs success hasn't gone unnoticed. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are scrambling to grab a slice of the AI pie, even if their combined revenues only account for about 5% of Nvidia‚Äôs total. Meanwhile, Nvidia continues to expand its lead, having shipped samples of its Blackwell chips despite the production hiccups.
* **AI Boom or Bust? :**¬†With a market cap north of $3 trillion, Nvidia has been the belle of the AI ball. Yet, the soaring spending on AI infrastructure has some wondering if we're heading towards a bubble. Nvidia remains optimistic, projecting that the demand for its AI chips will continue to skyrocket. Investors, on the other hand, might be looking for more than just optimism after the stock‚Äôs recent rollercoaster ride.

For now, it looks like Nvidia is still in the driver's seat of the AI revolution. But with production challenges and rising competition, they'll need to keep their foot on the gas.

# Temu‚Äôs Parent Company PDD Takes a Dive

PDD Holdings ($PDD), the proud parent of budget shopping sensation Temu, just took a nasty tumble down the stock market stairs. After posting lackluster quarterly sales and giving a gloomy forecast, shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant plummeted 28.5% on Monday, marking the steepest single-day drop in the company's history. Ouch.

# Not-So-Sunny Outlook

What‚Äôs behind this dramatic fall from grace? It turns out, PDD‚Äôs latest revenue figures didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark. The company reported revenue of $13.36 billion for Q2, falling short of Wall Street's forecast of $14.03 billion. That's a miss that investors didn't take lightly. Jun Liu, PDD‚Äôs VP of finance, didn‚Äôt sugarcoat the situation, warning of ‚Äúintensified competition and external challenges‚Äù that could continue to put pressure on growth and profitability. In other words, it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road ahead.

Even with a massive marketing push and heavy investments in expansion, the slowdown is evident. The company noted that Chinese consumers are shifting their spending from goods to experiences‚Äîthink less shopping, more eating out and entertainment. This shift, coupled with an ailing Chinese economy, has left PDD scrambling to adjust its strategy. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, rivals like Alibaba ($BABA) and JD. com ($JD) are also feeling the heat, posting weaker-than-expected results in the face of changing consumer behaviors and economic conditions.

# All About That Budget Life

Despite the challenges at home, PDD has been casting a wider net, particularly in Europe and beyond, trying to capture the global audience‚Äôs attention with Temu's low-cost charm. And it‚Äôs not just the usual suspects like Alibaba that PDD has to worry about‚Äîeveryone from TikTok‚Äôs parent company ByteDance to Amazon is vying for the budget-conscious shopper‚Äôs dollar.

PDD‚Äôs plan? Double down on investment, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits. Chairman and Co-CEO Chen Lei made it clear that they‚Äôre willing to accept ‚Äúshort-term sacrifices‚Äù to build a stronger foundation for the future. In the meantime, PDD is focusing on cleaning up its platform by supporting high-quality merchants and cracking down on the lower-quality ones.

# What‚Äôs Next?

With competition heating up and consumer spending on the decline, PDD is gearing up for a fight to maintain its spot in the e-commerce world. While the company has made significant strides in gaining ground against giants like Alibaba and JD. com, it's clear that they‚Äôre in for a tough battle both at home and abroad. The days ahead will tell whether PDD‚Äôs aggressive growth strategy will pay off or if it‚Äôll face more turbulence in the marketplace.

# Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Detained in France

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov just found himself in hot water in France‚Äîand not the ice-cold baths he‚Äôs famously fond of. The 39-year-old billionaire was detained at an airport outside Paris, suspected of allowing illegal activity to run rampant on Telegram, the messaging app he founded. If you‚Äôre picturing Durov scrolling through a flurry of encrypted messages, sipping his French espresso, think again.

French authorities aren‚Äôt thrilled with Telegram‚Äôs hands-off approach to content moderation, and they‚Äôve made it known. Durov‚Äôs arrest, which could be extended by 24 hours, is part of a broader investigation into online criminality.¬†Allegations range from the distribution of child exploitation material to fraud and cyberbullying. Durov‚Äôs failure to cooperate with law enforcement on these matters didn‚Äôt help his case either.

# Russian Roulette

The plot thickens with some political spice‚ÄîDurov‚Äôs arrest has sparked a wave of reactions. The Russian Embassy in Paris quickly demanded explanations from French authorities, while Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to rally support for Durov with a ‚Äú#FreePavel‚Äù hashtag, suggesting this is an assault on free speech.

President Emmanuel Macron, however, insists there‚Äôs no political motivation here. He assured that Durov‚Äôs arrest was purely a legal matter, not a diplomatic chess move. Macron‚Äôs statement comes as French authorities crack down on platforms like Telegram, which they believe facilitate illegal activities due to lax content oversight.

# Telegram‚Äôs Wild Ride

Founded in 2013, Telegram quickly became a hit, especially in countries with strict censorship. It‚Äôs been a crucial communication tool for both Ukrainian officials and the Russian government during the ongoing war, making it a favorite for those who value privacy‚Äîand for some, a tool for illicit activity.

With over 900 million users, Telegram has also been a thorn in the side of governments worldwide, thanks to its encrypted messaging and limited moderation. Durov, who lives in Dubai and holds citizenship in France and the UAE, might be the latest high-profile tech CEO to face the consequences of this tension between free speech and regulation.

# What‚Äôs Next?

As Durov waits to see if his detention will be extended, the tech world is watching closely. Will he face charges, or is this just a scare tactic? For now, Telegram‚Äôs CEO remains in a legal limbo, caught between his app‚Äôs free-wheeling ethos and the tightening grip of government oversight.

# Tomorrow

Hey, shoppers! It‚Äôs time to check your economic vitals because tomorrow, the Conference Board is dropping its latest consumer confidence report. Think of it as a sneak peek into the collective mood of American wallets‚Äîare we feeling spendy or saving those pennies?

Here‚Äôs the scoop: Consumer spending powers about 70% of the US economy, so all eyes are on this report to see just how sturdy that spending spree is. Analysts are predicting a slight boost in confidence, with August‚Äôs index expected to climb to 101.8 from July‚Äôs 100.3. For context, any number over 90 usually signals a robust economy.¬†

Another thing to watch? Home-buying intentions. With mortgage rates cooling off a bit, will more people be house hunting? Last month, intentions hit a 12-year low, so any uptick could be a big deal.

# Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come‚Ä¶

Drumroll, please! Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just dropped the mic at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, announcing the Fed‚Äôs plans to cut interest rates. Yup, the big pivot is here. After two years of cranking up rates to tame inflation, Powell is officially ready to start loosening the purse strings.

# Breaking Down the Big Shift

In what has to be the least surprising surprise of the year, Powell confirmed that rate cuts are coming soon, saying, ‚ÄúThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.‚Äù Translation? The Fed is done playing the inflation-fighting game and is now turning its attention to preventing a meltdown in the job market.

And Wall Street heard him loud and clear. Stocks jumped, with the Dow climbing over 400 points and the Nasdaq up by about 1.5%. Investors are stoked, Treasury yields are dipping, and everyone‚Äôs feeling a little lighter‚Äîexcept maybe those holding cash.

# So, What‚Äôs the Game Plan?

With inflation cooling off and the job market starting to look like a sad trombone, Powell‚Äôs got his eye on rate cuts. The big question now is: How much and how fast? The next Fed meeting in mid-September is shaping up to be a real cliffhanger. Will they go for a cautious quarter-point cut, or do they swing for the fences with a half-point slash?

As always, it‚Äôs all about the data. Powell didn‚Äôt spill all the beans, but he made it clear the Fed will be watching the numbers closely. A few more weak jobs reports, and we could see some serious rate-cutting action.

# What Does It Mean for You?

Well, if you‚Äôve been sweating those sky-high interest rates on your mortgage, auto loan, or credit card, there might be some relief on the horizon. But don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet‚ÄîPowell‚Äôs not exactly rushing to the finish line here. Rate cuts will likely be gradual, and the Fed‚Äôs going to take it slow and steady to avoid rocking the boat too much.

So, keep an eye on those economic reports, stay tuned for the next Fed move, and maybe start planning what you‚Äôll do with those extra dollars in your pocket. A new plant for the office? That fancy coffee machine? The possibilities are endless, but the rate cuts? Not so much. Let‚Äôs see how this one plays out!

# Polaris Dawn Mission Faces Brief Delay Before Historic Spacewalk

The Polaris Dawn mission, which is set to make history as the first space mission featuring a spacewalk conducted entirely by non-government astronauts, has been delayed by 24 hours. Originally slated for launch early Monday, the mission is now scheduled for liftoff on Tuesday at the earliest, according to SpaceX. This minor setback is all part of ensuring everything is perfect before this groundbreaking flight.

# What's the Plan?

Once it gets the green light, SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket will carry the all-civilian Polaris Dawn crew aboard the Dragon spacecraft to an altitude of 870 miles above Earth. This marks the highest any human has flown since the Apollo missions of the 1970s. The team will then descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth, where they will spend five days conducting scientific experiments and testing new technologies, including a laser-based satellite communication system using SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink.

But the highlight of the mission will undoubtedly be the spacewalk, set to be the first-ever performed by private citizens. This ambitious feat will require the entire Dragon spacecraft to be depressurized, a risky maneuver given that the craft lacks an airlock. As a result, all four crew members, led by billionaire entrepreneur and mission commander Jared Isaacman, will don SpaceX‚Äôs new EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) suits and be tethered for safety as they venture into the vacuum of space.

# A Mission for the Books

This mission isn‚Äôt just about making history for the sake of it. The Polaris Dawn crew, which includes Isaacman, retired Air Force lieutenant colonel Scott ‚ÄúKidd‚Äù Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, aims to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight and gather valuable data for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The team will navigate through the Van Allen radiation belts‚Äîregions of intense radiation that pose significant challenges for deep space exploration‚Äîwhile testing the limits of their new spacesuits.

Despite the slight delay, anticipation remains high for what could be one of the most significant milestones in the burgeoning era of commercial space exploration. As Isaacman and his crew prepare to take civilian space travel to new heights, the world will be watching closely, eager to see this next chapter in human spaceflight unfold.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week‚Äôs economic calendar might kick off with some lightweights, but the real action comes on Friday. Monday brings us durable goods orders, Tuesday features the consumer confidence index, and Thursday rounds out the preliminaries with the advance goods trade balance.

Then, it's showtime: Friday‚Äôs Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report takes the stage. This is the last PCE reading before the Fed‚Äôs September meeting, where they‚Äôre expected to cut rates. How much they cut‚Äî25 or 50 basis points‚Äîcould hinge on what this report has to say.

Earnings are slowing down, but there‚Äôs still some excitement in store. Wednesday is the main event, headlined by none other than Nvidia ($NVDA).

# Powell at the Podium ‚Äî What to Expect from the Fed Chair‚Äôs Jackson Hole Speech

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is stepping up to the mic at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET. And while the setting might be picturesque, don‚Äôt get your hopes up for any earth-shattering news. Here‚Äôs what you can expect from Powell‚Äôs highly anticipated speech‚Äîand why it might be more of a snoozer than a showstopper.

# Rate Cuts Are Coming... Just Not Yet

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight: Wall Street‚Äôs already convinced that rate cuts are on the horizon. The smart money says the Fed‚Äôs going to start trimming rates in September and keep snipping away well into 2025. The real mystery is whether Powell will go for a cautious quarter-point cut or something bolder, like half a point. Most bets are on the former‚Äîunless the economy suddenly hits a rough patch in the next few weeks.

So, what‚Äôs Powell‚Äôs role in all this? He‚Äôs there to confirm the market‚Äôs expectations without spooking anyone. The theme of this year‚Äôs conference, ‚ÄúReassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,‚Äù is pretty much code for, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing it safe and sticking to the data.‚Äù Translation: Powell‚Äôs speech will likely be more of a recap than a revelation.

# Same Script, Different Year

This isn‚Äôt Powell‚Äôs first rodeo at Jackson Hole. Back in 2020, he used this same stage to roll out a new strategy that let inflation run hotter than usual, all in the name of promoting a more inclusive job market. Flash forward to now, and Powell‚Äôs likely to acknowledge the Fed‚Äôs progress in cooling down inflation while keeping an eye on a labor market that‚Äôs starting to show some cracks.

But if you‚Äôre expecting any major policy shifts, don‚Äôt hold your breath. Powell‚Äôs message will probably be something like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made progress, but we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet.‚Äù In other words, he‚Äôll hint that rate cuts are coming but won‚Äôt commit to specifics. After all, the Fed‚Äôs been preaching ‚Äúdata dependency‚Äù for months now, and that tune isn‚Äôt changing anytime soon.

So, while the backdrop at Jackson Hole will be as dramatic as ever, Powell‚Äôs speech? Not so much. Expect cautious optimism, a lot of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre watching the numbers,‚Äù and a gentle pat on the back for a job (mostly) well done. The markets might not get the fireworks they were hoping for, but hey, steady and predictable isn‚Äôt the worst thing in the world.

# Peloton‚Äôs Power Move: Biggest Rally Ever as Turnaround Takes Shape

Peloton ($PTON) just hit a major milestone‚Äîits biggest stock rally ever. After reporting earnings that blew past Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, shares of the at-home fitness giant surged 35%, closing at $4.55. Not too shabby for a company that‚Äôs been riding an emotional rollercoaster since the pandemic boom.

# Beating the Odds (and Estimates)

Peloton posted revenue of $644 million for the quarter ending June 30, a modest but meaningful uptick from last year and well above the $630 million analysts were bracing for. The company‚Äôs adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $70.3 million, flipping the script on last year‚Äôs $34.7 million loss and easily surpassing the $53.2 million analysts had forecasted.

So what‚Äôs behind the glow-up? Cost-cutting, baby. Peloton‚Äôs been trimming the fat‚Äîslashing expenses, cutting its workforce by 15%, and eking out $15 million in cost savings last quarter alone. The company is finally seeing green, not red, with a free cash flow of $26 million.

# The Ride Ahead: Smooth or Bumpy?

But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. Peloton‚Äôs forecast for the current quarter is a bit of a reality check. The company is predicting revenue between $560 million and $580 million‚Äîdown about 4% from last year and lower than analysts‚Äô expectations of $602 million. The subscriber base is also expected to shrink, with a 3% drop in users still sweating it out on Peloton hardware and a steeper 26% decline in paid app users.

And then there‚Äôs the search for a new CEO. With Barry McCarthy stepping down in May, Peloton‚Äôs leadership has been in a bit of limbo. Interim co-CEOs Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo are holding down the fort while the hunt for a new leader is ‚Äútop of mind for all stakeholders,‚Äù according to the company.

Despite the ups and downs, Peloton‚Äôs made it clear they‚Äôre in this for the long haul. The company acknowledges the road to recovery is still winding, especially with an unpredictable economy and the lingering question of whether people will stick with home workouts now that gyms are back in full swing.

So, while Peloton‚Äôs stock might be on a high right now, the real test will be whether they can keep the momentum going‚Äîor if this rally is just a quick burst of adrenaline.

This week‚Äôs headline event isn‚Äôt about the usual economic reports‚ÄîJerome Powell‚Äôs speech at Jackson Hole is stealing the spotlight.

Powell has been pretty guarded about his plans for monetary policy, so it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll drop any big hints about rate cuts before the Fed‚Äôs next meeting. But with the recent revision of 818K Jobs in nonfarm payroll data, investors are hungry for insights on the job market‚Äîsomething Powell might need to address if he wants to avoid triggering a market slide.

# Fed Flirts with a Rate Cut

The latest Fed minutes have everyone buzzing: Several officials hinted that a rate cut was on the table during their July meeting, but they ultimately decided to keep things steady. With inflation cooling off and unemployment edging higher, the Fed is now eyeing September as the likely time to hit the rate cut button. The central bank‚Äôs benchmark rate is sitting at a 23-year high, but the consensus is building that the economy might need a little relief sooner rather than later.

# The Inflation-Labor Market Tug-of-War

It‚Äôs a balancing act over at the Fed. On one side, inflation is showing signs of backing down, which is music to the ears of policymakers. On the other, the labor market is starting to look a bit shaky, with some Fed members worried that a slow-down in job growth could snowball into something more serious. The debate inside the Fed is shifting, with more focus on managing risks to the job market while keeping a watchful eye on inflation. The big takeaway? If the numbers keep trending the way they are, a rate cut in September seems almost inevitable.

# Markets Place Their Bets

Wall Street is already betting big on a September rate cut, and the Fed‚Äôs minutes have only fueled the fire. Futures markets are pricing in the first rate cut since the pandemic‚Äôs early days, and investors are gearing up for what could be a major shift in monetary policy. But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing‚Äîthere‚Äôs some political tension brewing. A rate cut so close to the presidential election could stir up controversy, especially since former President Trump has already voiced his opinion against it. On the flip side, some Democratic senators are pushing for the Fed to cut sooner, arguing that waiting too long could be just as politically charged.

Recent economic data has been a mixed bag, adding to the Fed‚Äôs conundrum. The July jobs report was weaker than expected, with hiring slowing down and unemployment ticking up to 4.3%. To make matters worse, a revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that payroll growth over the past year might have been overstated by over 800,000 jobs (more on this below). This paints a less rosy picture of the labor market, suggesting that it‚Äôs been cooling off for longer than anyone realized. At the same time, inflation seems to be easing off, giving the Fed some breathing room to consider easing up on rates.

# All Eyes on Jackson Hole

The Fed‚Äôs next move could set the tone for the economy as we head into the final stretch of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium, and his words will be under the microscope as markets and analysts try to decipher the Fed‚Äôs next steps. With a rate cut looking more and more likely, the focus will be on how quickly the Fed plans to ease up on rates and what that means for the broader economic outlook. Will the Fed go for a modest cut in September, or could we see something more aggressive? Stay tuned‚Äîthe stakes are high, and the markets are watching closely.

# Jobs Growth? Not So Fast

Turns out the labor market wasn‚Äôt as hot as we thought. The Bureau of Labor Statistics just revised down its previous nonfarm payroll growth estimates by a whopping 818,000 jobs for the year ending in March. That‚Äôs nearly a million fewer jobs than initially reported, translating to a 30% cut from the original numbers. Yikes! So much for that robust job market everyone was touting.

# The Reality Check

Initially, the BLS reported an average gain of 242,000 jobs per month during that period. Now, the revised figures suggest it was closer to 174,000‚Äîstill decent, but far less than what was expected. The biggest downward revisions hit sectors like professional and business services, hospitality, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, a few areas, such as private education, health services, and transportation, actually saw slight upward revisions. Overall, though, this marks the steepest revision since the financial crisis in 2009, signaling that the cracks in the labor market may have been forming much earlier than anyone realized.

This labor market revision throws another wrench into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs plans. With the job market cooling faster than expected, the pressure is mounting on the Fed to cut interest rates, and soon. Traders are already betting on a rate cut in September, with some even eyeing a half-point reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to address this at the Jackson Hole symposium, where all eyes will be on how the Fed plans to navigate this new data while trying to keep the economy on track.

# What It Means for the Economy

So, what‚Äôs the big picture? While the labor market is lagging, other parts of the economy, like consumer spending, are holding up better than expected. That might be why markets didn‚Äôt freak out today, with stocks staying in the green despite the job market bombshell. Economists weren‚Äôt entirely caught off guard, especially after the unemployment rate nudged up to 4.3% in July. But the new figures underscore the challenges ahead for Powell and his team as they weigh the risks of inflation against a softening labor market.

# Looking Ahead

These revised job numbers are still preliminary, with final revisions expected early next year‚Äîlong after the Fed has likely made its rate decisions. But for now, the takeaway is clear: The labor market isn‚Äôt as strong as it seemed, and the Fed‚Äôs task just got slightly trickier. As Powell and other central bankers prepare to meet at Jackson Hole, they‚Äôll need to rethink their strategy to balance a cooling job market with the broader economic outlook.



# Snowflake‚Äôs AI Buzz Falls Flat

# By the Numbers:

* **Revenue:**¬†$868.8 million (up 29% YoY)
* **Adjusted EPS:**¬†$0.18 per share (beat estimates of $0.16)
* **Net Loss:**¬†$317.77 million (or $0.95 per share)
* **Product Revenue:**¬†$829 million (up 30% YoY)

Snowflake Inc. tried to win over investors with its latest sales outlook, but the results didn‚Äôt exactly dazzle. Despite launching new AI-focused products, the company‚Äôs projections for the upcoming quarter came in below some of the more optimistic expectations, leaving investors unimpressed. Shares took a 7% dive in extended trading, capping off a rough year where the stock has already dropped 32%.

# Growing Pains

Under the leadership of new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has been busy rolling out tools aimed at the booming AI market. But the company is facing stiff competition from heavyweights like Databricks and Microsoft, and the pressure is starting to show. In the fiscal second quarter, Snowflake‚Äôs revenue grew by 29% to $868.8 million, marking the first time the company‚Äôs growth dipped below 30% since going public. And while product revenue increased by 30% to $829 million, it wasn‚Äôt enough to ease concerns about the company‚Äôs ability to keep pace in the AI race.

Snowflake did manage to raise its full-year product sales forecast to $3.36 billion, up from $3.3 billion, which sounds like good news‚Äîuntil you consider that some analysts had been hoping for even higher numbers. Meanwhile, the company‚Äôs net loss widened to $317.77 million, or $0.95 per share, significantly missing expectations. On the bright side, Snowflake added 1,000 new employees over the past year and now has 510 customers spending over $1 million annually.

# The Security Snafu

Adding to Snowflake‚Äôs woes, the company has been dealing with the fallout from a hacking incident that compromised client accounts, including big names like AT&T and Ticketmaster. While Snowflake insists its own systems weren‚Äôt breached, the negative headlines have done little to help investor sentiment. CEO Ramaswamy acknowledged the challenges, stating, ‚ÄúWe obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter,‚Äù but emphasized that the issue wasn‚Äôt on Snowflake‚Äôs end.

# The Road Ahead

Snowflake is clearly betting big on AI, but the road ahead is far from smooth. With tough competition, widening losses, and lingering security concerns, the company has a lot to prove. Investors are eagerly waiting to see if Snowflake can leverage its new AI products to regain momentum, but for now, the outlook remains cautious. As Ramaswamy pointed out, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge opportunity‚Äù ahead, but it‚Äôs going to take more than just buzzwords to calm investors‚Äô nerves.

# Breaking Up Google? DOJ Considers a Historic Move

Google ($GOOGL) has long reigned supreme with its trifecta of Search, Android, and YouTube, but its days of unchecked dominance might be numbered. After a federal court ruled that Google‚Äôs been playing monopoly with the internet search market, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering some drastic measures that could permanently alter Google‚Äôs empire‚Äîand send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# Google‚Äôs Breakup Drama

For the first time in over 20 years, the DOJ is mulling over the breakup of a major tech company, and Google‚Äôs in the crosshairs. This isn‚Äôt just a slap on the wrist; the DOJ is reportedly considering forcing Google to shed some of its most profitable assets. Imagine Google Ads‚Äîresponsible for a staggering $238 billion in 2023‚Äîbeing spun off into a separate entity. That‚Äôs just one option on the table. Another scenario could see Google being forced to sell off its Android operating system or Chrome browser, two products that are practically synonymous with the internet itself. The potential breakup could not only reshape Google but could also set a new precedent for regulating other tech giants.

# Flashback to Microsoft‚Äôs 2000 Antitrust Battle

If this all sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve seen something like this before. Back in 2000, the DOJ went after Microsoft for its near-total control over the PC market. While the attempt to break up Microsoft was eventually overturned on appeal, the case did lead to restrictions that slowed down the tech giant‚Äôs dominance just enough to allow new players‚Äîlike Google‚Äîto rise. Now, Google might find itself in a similar position. The DOJ could impose rules that force Google to share its valuable data and technology with competitors or ban it from entering exclusive contracts that keep rivals at bay. Case in point: Google‚Äôs $26 billion splurge to secure default search engine status on iPhones and Firefox. These kinds of practices could soon be a thing of the past.

# Silicon Valley on High Alert

While Google is currently the star of this antitrust drama, every other tech behemoth‚Äîfrom Amazon to Apple to Meta‚Äîis watching with bated breath. The outcome of Google‚Äôs case could have far-reaching consequences, especially as these companies face their own antitrust challenges. A decision to break up Google could embolden regulators to take a tougher stance across the board, fundamentally altering the landscape of the tech industry. The DOJ is set to reveal its proposed remedies in September, and until then, all of Silicon Valley is on edge, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.

# Walmart‚Äôs Winning Streak

Walmart ($WMT) just dropped some numbers, and it looks like they're riding high on the wave of deal-seeking shoppers. The retail giant raised its full-year sales outlook, now predicting a rise of up to 4.75%, a bump from its previous cap of 4%. Thanks to a growing number of customers‚Äîespecially those from higher-income brackets‚Äîscouring for bargains, Walmart's stock surged today, marking its biggest intraday gain since late 2022.

The real juice? E-commerce sales in the U.S. shot up by 22%, largely driven by pickups and Walmart‚Äôs third-party marketplace. This growth wasn‚Äôt just in the grocery aisles either; after 11 quarters of decline, general merchandise sales finally showed some life. Seasonal items like pool noodles were particularly popular‚Äîso much so that you could stretch all the noodles sold across 30,000 football fields. That‚Äôs a lot of backyard fun.

# Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

Walmart‚Äôs success contrasts sharply with other retailers like Home Depot ($HD) and Whirlpool ($WHR), which have been struggling as consumers put off big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to rake in customers across all income levels, including a significant chunk from wealthier households hunting for deals.

With the back-to-school season off to a strong start and inflationary pressures easing a bit, Walmart‚Äôs cautious optimism about the rest of the year seems well-placed. The retailer is focusing on keeping prices down, pushing suppliers to do the same, and expanding its high-margin businesses like advertising and membership programs. And with more shoppers tightening their belts and opting for at-home dining over takeout, Walmart‚Äôs grocery dominance is likely to continue driving growth.

# CPI Just¬†Dropped‚Ä¶

Inflation? More like deflation. The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report just hit, and it‚Äôs giving us the kind of cautiously optimistic vibes you get when something unexpectedly goes right‚Äîlike a pleasant surprise, but with a side of skepticism, because you're waiting to see if it‚Äôs too good to be true.

# What You Need to Know:

* **Core CPI**¬†(AKA inflation minus the wildcards like food and energy) rose 3.2% year-over-year‚Äîits chillest pace since early 2021. On a monthly basis, it edged up 0.2%, barely more than a rounding error compared to June‚Äôs numbers.
* **Overall inflation**¬†bumped up 0.2% for the month and 2.9% from last year‚Äîa number we haven‚Äôt seen since early 2021. Nearly 90% of that monthly increase is thanks to shelter costs, which are doing their best to keep inflation from becoming too boring.
* **As for the Fed?**¬†They‚Äôre still eyeing rate cuts like a kid in a candy store. Futures traders are betting on a full percentage point of cuts by year‚Äôs end, but a hefty 50-basis-point chop in September is looking less likely.

**The Housing Dilemma:**¬†Shelter costs are like that one guest who won‚Äôt leave the party. They were responsible for nearly all of July‚Äôs inflation bump, with the shelter index rising 0.4% after June‚Äôs 0.2% uptick. Meanwhile, car insurance costs soared 1.2%, and food prices edged up 0.2%. But hey, energy prices, new cars, clothes, and airfares all decided to give your wallet a break.

**Market Vibes:**¬†Wall Street barely flinched. Stock futures nudged upward, and Treasury yields inched higher. The yield curve flattened, suggesting the markets are still waiting to see if the Fed will play the role of Santa or the Grinch come September.

So, what‚Äôs next? Rate cuts are almost a done deal, but whether it‚Äôs a gentle 25-basis-point trim or a bold 50-pointer is still up in the air. Pro tip: If you‚Äôve got cash parked in high-yield accounts, you might want to lock in those rates now before they start shrinking faster than summer vacation.

# Mars To Acquire Kellanova for $36 Billion in Snack Power Play

# A Bold Bite

Mars Inc., the king of candy with a portfolio that includes M&M‚Äôs and Snickers, is making its biggest move in nearly a decade by acquiring Kellanova, the snack behemoth behind Pringles and Cheez-Its, for a jaw-dropping $36 billion. This blockbuster deal prices Kellanova at $83.50 per share‚Äîa hefty 33% premium over its August 2nd stock price. Mars is clearly betting big on the future of snacking, and it‚Äôs not just about satisfying cravings. With cocoa prices skyrocketing, Mars is looking to diversify away from its chocolate-heavy lineup.

# Snacking Strategy: Go Big or Go Home

Kellanova, which split from Kellogg ($K) last year, has been on a winning streak, outperforming rivals and enjoying a 33% surge in stock value this year alone. With its impressive portfolio of globally recognized brands and a strong presence in emerging markets, Kellanova is the perfect snack-sized addition to Mars‚Äô empire. Mars plans to double its snacking business over the next decade, leveraging Kellanova‚Äôs strength in regions like Africa while boosting its own presence in China. And don't worry, your favorite snacks like Cheez-Its and Pringles aren‚Äôt going anywhere‚ÄîMars has no plans to shake up the lineup.

# The Regulatory Maze

Now, about those potential roadblocks: While a deal of this magnitude usually sets off antitrust alarm bells, both Mars and Kellanova are confident they‚Äôll navigate the regulatory landscape with ease. The two companies have minimal overlap, which should help them avoid any major pushback. But if things don‚Äôt go as planned, Mars could be on the hook for a $1.25 billion breakup fee‚Äîa bitter pill to swallow. Still, analysts believe the deal will likely go through, setting the stage for more mergers and acquisitions in the snack industry as companies scramble to keep up with changing consumer tastes and the push for global expansion.

This acquisition isn‚Äôt just about adding a few more snacks to Mars‚Äô pantry‚Äîit‚Äôs about reshaping the future of the industry and staking a claim in the global market. As the saying goes, if you can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem, buy ‚Äòem.

  


# Cisco Slashes 7% of Workforce, but Earnings Surprise on the Upside

# By the Numbers:

Here‚Äôs the lowdown on Cisco‚Äôs latest quarterly report and restructuring moves:

* **Layoffs:**¬†7% of global staff (around 6,000 jobs)
* **Earnings:**¬†$0.87 per share (beating $0.85 expected)
* **Revenue:**¬†$13.64 billion (vs. $13.54 billion predicted)
* **Networking Revenue:**¬†Down 28% to $6.8 billion
* **Security Revenue:**¬†Up 81% to $1.8 billion
* **Splunk‚Äôs Impact:**¬†$960 million in revenue
* **Net Income:**¬†Down 45% to $2.2 billion
* **Stock:**¬†Down 10% YTD, but up 5.5% after hours

# The Layoff Shuffle

Cisco ($CSCO) is tightening its belt again, cutting 7% of its global workforce‚Äîabout 6,000 jobs‚Äîin a bid to save $1 billion. This is the second major round of layoffs for the tech giant this year, following a 5% reduction back in February. So why the cuts? Cisco says it‚Äôs all about redirecting resources to ‚Äúkey growth opportunities‚Äù and making the business more efficient. In plain English, it‚Äôs time to trim the fat and focus on what‚Äôs actually working as the company navigates some choppy waters.

# Revenue Down, but Not Out

Despite reporting its third straight quarter of declining revenue, Cisco managed to beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations. The company posted earnings of $0.87 per share, edging out the expected $0.85, while revenue came in slightly above forecasts at $13.64 billion. However, it‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows‚ÄîCisco‚Äôs bread-and-butter networking business is taking a hit, with revenue from switches and routers plummeting 28%. The ongoing shift of large enterprises to cloud services is eroding demand for Cisco‚Äôs traditional hardware, leaving the company scrambling to adapt.

# Splunk to the Rescue

Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. Cisco‚Äôs $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, a major player in data analytics and cybersecurity, is starting to pay off. The security segment saw an 81% surge in revenue, thanks in large part to Splunk, which contributed $960 million this quarter alone. As Cisco‚Äôs hardware sales continue to struggle, the company‚Äôs future seems increasingly tied to software and security. And the market seems to agree‚ÄîCisco‚Äôs stock popped 5.5% in after-hours trading, even though it‚Äôs still down 10% for the year.

Looking ahead, Cisco‚Äôs revenue slide isn‚Äôt expected to turn around overnight, but the company‚Äôs pivot toward more stable, subscription-based revenue through software and security could be its saving grace. For now, it‚Äôs all about weathering the storm and hoping that Splunk‚Äôs boost is enough to keep the ship afloat.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week still has a few reports left on the docket, but after today‚Äôs big CPI drop, the rest seem a bit underwhelming.

One key metric to keep an eye on is US retail sales, which are expected to tick up by about 0.3% for July. Retail sales have held up surprisingly well despite high inflation, helping the US dodge a recession so far. But if the job market is showing more cracks than expected, consumer spending could take a hit‚Äîand this report might reflect that shift.

We‚Äôll also get updates from the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, the Philly Fed Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, and the Import Price Index (think of it as the quirky cousin of CPI and PPI).

# Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO to Brew Up a Turnaround

Starbucks ($SBUX) just swapped out its CEO like a barista switching out coffee beans. Laxman Narasimhan is out, and Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle ($CMG) chief, is in. Investors responded like they‚Äôd just had a double shot of espresso‚Äîsending Starbucks stock up a whopping 24.5%.

# From Burrito Bowls to Coffee Cups

Niccol is no stranger to turning things around. At Chipotle, he led a massive comeback after the food-safety scandals, transforming the burrito chain into a digital ordering powerhouse and boosting its stock by about 800%. Now, he‚Äôs trading guac for frappuccinos, with the challenge of revamping Starbucks‚Äô sluggish sales and clunky operations.

# Brewing Up Big Changes

Starbucks has been struggling with long wait times and fewer customers, especially as inflation bites into coffee budgets. Narasimhan tried to caffeinate the company‚Äôs sales with higher-priced drinks and digital orders, but it backfired, leading to his abrupt exit.¬†Enter Niccol, who‚Äôs expected to bring some of his Chipotle magic‚Äîthink streamlined operations and a revamped digital experience that makes ordering and picking up your coffee as effortless as grabbing lunch on the go.

But it‚Äôs not all smooth sipping ahead. Niccol‚Äôs got to juggle the demands of activist investor Elliott Management and Starbucks‚Äô not-so-retired founder, Howard Schultz, who‚Äôs still lingering like the smell of burnt coffee beans. His mission? To deliver on some more realistic goals, unlike the lofty ones Schultz set, which sent Narasimhan packing.

# Chipotle‚Äôs Loss, Starbucks‚Äô Gain

Meanwhile, Chipotle‚Äôs stock took a hit, dropping 7.5% on fears that Niccol‚Äôs departure could shake up the burrito biz. But analysts are confident that the team Niccol built will keep Chipotle rolling.

So, should you bet on Starbucks? Wall Street seems to think so, with analysts upgrading their ratings faster than a barista pumps out pumpkin spice lattes. Niccol‚Äôs got the skills to grind out a Starbucks revival, but he‚Äôs got a tall order ahead. Stay tuned‚Äîit‚Äôs going to be a wild brew.

# CPI: The Fed‚Äôs Next Move Hangs in the Balance

Tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report is the main event everyone‚Äôs been waiting for‚Äîthink of it as the Super Bowl for inflation watchers. With today‚Äôs Producer Price Index (PPI) coming in cooler than expected, all eyes are now on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to see if inflation continues to ease up. Economists are expecting a 0.2% bump in both the headline and core CPI readings, with year-over-year inflation holding steady at 3%. If those numbers hit, the Federal Reserve might finally be able to shift its focus from fighting inflation to tackling other economic challenges‚Äîlike that pesky slowing labor market.

# What‚Äôs at Stake: A Green Light or a Roadblock?

Here‚Äôs why it matters: If CPI plays nice and comes in as predicted, it could be the green light for the Fed to start cutting interest rates, something Wall Street has been anxiously waiting for. The Fed has been in inflation-fighting mode for what feels like forever, but with the unemployment rate creeping up, there‚Äôs growing pressure for them to pivot. Jim Baird, Chief Investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, put it simply: ‚ÄúInflation is almost a nonissue at this point. There‚Äôs this broad expectation that the worst is easily behind us.‚Äù

But don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet. If CPI surprises us by coming in hotter than expected, it could throw a wrench in the works and reignite those dreaded stagflation fears‚Äîa combo of rising prices and slowing economic growth that‚Äôs basically the financial equivalent of a horror movie. While some experts think stagflation fears are overblown, a surprise in the CPI could still send markets into a tailspin and force the Fed to rethink its next move.

# The Fed‚Äôs Next Move: Rate Cuts or More Tightening?

So, what‚Äôs at stake? A lot. Markets are already pricing in a rate cut at the Fed‚Äôs September meeting, but tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report could either seal the deal or flip the script. If inflation stays on the down-low, the Fed might finally be able to take its foot off the gas. But if prices start heating up again, well, we might be in for a bumpy ride.



# Home Depot‚Äôs Reality Check: Deferral Mode Activated

# üõ†Ô∏è¬†By the Numbers:

* **Comparable Sales:**¬†Down 3.3% (7th consecutive quarterly decline)
* **Revenue:**¬†$43.18 billion (vs. $43.06 billion expected)
* **Earnings per Share:**¬†$4.67 (vs. $4.52 expected)
* **Outlook:**¬†Sales now expected to drop 3-4% this year (previously forecasted 1% decline)

Home Depot ($HD) is feeling the squeeze as consumers tighten their tool belts. Despite beating Wall Street‚Äôs expectations for earnings and revenue, the home improvement titan had to cut its full-year sales forecast, blaming a ‚Äúdeferral mindset‚Äù among customers who are holding off on major projects until interest rates stop giving them heartburn. It turns out, people aren‚Äôt as eager to remodel their kitchens when borrowing costs are sky-high.

# Seven Quarters of Slumps‚ÄîAnd Counting

Let‚Äôs talk numbers. Home Depot‚Äôs comparable sales have dipped for the seventh straight quarter, with a 3.3% decline this time around. Blame it on consumers who are spending less and waiting more. While pandemic lockdowns had everyone rushing to Home Depot to spruce up their spaces, today‚Äôs economic uncertainty has them second-guessing that new deck or bathroom redo. Instead, they‚Äôre opting for smaller, wallet-friendly projects‚Äîlike painting a wall instead of tearing it down.

# Betting Big on the Long Game

But it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom. Home Depot is playing the long game, investing in its professional customer base and digital capabilities to weather the storm. The recent $18 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution, a supplier to professional contractors, is a big move in that direction. These pros are less likely to delay projects, making them a more reliable revenue stream. Plus, with investments in supply chain and digital infrastructure, Home Depot is setting itself up for future growth once the economy gets its groove back.

So, while the immediate future might look a little shaky, Home Depot is banking on a rebound‚Äîwhenever that might be. In the meantime, they‚Äôll keep hammering away at those long-term strategies.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the spotlight shifts to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the big brother of today‚Äôs Producer Price Index (PPI) report.

CPI tracks the price changes of goods and services that hit your wallet directly. It‚Äôs a crucial gauge for the Federal Reserve as they monitor how their battle against inflation is shaping up. In June 2024, CPI climbed 3% year-over-year, following a 3.3% rise in May. For July, economists are betting on another 3% annual hike with a modest 0.2% increase from June.

Given the market‚Äôs volatility, a higher-than-expected CPI could trigger a wave of selling, while a lower number might spark investor enthusiasm, inching us closer to the Fed dialing back interest rates.

# Tesla Cybertruck Now Starts at $100K After Dropping Cheapest Model

Tesla ($TSLA) just gave the Cybertruck's price tag a serious jolt‚Äîif you were holding out for the ""affordable"" $60,990 model, you're out of luck. Tesla quietly pulled that version from its lineup, leaving the cheapest Cybertruck at a jaw-dropping $99,990. That‚Äôs a $39,000 leap from where the price floor used to be.

# The Price of Progress?

But wait, there‚Äôs more. The tri-motor Cyberbeast, the souped-up version that puts your foot to the floor with more torque and speed, now costs $119,990. That‚Äôs a $20K hike from just a week ago. Remember when Elon Musk promised a $39,990 Cybertruck back in 2019? Ah, simpler times. With the base model gone, it looks like Tesla is banking on buyers with deeper pockets and a taste for luxury‚Äîbecause clearly, the entry-level market isn‚Äôt a priority anymore.

# Fast Deliveries or Slowing Demand?

Tesla claims it‚Äôs speeding up delivery times, with AWD models potentially arriving as early as this month. But don‚Äôt let the expedited shipping fool you‚Äîthese price hikes might just be a sign that demand is cooling off faster than Musk anticipated. After all, how many folks are really ready to shell out six figures for a truck that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi flick?

Meanwhile, Cybertruck's bumpy road continues with recalls, sinking profits in Tesla's latest quarter, and a flurry of federal investigations. The dream of an affordable, mass-market EV truck seems further away than ever. Plus, faster deliveries could signal that Tesla's inventory is growing‚Äîa red flag that maybe, just maybe, those million pre-orders aren‚Äôt translating into actual sales.

# Trump Returns to X, $DJT Stock Takes a Hit

Donald Trump is back on X (formerly Twitter), and his reappearance is already shaking things up. Just ahead of a highly anticipated interview with Elon Musk, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) dipped 5%. The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, marks Trump‚Äôs first major return to the platform since August 2023. The question on everyone‚Äôs mind: What does this mean for Trump‚Äôs own social media platform, Truth Social?

# X Marks the Spot

Trump‚Äôs return to X is a big deal‚Äîafter all, this is the platform that played a huge role in his political rise. But there‚Äôs a twist. Trump previously vowed to stick to his own platform, Truth Social, after being banned from major social media sites. His comeback to X might signal a shift in strategy, especially with the 2024 election looming. And let‚Äôs not forget, this move comes after Musk‚Äôs recent endorsement of Trump, despite their very public beef just a couple of years ago.

# Stocks Stumble as the Spotlight Shifts

Trump‚Äôs return to X isn‚Äôt just about tweets‚Äîit‚Äôs affecting his wallet, too. Shares of Trump Media took a hit, dropping 5% on Monday. Investors seem to be questioning whether Trump‚Äôs renewed presence on X could spell trouble for Truth Social. After all, why would Trump‚Äôs followers stick around on his platform if he‚Äôs back to tweeting up a storm on X?

The timing couldn‚Äôt be more critical. Trump Media has been struggling financially, reporting a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter. With stocks already down nearly 50% since its public debut, the pressure is on.¬†



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors are bracing for a pivotal week of inflation data, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) report dropping on Tuesday, followed by the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a slight slowdown in July‚Äôs PPI, expecting a 0.1% monthly increase compared to June‚Äôs 0.2%. This could be an early indicator that inflation pressures on producers are easing, which might bring some optimism to the markets ahead of the CPI release.

As it stands, there‚Äôs a nearly even split among investors on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with current odds at 48%, down from 52% just a short time ago. All eyes are on these reports as they could heavily influence the Fed's next steps and the market's direction.

# Anduril‚Äôs $14B Game Plan: Autonomous Weapons Factories

The defense tech startup Anduril Industries, famous for being named after a fictional sword¬†used by¬†The Lord of the Rings¬†character Aragorn,¬†and founded by Oculus teen prodigy Palmer Luckey, just secured a cool $1.5 billion in new funding. This brings its valuation to a jaw-dropping $14 billion, just seven years after it launched. And what‚Äôs on their shopping list with all that cash? Autonomous weapons factories, because why build a regular factory when you can build one that churns out high-tech war machines like it‚Äôs no big deal?

# Cracking the Government Code

Anduril has quickly climbed the ranks to become a serious contender in the defense world, a sector where newcomers rarely survive, let alone thrive. The company has somehow cracked the government contract code by consistently delivering on time, on budget, and with tech that‚Äôs making the old guard sweat. They recently outmaneuvered giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing to snag a contract with the U.S. Air Force for developing uncrewed fighter jet prototypes. So yeah, Anduril is playing with the big boys now.

# Meet Arsenal-1: The Mega Weapons Factory

Now, let‚Äôs talk about Arsenal-1, Anduril‚Äôs planned 5-million-square-foot megafactory. This isn‚Äôt your average assembly line. Think of it as the Willy Wonka factory of autonomous military systems. The plan? Produce tens of thousands of these systems annually, with a workforce that could number in the thousands. Anduril‚Äôs Chief Strategy Officer, Chris Brose, says Arsenal-1 is just the start‚Äîthey‚Äôre already eyeing additional locations, including one abroad. The goal is to scale defense production in a way the industry hasn‚Äôt seen in decades, potentially saving the day when global conflicts demand rapid resupply.

# Why It Matters

The timing couldn‚Äôt be more critical. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has highlighted a glaring issue: the U.S. and its allies don‚Äôt have enough military equipment stockpiled for a prolonged conflict. Anduril‚Äôs ambitious plans to ramp up production are designed to address this shortfall. As Brose put it bluntly, ""America and our allies don‚Äôt have enough stuff."" With a global stage set for potential conflicts, investors are betting big on Anduril‚Äôs ability to deliver.

# What‚Äôs Next?

Expect Anduril to keep scaling, with the $1.5 billion war chest enabling them to expand their manufacturing capabilities and continue developing cutting-edge defense tech. The investors behind this latest funding round‚Äîincluding Sands Capital and Founders Fund‚Äîare clearly convinced that Anduril is the next big thing in defense. They‚Äôre not just throwing cash at a flashy startup; they‚Äôre betting on Anduril to reshape the future of military production. And with Arsenal-1 on the horizon, Anduril seems ready to do just that.

# Costco Cracks Down: Membership Scanners Coming to All Stores

Heads up, Costco ($COST) fans‚Äîyour days of sneaking into the warehouse without a membership card are officially numbered. Costco announced it's rolling out membership scanners at the entrances of all its locations. Over the coming months, instead of casually flashing your card at the door, you‚Äôll need to scan it, whether it‚Äôs physical or digital. And don‚Äôt even think about borrowing mom‚Äôs card for that sweet rotisserie chicken‚ÄîCostco‚Äôs tightening up its security.

# Card Sharing Crackdown

So, what‚Äôs behind this crackdown? Costco‚Äôs CFO Richard Galanti mentioned that since the pandemic, more people have been trying to sneak in using someone else‚Äôs membership. Not cool, folks. Costco isn‚Äôt playing games anymore. They‚Äôve already started testing these scanners earlier this year, and the results have them feeling confident about rolling them out nationwide.

This move isn‚Äôt just about keeping non-members out‚Äîit‚Äôs also about speeding things up inside. By scanning at the entrance, there‚Äôs no need for employees to check cards at registers or self-checkout, meaning a quicker in-and-out for everyone.

# Membership Fees: The Real Money Maker

Why is Costco so serious about memberships? Because that‚Äôs where the big bucks come from. Last year alone, Costco raked in $4.6 billion from membership fees. These fees are crucial to Costco‚Äôs profits, and with nearly 128 million members, the warehouse giant has a lot to protect. Starting September 1, those fees are going up for the first time since 2017. The basic Gold Star membership will rise from $60 to $65, while the Executive Membership jumps from $120 to $130. Plus, the maximum 2% reward for Executive members will increase to $1,250 from $1,000.

# What It Means for You

If you‚Äôre a member, make sure to bring your card‚Äîand a photo ID if your membership doesn‚Äôt include a picture‚Äîevery time you visit. Guests? They‚Äôll still need to be accompanied by a member to get in. This move is Costco‚Äôs latest effort to ensure that only paying members enjoy the perks, like that famous $1.50 hot dog combo.

So next time you‚Äôre headed to Costco, don‚Äôt forget your card. With these new scanners, Costco is serious about keeping its benefits exclusive‚Äîand its lines moving faster.

But if it disappoints, brace yourself for more turbulence.

# Is It Safe to Breathe Again, Investors?

If your inbox was flooded yesterday with anxious messages from friends fretting over their stock portfolios or colleagues worried about their 401(k)s, you weren‚Äôt the only one.

# Is the Storm Over?

Monday's market madness had investors around the globe in a frenzy, thanks to a perfect storm of economic jitters. The chaos started with unsettling employment data hinting that the Fed‚Äôs efforts to cool the economy might be working too well. Add to that a massive unwind of a popular carry trade in Japan and some AI-related profit-taking, and you had a recipe for a sea of red in the markets.

But just as quickly as the losses came, they started to fade. Tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft, which were among the biggest losers yesterday, have already bounced back into positive territory.

# Staying Steady in Unsteady Times

So, is the storm over? Not so fast. While yesterday's selloff seemed more about fear than fundamentals, the broader economic landscape remains shaky. The Fed hasn‚Äôt budged on interest rates yet, despite growing speculation that they‚Äôll roll out a hefty rate cut in September to calm things down.

Wall Street pros are warning that we‚Äôre likely in for more turbulence before any rate cuts materialize. And though a half-point cut seems to be the consensus, these are the same folks who predicted six rate cuts at the start of the year‚Äîso take their forecasts with a grain of salt.

# The Takeaway?

Don‚Äôt let market swings scare you into cashing out. Analysts stress that volatility is no reason to hit the eject button, especially after the strong gains we've seen this year. A little bumpiness is par for the course.

And if we‚Äôre not at the market‚Äôs bottom yet, this might just be the chance to buy into sectors like AI, which have been sky-high in recent months.

In short, hang tight and keep your cool.There are plenty of other things to lose sleep over, like whether your favorite streaming service is about to hike prices again or why that meme stock you bought for fun is suddenly your biggest holding.

# Google Gets the Monopoly Hammer: What‚Äôs Next?

# The Verdict Is In

In a ruling that could shake up the tech world, a federal judge has declared that Google ($GOOGL) is, indeed, an illegal monopoly. Judge Amit Mehta didn‚Äôt mince words, stating, ‚ÄúGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.‚Äù This is a major win for the Department of Justice, which has been chasing Google for years, accusing the tech giant of smothering competition in search and advertising.

But hold your horses‚Äîthis is just the beginning. The next phase will decide what happens to Google. Will it be slapped on the wrist with a fine, or could it face a breakup? While the latter sounds juicy, it‚Äôs probably not going to happen. Google‚Äôs appealing the ruling, so this could drag out longer than your latest Netflix binge.

# Big Tech's Turn in the Hot Seat

Google isn‚Äôt the only tech giant sweating right now. Amazon ($AMZN), Apple ($AAPL), and Meta ($META) are all facing similar antitrust scrutiny. Regulators argue that these companies have been acting like playground bullies, pushing around smaller rivals and favoring their own products. The Google ruling could set the stage for how these cases unfold, but whether it‚Äôll lead to actual change remains to be seen.

# Investors Hit Snooze

While the ruling is big news, investors don‚Äôt seem too concerned. Alphabet‚Äôs stock dipped a bit with the rest of the market but quickly bounced back. Analysts like Wedbush‚Äôs Dan Ives aren‚Äôt expecting any major disruptions to Google‚Äôs operations in the near term, so it looks like business as usual‚Äîfor now.

So, what‚Äôs next? We‚Äôre all just waiting to see if this ruling will actually make a dent in Google‚Äôs search dominance or if it‚Äôs just another chapter in the ongoing saga of Big Tech vs. The World.

* **Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs):**¬†156 million (up 14% YoY)
* **Total Trips:**¬†2.77 billion (up 21% YoY)

# Zooming Past Expectations

Uber ($UBER) put the pedal to the metal in Q2, delivering earnings that sped past Wall Street‚Äôs forecasts. The company reported 47 cents per share, outpacing the expected 31 cents, while revenue came in at $10.7 billion, topping predictions. With its mobility unit seeing a 23% surge in gross bookings and delivery bookings rising 16%, Uber‚Äôs growth engine is firing on all cylinders.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was riding high, noting that Uber‚Äôs monthly active platform consumers reached 156 million, a 14% increase from last year, with 2.77 billion trips during the quarter. The market took notice, sending Uber‚Äôs stock up 10.9% following the report.

# Looking Ahead

For the third quarter, Uber is forecasting gross bookings between $40.25 billion and $41.75 billion, with adjusted earnings expected to land between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion. While the midpoint is just shy of analysts' estimates, it still signals that Uber expects to keep cruising along smoothly.

# The Road to Autonomous

Khosrowshahi didn‚Äôt shy away from addressing Tesla‚Äôs ($TSLA) potential robotaxi threat. He assured investors that Uber‚Äôs partnerships with Waymo and other AV players put it in a prime position to dominate the autonomous vehicle space. Uber‚Äôs platform, he emphasized, is unmatched in its ability to offer AV companies the scale they need without the headache of building their own network.

After a rough start to the year, Uber‚Äôs stock is gaining traction. With a focus on innovation and expansion, Uber seems ready to stay ahead in the race for the future of transportation.¬†

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

With recession jitters on the rise, all eyes are on the labor market. But while jobs bring in the cash, it‚Äôs the way Americans spend it that really tells the story. As spending slows‚Äîthanks in large part to sky-high inflation‚Äîcompanies start to feel the pinch, forcing McDonald‚Äôs to keep those $5 deals on the menu a bit longer.

That‚Äôs why tomorrow‚Äôs consumer credit report is so important: it‚Äôs a snapshot of not just how much people are spending, but also how much debt they‚Äôre piling up‚Äîthe good (mortgages) and the not-so-good (credit cards). Normally, this report flies under the radar, but this time it could be key in shaping monetary policy in the coming months.

# Before Market Open:¬†

* Disney ($DIS) has hit some turbulence lately, with sky-high prices at theme parks, fierce streaming competition, and cautious consumer spending weighing it down. But recent box office wins have revived some optimism, and Wall Street still believes in the Magic Kingdom: 21 out of 26 analysts rate the stock as a ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù with a target price about 40% higher than its current level. Consensus: $1.19 EPS, $23.05 billion in revenue.
* Shopify ($SHOP) has had a rough 2024, with its stock nosediving due to worries over slowing consumer spending, challenging economic conditions for small businesses, and declining revenue. Investors are eager for signs of a turnaround this quarter, and given the stock‚Äôs current valuation, it might just catch the eye of bargain hunters. Consensus: $0.20 EPS, $2.01 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* Robinhood ($HOOD) blew past analyst expectations last quarter, delivering an EPS of $0.18 versus the expected $0.05. Investors are crossing their fingers for a repeat performance this quarter, though volatility in cryptocurrencies‚Äîa favorite among Robinhood traders‚Äîcould put a dent in trading revenue and profits. Consensus: $0.15 EPS, $631.82 million in revenue.

**Fed Keeps Rates Steady, But September Cut Looms**



Jerome Powell took center stage at the Fed‚Äôs July meeting, setting the scene for what could be a rate-cutting September‚Äîif the data plays nice. While Powell didn‚Äôt drop any explicit hints, his optimism on falling inflation and a cooling labor market has Wall Street betting on a September rate decision.

Here‚Äôs the scoop:

September Cut in the Cards? Powell kept things ambiguous but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The Fed had a ‚Äúnice conversation‚Äù about it, and while a 50 basis-point move isn‚Äôt likely, Powell left the door open for action if conditions warrant.

A Delicate Balancing Act: Powell described the decision-making process as a ‚Äúvery difficult judgment call,‚Äù outlining scenarios from multiple cuts to none at all. The plan? If inflation keeps easing, growth holds steady, and the job market doesn‚Äôt fall apart, a cut could be on the horizon.

Dovish Vibes: Powell‚Äôs remarks leaned more dovish than the official FOMC statement. With inflation risks decreasing and the labor market softening, he‚Äôs still banking on a soft landing for the economy.

Market Reactions: The stock market loved it, with the S&P 500 inching towards its best day since February. Treasury yields dipped, and the dollar slid as traders began pricing in at least two rate cuts by year‚Äôs end.

Patience, Grasshopper: Despite the growing anticipation, Powell emphasized patience. The Fed‚Äôs dual mandate‚Äîcurbing inflation while keeping employment high‚Äîrequires careful maneuvering. Investors might need to wait for the weather (and rates) to cool down.

So, as summer sizzles on, the Fed‚Äôs next move is still in the oven. Keep an eye on those labor market stats and inflation readings; they‚Äôre the key ingredients for what happens in September.

  
**Meta's Q2: The Zuck Strikes Back**

Meta ($META) is having a moment. Shares popped nearly 7% in after-hours trading after the company not only beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations but also threw down a strong forecast for Q3. So, what‚Äôs driving the hype? Let's dive in.

By the Numbers

Earnings per Share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected

Q3 Revenue Forecast: $38.5 billion to $41 billion

Ad Revenue Growth: 22% year-over-year

Reality Labs Loss: $4.5 billion this quarter

Operating Margin: 38%, up from 29% a year ago

2024 Share Performance: Up 34% year-to-date

Core Business Keeps Delivering

Despite all the chatter about the metaverse and Reality Labs burning through cash like it‚Äôs going out of style (a $4.5 billion loss this quarter, no less), Meta's core business‚Äîdigital advertising‚Äîcontinues to deliver. Ad revenue alone soared 22% year-over-year, driven largely by the Facebook and Instagram power duo. That‚Äôs more than double what rival Alphabet ($GOOGL) pulled off with its ad sales.

On the spending side, Meta's AI and virtual reality ambitions are no small potatoes. The company is shelling out big bucks on infrastructure, with expenses expected to surge even more in 2025 as they continue to scale up. But with AI being the buzzword of the year, investors are keeping a close eye on when those hefty investments will start paying off.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's head honcho, is bullish. He‚Äôs not only talking up Meta AI as potentially the most used AI assistant by year-end but also boasting about their Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (because nothing says futuristic like AI-infused eyewear). Plus, Meta‚Äôs open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is making waves in the tech world, pushing the company to the forefront of the AI race.

The Reality Labs Money Pit

Even with all this success, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Reality Labs, Meta‚Äôs bet on the metaverse, is still a money pit, and the legal bills are piling up too. The recent $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition data is a reminder that Meta's past still haunts it.

But for now, Zuckerberg's 2023 ""year of efficiency"" mantra is paying off. Meta‚Äôs operating margin jumped to 38%, and the company‚Äôs cost-cutting measures seem to be hitting the right notes with investors. With shares up 34% for the year, double that of the Nasdaq, Meta's comeback story is one for the books.

**On The Horizon**

All eyes were glued to the FOMC announcement today, but now that the dust has settled, things are cooling off as we head into the rest of the week. We‚Äôre still on the lookout for updates with weekly jobless claims, which will shed more light on the labor market, while Q2 nonfarm productivity, ISM manufacturing, and the S&P US manufacturing PMI will offer insights into how the manufacturing sector is faring this month.

On the earnings front, there‚Äôs still plenty of action to keep an eye on.

**Before Market Open:**

Anheuser-Busch Inbev ($BUD) has seen its stock slide over the last year, largely due to a customer boycott following a controversial ad campaign. Adding salt to the wound, competitors like Diageo are also reporting weaker alcohol sales as consumers tighten their belts. Despite these challenges, BUD's brand power remains strong, and Wall Street is still optimistic, with an average analyst price target 26% higher than current levels. Expectations: $0.87 EPS, $13.56 billion in revenue.

Ferrari ($RACE) might seem like it‚Äôs in the same boat as other luxury brands dealing with consumers cutting back, but not so fast. Ferrari buyers aren‚Äôt feeling the pinch of inflation like most folks, and analysts believe the company will keep raking in the profits. Expectations: $2.23 EPS, $1.74 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close:**

Apple ($AAPL) made waves in June at its WWDC event, unveiling AI projects, new phone upgrades, payment services, and more. This earnings report will give investors a closer look at how these new ventures are impacting the bottom line. Wall Street remains bullish, with just one out of 35 analysts rating Apple a ‚Äúsell.‚Äù Expectations: $1.34 EPS, $84.36 billion in revenue.

Amazon (AMZN) hasn‚Äôt seen the same sky-high gains as some other tech giants this year, but investors are still confident in its cloud business, post-pandemic profitability, and AI initiatives. And if you thought the love for Apple was strong, every one of the 39 analysts covering Amazon rates it a ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù Expectations: $1.03 EPS, $148.57 billion in revenue.",08-01-2024

# Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade

In a classic case of ‚Äúso close, yet so far,‚Äù Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company‚Äôs disappointing Azure cloud revenue.

Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints

Microsoft‚Äôs revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure‚Äôs performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue‚Äîjust shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub‚Äôs impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn‚Äôt enough to quell investor concerns.

By the Numbers

Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected

Market Reaction and Future Outlook

While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft‚Äôs other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure‚Äôs growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn‚Äôt enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft‚Äôs shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500‚Äôs 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market‚Äôs laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

**Chips Ahoy! AMD‚Äôs Data Center Sales Surge 115%**

AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let‚Äôs break it down.

Earnings Breakdown

AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter

AI Chips and Data Center Dominance

The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company‚Äôs overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.

Other Segments and Market Reaction

While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD‚Äôs business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year

AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.

**On The Horizon**

Tomorrow‚Äôs labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week‚Äôs job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.

**Before Market Open**

**Boeing ($BA)**: Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.

**Marriott International ($MAR)**: The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close**

**Meta Platforms ($META)**: Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta‚Äôs spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

**Arm Holdings ($ARM)**: With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm‚Äôs valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",07-30-2024

Rate Cut Countdown ‚Äî Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger?

Nope, the Fed isn‚Äôt cutting rates this week. But don‚Äôt snooze just yet‚Äîthis meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn‚Äôt overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy‚Äîhe's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.

Inflation: Cooling Off

Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year‚Äôs 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We‚Äôre on the right track, folks.
Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it‚Äôs taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell‚Äôs recent take? The labor market isn‚Äôt adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù‚Äîbalancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.

Risk Management Reboot

With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed‚Äôs risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle‚Äîslightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed‚Äôs past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they‚Äôre determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.

Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it‚Äôs time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn‚Äôt seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.

The Fed‚Äôs balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.


McDonald‚Äôs: The Golden Arches Stumble

By the Numbers

Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)
Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)
Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)
U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%
International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%
International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%

McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.

Value Meals to the Rescue

The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn‚Äôt translated into higher overall sales just yet.

Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.

Defying the Odds

Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.

Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell.

Looking Forward

The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.

So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

On The Horizon

Tomorrow
Economic Data and Earnings

This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.

Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.

Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry.

Let‚Äôs unpack everything that‚Äôs happened in the markets this week:

Ethereum ETFs Get the Green Light: The SEC has finally given the thumbs up to spot ethereum ETFs, allowing investors to buy into funds that track real ethereum, not just futures. These fresh funds pulled in a cool $951 million in trading volume on their second day‚Äîpretty impressive for what's typically a sleepy investment vehicle.

Inflation Cools Down: More inflation data came in cooler than expected. June‚Äôs PCE showed prices increased just 0.1% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year. This slowdown has investors buzzing that the Fed might actually cut rates in September, according to the FedWatch Tool.

Tech‚Äôs Rollercoaster Week: Tesla and Alphabet‚Äôs disappointing earnings reports set off a market-wide selloff on Wednesday, shaving over a trillion dollars off the market. The bright side? Other sectors are doing pretty well, even if tech's outsized presence in the indexes makes it hard to notice. Tech stocks are already starting to claw back some of their losses.

Busy Week Ahead for Markets

Next week promises to be a pivotal one for the markets. Not only are we hitting the peak of earnings season, but we'll also hear from the Federal Open Market Committee regarding the central bank's plans for interest rate cuts.

Following today's PCE announcement, much of Wall Street anticipates a rate cut in September. However, the most optimistic investors are hopeful that the Fed will surprise everyone and initiate cuts this month. Given that the Fed has stated rate cuts will be data-dependent, it's more likely that Jerome Powell and his team will want to gather additional data before making any decisions.

On the data front, most of next week's economic reports will focus on employment. The JOLTS report comes out on Tuesday, ADP on Wednesday, and the US jobs report on Friday.

Earnings Next Week:

Monday: McDonald's ($MCD), ON Semiconductor ($ON), Chesapeake Energy ($CHK), Tilray Brands ($TLRY), and Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM).

Tuesday: Procter & Gamble ($PG), Merck ($MRK), Pfizer ($PFE), Microsoft ($MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), BP ($BP), PayPal ($PYPL), Corning ($GLW), Starbucks ($SBUX), and Pinterest ($PINS).

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - Adjusted EPS is $.52, missed estimates for fourth consecutive quarter. Also confirmed by Musk that he‚Äôs pushing back Robotaxi event to October. Despite the earnings miss, revenue beat expectations ($25.5B). Also announced manufacture of new, lower-cost cars in first half of next year. Musk also announced he‚Äôs going to pare down his commitment to give $45M a month to the ex-President T.

[**CRWD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWD&p=d) - Fourth day of trading since the outage- we saw a GREAT trade yesterday at the open when CRWD sold off from 269->260 and bounced back- going to be watching to see if anything similar like that happens today. Currently long.

[**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) - Beat estimates as cloud business grows, but AI losses grow. EPS of 1.89 vs 1.85e and revenue of $84.7B vs $84.3B. Some Jefferies analyst spoke that meaningful AI revenue is more likely to be a 2025-2026 event.

Note that the quarterly revenue missing is EXTREMELY rare for V, thus the selloff for the stock despite beating estimates. Overall signals weakness for the credit card giants because AXP missed earnings last week as well.

WHY TESLA'S Q2 2024 EARNINGS WILL EXCEED EXPECTATIONS ? Let's goo tesla ??,07-23-2024
"Im a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 22/07 as tech looks for a bounce in premarket. ANALYSIS:

* **Understand that whilst vix is up, it is a case of positioning and squeeze rather than genuine concern in market. The other risk gage, credit default swaps Continues to go lower. Suggests this pullback won't be sustained. This is not looking like start of a deep correction even though technicals look weaker.** Geopolitical noise etc obviously isn't a major concern else credit swaps would be rising.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OGJIzGB](https://imgur.com/a/OGJIzGB)¬†
* On VIX: we saw a big jump last week. This was mostly due to OPEX, and the Vix expiration, which removed a lot of the put delta which was suppressing VIX. I Expect that VIX will get crushed again soon, but looking at the positioning it doesnt look ready to crush meaningfully just yet. I say this because the term structure is in backwardation, and look at the positioning, skewed to OTM calls, not ITM puts which is what we have been used to.¬†
* [https://imgur.com/a/90V7XPV](https://imgur.com/a/90V7XPV)
* AS mentioned, we probably need news catalyst to remove this call delta.¬†
* Nonetheless, higher VIX doesnt mean equities can‚Äôt move higher. As I mentioned before, this is normal seasonal action for VIX to rise at this time of the year.¬†
* NVDA: we have seen NVDA price action weak of late, dragged with other semis and mega caps in general. However, as Goldman Sachs and CIti point out, I think this kind of sell off is dangerous for bears. Goldman Have already pointed out that NVDA are expected to release a few new updates in their earnings report and will also explain how their AI chips are helping companies to make money. This will be a bullish catalyst. Positioning shows mostly bearish flows. This flow is probably ready to get squeezed soon IMO based on fundamental catalysts. We have seen it all year on every pullback, I think this time is no different.¬†
* GOLD:
* Positioning overall is weakening, as traders hedge, hence price action falling. We have called that since last week. However, on August expiry, we see traders are still bullish. Just hedging in the near term, but overall, with rate cuts coming, should see gold perform still.



DATA LEDE:

* China cut the 1 year loan prime rate to 3.35% vs the expectation to maintain at 3.45%
* Cuts the 5 year loan prime rate to 3.85%, vs expectation to maintain at 3.95%
* So in both cases, we saw a cut by 10bps, against expectations.¬†



MARKETS:¬† Nasdaq outperforming as much of the premarket action being driven by NVDA, semis and AAPL.¬†

* SPX: Tested 5500 on Friday, but closed above. Today is trading higher following B.iden stepping down as presidential candidate. Trading at 5539.¬†
* Nasdaq:¬† Trading up 0.8% in premarket. Closed On Friday just above the 50D MA, today moving higher by 0.9%, is trading at 19,700.¬†
* Dow Jones: Flatter than others, as most of the-market action is in semis.¬†
* Ger40: trading higher by 1.5% Trading at 18,430. Above the 18,350 support. Positioning is strong.¬†
* HKG50: trading higher after PBOC cuts prime rate by 10bps against expectations.¬†
* Gold: Slightly lower, trading below 2400. Positioning showing hedging but should recover soon.¬†
* Oil - slightly lower on weakening positioning and excess supply.¬†

"What do I do with my Tesla optionThis morning I bought one tesla call with a strike price of $257.5, the contract went for $8.85 (now going for $5.65) and it was ITM at the time. I held the contract even as tesla fell hoping that it'd make a move back up (I didn't follow my SL). When market closed today I was down $320 on the paper account that had $1180 before I took this trade. The contract expires July 19th. Although it's a paper account I want to treat this as if it's real money and that's why I'm making this post. What do you all think I should do? Right now my plan is to see the first three hours of tomorrows market and if it isn't looking bullish I'll cut my losses. Is that a good idea or should I give it more time. I'm thinking I'll cut my losses if they exceed $400. Overall what do you guys think would be best for me to do?",07-15-2024
"All the market moving news this morning, and some set ups to watch. 10/07ANALYSIS:

* **CPI is expected to come soft as shown by positioning in dollar being soft and gold being strong, so** we likely see move higher through 5600 after CPI. 
* **Short term positioning on TLT supports. Hedged but bullish, another sign traders expect CPI to come soft. Lets see.** 
* [**https://imgur.com/a/LpuUCdz**](https://imgur.com/a/LpuUCdz)¬†
*  **NVDA: Vol skew points higher. Positioning looks far more bullish now into August as bears basically got squeezed and were forced to close positioning. We see strong call delta ITM and OTM. Positioning has improved, increasing on 140 and 150.**
* [**https://imgur.com/a/Vl94GuZ**](https://imgur.com/a/Vl94GuZ)¬†
* HOOD:
* **HOOD: pared the gains yesterday, to close inside the triangle. Hence no breakout yet, but positioning still looks good. BTC is up, and we SHOULD get a soft CPI tomorrow, so the fundamentals, positioning and technicals should align for move higher soon. Target still 25.**

"Is crypto bull cycle this time different?Is there something new in this bull cycle that the altcoins are not performing well and are still dry? Layer 1 Blockchains have performed way better than rest of the altcoins.

This bull cycle is giving out a different vibe than the ones we have seen before. Lot of inflows were seen in big projects while the altcoins with low cap still have low liquidity and no serious gains. Your crypto portfolio with big market cap projects would have performed way better than 50x/moon coins.

**What could be the reason?**

1. Experienced investors are reducing risk and going after high liquidity.
2. New retail investors have not entered this bull cycle.
3. Lot of people with shitcoins have converted them into heavy weight coins.
4. Are we becoming smart :D

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA‚Äôs manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA‚Äôs market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",06-12-2024
"Smart Contracts vs. Top Stocks!Curious how a Smart Contracts portfolio stacks up against traditional investments? We all know NVIDIA is an exception! But the gains seem to be outrageous when compared to all the top stocks and market indexes.

I wanted to hear any personal crypto portfolio insights vs your stock portfolios.

"10/06 Premarket cheat sheet - all the news, catalysts and stock specific updates driving price action today, and some potential expectations for the week ahead. ANALYSIS:

* On Monday Tuesday, I expect probably more choppiness until the Fed. We probably see a similar choppiness to on Friday last week, with oscillation around 5350. key levels are 5350 as the pivot. 5325 will be an area of support. Probably see oscillation in range of 5300-5400, but let's see. i will post levels more precisely daily during the week. Potential risks to that are a post NVDA stock split, but positioning for the market remains bullish for now.
* CPI - Now most of the data sources I am watching suggest that CPI probably comes in line or soft. But regardless, the main event will be the FOMC.
* Basically, volatility is in very steep contango. This means that vol sellers are sitting there absolutely ready to crush volatility down. This means that if Vol spikes after FOMC/CPI, probably we see a vix crush and we may see bears getting squeezed. This could make for a nice buy the dip.
* Market appears to be expecting a more dovish Powell from what I am reading.
* Possibly could be a non event, or a catalyst for a squeeze imo. Obviously if he comes super hawkish, I can be wrong, but the volatility set up does strike me as the fact that any sell off will be a nice buy the dip opporutnity.
* Personally, I expect him to say that they will bring inflation down, full commitment, remain month by month data driven approach. Will probably say that they are expecting inflation to be more difficult to get down than before, which can be enough to make the amrket drop initially, but I do think he will point to weakness in the labour market and suggest that they are monitoring it, and that if it gets weaker it can be reason to cut rates. This then could lead to the bears having to unwind positions, vix crush, and a squeeze higher.
* IF powell is dovish, IWM will probably be one of the trades to be in.

DAta lede:

* Japanese GDP price index comes 3.4% YOY vs forecast of 3.6%. Previous reading was 3.7%
* SO prices are lower than expected, not good for inflation hopes, so points to more dovish BOJ.
* GDP annualised growth was -1.8% vs -1.9% expected.¬†

* Nasdaq: Flat around 19,000. After jobs numbers on Friday, it dropped to 18,900, before recovery to 19,100. Fell to close around 19000, which is where it is trading now after dropping earlier in premarket.¬†

"About margin interest I know there‚Äôs no interest charge if you closed your position in the end of day.  For example, I have a 100k account, I bought Tesla stock for 100k and sold it right away when I had profits.  Repeat the same process 8 times.  So I traded total amount 800k intraday.   If I decided to hold the position(100k)  overnight , how does the brokers charged the interest? Do they charge the interest 
For the 700k you use for the trading? Or do they charge the 100k for the interest? Or they charged nothing since you don‚Äôt hold 2x position?  Thank you for anyone who can answer the question ",06-07-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket, including full expectations for NFP based on the positioning data and a look at VIX. ANALYSIS AND EXPECTATIONS BASED ON POSITIONING FOR THE DAY:

* Eurusd skew points higher today and in near term expires. The main learning we take from this is that traders expect dollar to fall today. Aka they expect soft jobs numbers.¬†
* If we look at chfusd similar, v bullish skew. Is v positive for chf as it breaks out, but also tells us traders expect dollar to fall.
* If we are to see this, we can see SPX reach 5390-5400 as we can see a squeeze higher. From there, it depends on the report as to whether we bounce from here or break higher, which will crate more squeeze. Realistically, expectation is bounce from here.¬†
* If we look at VIX, there is a strong wall at 12.5. That will be hard to break, but is v possible on weak NFP.¬† Some hedging form traders, they are basically trying to cover themselves against hot jobs numbers surprise by buying calls on VIX, but if we look at term structure we see its in contango. Traders are not expecting volatility, traders are still short on VIX. VIX is expected to fall and equities should rise.¬†
* Key pivot is the 5350 level.
* Below that we have 5335 as a key level
* And 5300 is the level where gamma turns negative. Break below here can lead to more downside, but this will eb a strong support.¬†
* For a down day, we‚Äôd need to see break below the 5335 level with VIX rising, otherwise we probably just see vix crush later in the day, which will fuel recovery and dips to be bought.¬†
* At the same time, Gold positioning was bullish last night as price action was starting to recover, but the fundamental news that China is halting its gold buying for reserves after an 18 month stretch of buying has sent it lower. Realistically, we can expect it to be weak today, or in near future on this. But if NFP comes weak this will help to limit the decline in short term.¬†

DATA LEDE:

* Japan Household spending comes in slightly below expectations at 0.5% YOY vs forecasts for 0.6% YOY increase.
* MOM came weak.¬†
* So Japanese household spending came weaker than expected. However, it‚Äôs worth noting, that despite this, it is the first month in the last year that YOY household spending came at least positive.¬†

How do taxes work for buying and selling stocks in general? Not necessarily day trading. I started investing overall recently and I made trades in my Roth IRA so I don't think I need to worry about taxes in this case. But for regular investment accounts say you bought Tesla at 170 dollars and it goes to 200 and sell. You earn 30 dollars. But then imagine 2 months from now you make a new trade bought Tesla or whatever company at 180 and  sold at 100 to cut your losses. Do you still pay taxes on the 30 dollars even though you are down overall? And would it be at the same tax bracket as your other income? Or is it based on how much you earn overall by the end of the year during tax time. How would these factors differ if it was a day trade vs several months.  I know there is something called washsale rule or wahtever but as long as you don't claim losses for deduction then it shouldn't matter right?,05-24-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is my full pre market cheat sheet, including full positioning updates for SPX and QQQ following yesterdays dip. Whats changed in the market? **24/05**

ANALYSIS: 

* Key economic data to come today, with inflation expectations and Durable goods.
* Skew and positioning on EURUSD points higher, so expectation is for dollar to fall form key level of 105, but lets see.¬†
* SPX Skew points higher, QQQ closed above 450 wall which is supportive. SPX shows increasing call volume, and some put selling.¬†
* Probably see lower volatility today as IV remains lower, but traders are still bullish and it looks like today will be a choppy day with upward direction, but lets see.¬†
* 5300 wall.¬†
* Positioning unchanged after yesterday. Basically no impact, market brushed it off it seems. But lets see with the data.¬†

Update on yesterday:

* If we saw on spx last few days there was some hedging some hedging prior to fomc and nvda in previous updates but bullish positioning overall.
* Even though nvda earnings came decent, and I'd say decent rather than amazing because of gross margin guidance, market still sold off because of hawkishness of yday fomc minutes plus some China Taiwan fears which r overblown for sure. Also PMI data came strong as did Jobless claims, which got traders doubting rate cuts again.
* Bsically, traders were taking this as an opportunity to trim, ahead of holiday weekend and using the ample liquidity there on NVDA earnings. Premarket moves dont always predict market open moves btw. Premarket has low volume and often fools investors, so whilst SPX and QQQ pumped in premarket, you had to look in the first half an hr, especially after jobless claims came hot to understand what the market is doing.
* Institutions are still long on this market btw. Id take this as a look that lots of stocks starting to present opportunities again as the market pulls back.
* BTW pull back is even a bit mcuj to say. The Iran pullback was a pullback, this is a 1% dip from ATH.
* Still, for me I think there are things that now look more attractive, some in semis, smci, crypto miners, many industrial names as dow comes back to 39k.
* Would still bet on 5300 return. More later

  
BTW gold and silver positioning looks like a BUy the dip coming.   


DATA LEDE:

* UK Consumer Confidence survey came in at -17, vs -18 forecast. Consumer confidence on the main part is improving in UK, mostly because consumers are coming to expect rate cuts by BOE. We see below though that retail sales came weak.¬†

* CLOTHING, SPORTS, GAMES and TOY STORES and FURNITURE STORES did badly.

* Also, importantly, Michigan Consumer Sentiment numbers, which will include 5 year and 1 year inflation expectations.
* Inflation expectations expected to tick higher to one of the highest readings in last year at 3.5% for 1 year.¬†
* An upside surprise here will not be good and will send dollar higher.¬†

"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ANALYSIS:

Overall US Market:

* SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume.¬†
* Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish.¬†
* Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher.¬†
* So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA.¬†
* Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX.¬†
* MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday.¬†
* VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now.

On FX & metals:

* As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10.
* On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet.

Key stocks for focus:

* **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.**
* **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.**



DATA LEDE:

* UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad.¬†
* But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up.¬†
* Core CPI came 3.9% vs 3.6% expected. Only down slightly from 4.2%
* And if we look at Services in particular, we see Services inflation at 5.9%, much hotter than the 5.4% expected and more or less sticky to last month.
* BOE have been more dovish/neutral recently
* This increases risk of moving more hawkish again.¬†
* Now traders see just 38bps of rate cuts in 2024 after the data, much less than before.¬†
* RBNZ hawkish pause.¬†
* FOMC minutes later.¬†



MARKETS:

* SPX: Flat at 5317. Bounced off high of 5325 again, same as last couple of days.¬† Market will likely remain flat ahead of NVDA earnings and FOMC. WAS A RECORD CLOSE YDAY
* NDX: At record highs. 18,730. 1.5% away from 19k, so can be in view if nVDA earnings come good
* Dow: Flat just under 40k
* GER40: Slightly lower this morning, all just normal profit taking and hedging at these highs, positioning remains bullish.¬†
* HKG50: Flat at 19,202 today, absolutely flat
* OIL: slightly lwoer again. Mostly flat around 78. Was rejected at 80 WTI
* Gold slightly lower today, at 2413. Support still 2400.¬†



FX:

* USD moving slightly higher again, paring some of the post CPI losses.¬† With this, USDJPY continues higher, as yen remains weak after failed intervention. Failed to break 152, hence moving higher.¬†
* EURUSD stuck just under 1.285, bullish positioning. ¬†
* GBPUSD at 1.272. Target looks like 1.28 especially given CPI hot.¬†

"Which one produce more retail trader Millionaires ? Stock or forex ?Hi everyone, I first started my trading journey with forex in 2014 . I thought that would be rich quick thanks to exponential interest but ended up losing for 4 years ! üò≠ 

Then I got rid of my mindset to get rich fast and totally opened my mind to new stuff ! I read a lot of success stories about stock investing and trading! I studied countless of hours millionaire maker stock like Tesla , Microsoft, Nvidia and apple just to name a few! I read many books on stock market too . Then I understood that there  more chance to be successful in stock trading and investing than the famous day trading! I developed a breakout strategy to buy momentum stock when they make new high on weekly chart. It's a momentum sign when the market rise . I will do a post about my strategy soon . I am profitable now!

After all , it's logical because the 2 only factors that are proven to drive a stock price up in the long term are its sales growth and its profits growth! Add a breakout system to it can make the strategy powerful.

I saw some outstanding success stories on the stock markets with traders who turned a couple of  thousands of dollars into millions. 

I exclude crypto because it's pure gambling! I also exclude hedge funds because they are not retail investors and traders like us !

Here are some stock trading and investing outstanding success stories!

Kristian Qullamaggie: turned 9k into $100 million
Jason Debolt : turned 30k to 12 million (Tesla)
Dan zanger :turned 10k into 42 million 
Cis : turned 30 into 300 million 
BNF : turned 13k into 150 million
Tim Sykes : turned 5k into many millions 
Ross Cameron: turned 583 into 11 million 
Keith Gill : turned 50k into 50 million 
Chris Camillo : turned 20 k into 40 million 

These are just some of the countless of incredible success stories from swing trading stocks ! 

I also noted that there are  also thousands of ordinary investors that started from nothing and built a huge wealth for themselves because they are a good stock picker ! Among them some are even billionaires. There's Stewart Horesjsi who became a retail investor billionaire , specially with his bet on Berkshire Hathaway. There is also Herbert Wertheim who is worth $5,3 billion. He made strategic bets on Apple and Microsoft ! These people are not traders ,they are long term investors ! It's to show you the power of the stock market to build wealth for an ordinary investor when he play it right! 

But when I do online research about a retail trader who made millions thanks to forex ,there don't seem to be a lot of positive results! It's weird because there are a lot of gurus that said that they are rich because of forex trading! I know that many are pure fraud!


Tell me if am wrong and if you know some retail traders who made it big in forex ! 

Thanks for your answers and be respectful! üôè",05-19-2024
"These are the stocks on my watchlist (5/15)**These are the stocks on my watchlist (5/15)**

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

This is a daily watchlist for trading.

I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you‚Äôre on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.

Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on \_\_\_\_\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question\~.\~

Meme stocks are the most interesting thing I‚Äôm watching today.

**GME/AMC/BB/meme stocks- All are worth watching today. Looking for places to both long and short.**

"I'm a professional trader and this is my entire premarket report, including earnings summaries, positioning analysis and more. 09/05**Analysis:**

* Will keep it brief here. 
* We continue to see choppiness under SPX 5200 and in and around QQQ 440. 
* This is because prior to OPEX for May, it looks like there‚Äôs not much OTM Call delta to push us meaningfully higher. As such, market makers are keeping us hedged and pinned around these key levels. That includes 39k on Dow. 
* Overall sentiment is bullish. Look at these positioning charts for SPX and NDX and you can see how much call delta there is. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZgiBjyf](https://imgur.com/a/ZgiBjyf) 
* VIX is being suppressed and traders are short on volatility which is supporting the market higher. 
* HY Default Swaps are tight and signal that traders are not particularly worried. 
* There are, as of right now, not too many headwinds right now that traders are seeing. 
* As such, until opex expect choppiness near these levels. With traders selling vol, if there is any intraday dips it likely won‚Äôt last long. 
* Goldman Sachs Volatility panic index also tanking, reversing almost all the gains from the recent bump with geopolitical unrest.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket, including positioning analysis on EURUSD, GOLD, SPX and QQQANALYSIS:

* EURUSD resistance at 1.08. positioning overall is still bullish.
* Probably see it chop around 1.08 and 1.075.
* Positioning against dollar is increasing, as traders unwind some of their shorts on CHF, EUR, JPY etc, as they expect USD to fall on more dovish monetary policy.
* GOLD looks like we are seeing more accumulation and chop before a possible break higher. Probably see similar in Silver too, as IV not increasing OTM on calls, so traders not looking for a breakout just yet but positioning still recovering.
* Today, Skew on QQQ and SPX are relatively flat. 440 is key wall that QQQ will be trying to get on top of.
* VIX is at 13.5, but not seeing much puts open up OTM which tells us it probably doesnt yet crush much lower.
* As such we probably see a choppy day.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including positioning analysis. 06.05ANALYSIS:

* We are trading at or near the 50SMA on both QQQ and SPX.
* We see that with the technicals here:
* Here is SPX:
* [https://imgur.com/a/byLBGna](https://imgur.com/a/byLBGna)
* Here is Nasdaq:
* [https://imgur.com/a/EwT4qXb](https://imgur.com/a/EwT4qXb)
* We saw Nasdaq actually reversed off of the 50 day Moving average.
* Now, these technical are something we want to watch, but aren‚Äôt everything. I read a number of people talking about them on CNBC and even on twitter. Are they important? Kind of. Does it mean we head lower? Not necessarily.
* Why are they kind of important? For the simple fact that other people watch them. Hedge funds are actually not as sophisticated with their technical analysis as you might think, and often they watch the 50 day moving average. Above it, is bullish, below it is bearish in their mind.
* As such, we can see them try to remove positioning if 50D SMA doesn‚Äôt break in first few days of this week.
* However, does it mean we head lower? No, not really. It can easily break through, and QQQ positioning looks strong overall, so I suggest that although we can get some short term consolidation/profit taking under the 50d SMA, it will likely break soon.
* Traders are actually increasing bullish sentiment in the market right now. Call delta is increasing and skew is pointing higher.
* For both QQQ and SPY, skew is pointihg higher than spot price which means traders are betting market goes higher from here.
* VIX is trading under 14. It means market makers are increasing liquidity. It means fear is limited. Dollar is coming down again after dovish Powell, and bonds should fall again soon. IWM could out perform, as it opened above the 50d Moving average on Friday, and managed to hold above it.
* IWM is interest rate sensitive, so as the jobs numbers came lower, which increases chance of rate cuts, we can see it push higher towards 205.
* VIX/ OVerall market fear:
* ITRX XOVER credit default swaps head lower. This is another indicator that tells us about fear and risk in the market. Conclusion, traders not really very worried. This tends to have correlation to VIX, so is supportive of VIX heading lower.
* This should support equity index higher.
* OIL:
* Vol skew on Oil still points towards potential bounce. News of Gaza ceasefire collapse a humanitarian disaster but good for oil. Saudi extend production cuts too which is bullish. Signs of possible bounce up here, as traders unwind puts.
* GOLD:
* GOLD: Skew also points higher now. Traders are unwinding puts as hopes of interest rate cuts rise again after NFP data on Friday. Holding above 2300 is key and supportive for bulls.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC.**ANALYSIS:**

*  Positioning ahead of FOMC is risk off. We see bond yields higher, we see dollar higher, we see institutional money flow out of BTC which is a risk on asset, we see traders buying calls on VIX to hedge for downside. 
* This is why we are seeing markets drop to 5000 level on SPX with the Fed meeting imminent.
* I do think Powell comes hawkish too to be honest. The last meeting, he was happy to dismiss a couple of hot inflation prints as part of the rocky road to 2%, but now we have multiple more hot prints. SO probably he will push back on immediate rate cuts, which can send markets lower.
* Note the data does not support a 2nd wave of inflation though. Oil price positioning is to come lower which will bring headline down. PPI and PPI in europe still suppressed so not a leading indicator of hot inflation to come. 
* What we see after FOMC? What will the market do? Well, simply put, its positioned to go down then piush up again, but will that happen? Who knows at this point, because no one knows what Powell will say. We have to see basically. A bullish Powell, who doesnt say anything overly hawkish can push markets back to 5100 by tomorrow. A hawkish Powell can send down to 4900 today. 
* Oil positioning is looking more bearish. 
* Silver positioning looks ready for a possible bounce back up.

DATA LEDE:

* UK S&P Global manufacturing PMI comes in better than previously reported at 49.1 vs 48.7.

**Longer-term watches:** NVDA/SMCI, SNOW (long for small position), BA, ULTA, TSLA, META",04-29-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including analysis of USDJPY after intervention and TSLA positioning**ANALYSIS:**

* Let‚Äôs look at and analyse the main things happening in premarket first of all. 
* Firstly, the Yen intervention, which Japan‚Äôs Kanda hasn‚Äôt confirmed but reports are out from DJ that thats what happened this morning. 
* We saw yen weaken to 160 vs the USD. This was touted by JPM as the intervention point that BOJ were looking at, although their commentary last week was all very much vague. 
* When we saw 160 hit, we saw a big drop in USDJPY, as yen squeezed higher. 
* The price action was more extreme because Japan has a national holiday today, hence trading volumes were thin. 
* WE saw it drop from 160 to 154.5
* It found support from the technicals at the 20 day Moving average, as we see below:
* We saw recovery above the 155 level. 155 is one of the key gamma levels, where there is a lot of put support there. The bigger key gamma level, below this is 152. There is a hell of a lot of put support at 152. If the BOJ wants the yen to meaningfully improve vs the USD, it needs to get USDJPY below 152. Thats when we can go meaningfully lower. Above there, and we expect it to find support from these gamma levels and move higher, as we saw it do from 155. 
* Skew actually points higher in USDJPY now. This tells us that traders are not really expecting much more meaningful intervention right now. We can see USDJPY move higher again soon. Probably won‚Äôt be as effective as BOJ hoped. 
* Now the other key news from premarket, is TESLA, who have now received the regulatory approval for FULL self driving in China, rather than the limited product they had on offer already. 
* Tesla is pumping in premarket. 
* If we look at the gamma levels, we see 200 as having a lot of open interest. As such, we can see it as a magnet for price action moving forward. 
* FTSE pushed higher to 8200, but we see skew lowering. This tells us traders are hedging for price action to mveo lower now. The move is likely close to done for now, except if the Fed support move higher. We expect that because OTM delta isnt really showing much call delta so traders aren‚Äôt betting FTSE goes much higher. 
* HKG50 breakout from downtrend since 2023 continues, hitting 18k level today. 18k is v big gamma level, hence why we saw price action reverse from here. 
* In SPX, we see traders unwind some of their hedges as they bet that geopolitical pressures are mostly behind us. We see that too, as oil skew points lower which suggests traders expect oil to move down soon. 
* Finally, busy week ahead. 
* This week ahead, we have FOMC decision on Wednesday, as well as jobs numbers throughout the week, which will give us some insight into the labour market. 
* Put on top of that all the following earnings reports, and we are set for a volatile week of trading. 

DATA LEDE:

* Spain inflation rate:
* 3.3% YOY vs 3.4% expected, previous reading was 3.2%
* SO ticked up from last month, but not as much as expected.

* Nasdaq: up 0.3% in premarket, trading at 17,780. 17,850 is a resistance, then The next big resistance will be the 18k level. 
* Dow Jones: Flat in premarket, trading at 38,300. 
* HKG50 up 1% again in premarket. Now at 17,750. Touched 18k then came down from there. 18k is now the strong resistance. 
* UK100 higher to 8200, pared slightly to 8180. Still up 0.4% today. 
* GER40: flat around 18,140.
* Oil: Flat at 83.65. Maintaining the uptrend drawn since December 2023. 
* GOld: Flat above 2300. 
* VIX: Vix flat at 15.22. last week closed perfectly at the put support of 15. Was a big VIX crush last week. Opened today at 15.22. 

FX:

* USDJPY closed Friday at 158.3.
* In early Monday trading, it moved up to 160. This was a key level where traders were hedging for intervention.
* It seemed as though we did get that fX intervention hence the big decline.
* This decline was right down to 154.5
* This is where the 20 day Moving average was and so it found support there.
* Also a key gamma level at 155. 
* It moved below this level, before recovering above again. 
* Note: its a national holiday in Japan, hence why more exaggerated trading on thin volumes. 
* Despite this no official comment from BOJ that they have intervened, although that is the clear assumption. 
* So Yen squeezed higher after hitting 160 vs USD
* All other currencies quite flat compared.
* GBPUSD up 0.3% to 1.253EURUSD same trend, up 0.2% after selling off on Friday. Now at 1.071. On Friday, it retested 1.07 before pushing higher.

"Buying right at market open?Complete beginner here who is learning to trade by paper trading. I have been following the quarterly earnings report for Tesla. They released the report with positive news after market close yesterday. I planned on paper trading this morning with the positive news, however right as the market opens at 9:30 the stock takes an immediate jump and I miss the quick gains. Is there a way to buy pre-market opening or place an order on a timer to buy right at market opening so not to miss this jump? I am using trading view. Probably a stupid question but I am brand new.

"$ALLG Allego - likely to be ideal for day-traders[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-allego-partner-electrify-european-143000121.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-allego-partner-electrify-european-143000121.html)

* Recent price action
   * Has been stable around one, on very low volume (unlikely to drop much before earnings) 
   * Has been running into previous earning calls (which got delayed)  on high volume, but got delayed due to a form lacking.  I assume as soon as earnings are announced/form filed, this will once again become a roller-coaster. 

==============================================================

* **The market**
   * **Shell** [Energy](https://www.the-sun.com/topic/energy/)**, an energy force to be reckoned with in the United States, has one of the largest** [gas](https://www.the-sun.com/topic/gas/) **station footprints in the nation.To meet the growing need for public EV charging stations, however, Yahoo! Finance** **reported** **the company's announcement to shut down 1,000 gas pumps and replace them with public EV charging hubs.""We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs,"" read the company's 2024 Energy Transition Strategy.**
      * This news tells us, what Shell (and thus other market players) are thinking, and of course that demand globally will be rising.
* **Company overview:**
   * Allego NV (based in The Netherlands) provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers, ranging from slow charging to ultrafast, but their focus is fast charging (50 - 125 KW) on parking lots. They operate 34.000+ charging points throughout Europe.
* **The stock**
   * is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV-related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell-off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It's a European company and the European market is totally different.
* **Sales**
   * In Europe EV sales are still growing, helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one, big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win.
* The company
   * started in The Netherlands, which has been one of the front-runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries, such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs, but are catching up rapidly (again: helped by legislation). In these countries there's a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time, so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There's not a lot of competition in Europe: some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand-alone locations next to the major roads (such as FastNed, Ionity or Tesla).
* **Financially**
   * Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2% to ‚Ç¨28.6 million, compared to ‚Ç¨22.3 million in the prior year period.
   * Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0% to ‚Ç¨22.0 million, compared to ‚Ç¨14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
   * Gross profit increased to ‚Ç¨5.4 million compared to ‚Ç¨(4.6) million in the prior-year-period; gross margin during the quarter was 18.9%.
   * Third quarter 2023 net loss was ‚Ç¨(43.1) million, compared to ‚Ç¨(22.1) million in the prior-year period; Operational EBITDA was ‚Ç¨2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior-year period loss of ‚Ç¨(3.1) million.
   * Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group, the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region, with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024, and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025.
   * In October, Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network.

So i bought the second it broke the range upward (even tho i saw the down trend on 1h candles and determined that it was most likely gonna be a bearish open) and it quikly went down to my stop. Did i rush it and bought too soon? Or was the biggest mistake not listening to myself when i saw a down trend and buying anyways? Because even if i shorted when it broke downward i would have been stopped anyways right? Because the wick of the third candle when up quite a bit.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC meeting today.**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday, we saw an early dip in the equity markets as SPX touched 5123, and QQQ touched 433.
* However, as mentioned in the premarket report and continually mentioned in my commentaries, traders remain incredibly short volatility. 
* AS such, that created the usual vix crush as we see here, with VIX dropping below 13.
* [https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf](https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf) 
* This fuelled market makers to add liquidity, which led to the usual intraday recovery back to 5180 and 438.5. 
* Today, we have the FOMC meeting which will be the key focus, as will the updated dot plot which will be released. 
* We are seeing low volume in options ahead of this, as traders are basically waiting for it. 
* On January and February CPI coming in ahead of expectations, and with Shelter and Core inflation remaining very sticky, there is some likely expectation that Powell will be less dovish. 
* I think that‚Äôs probably true, he will be more hawkish, but it appears traders are not expecting him to be outright hawkish as such. 
* Probably more neutral, pointing to the fact that inflation is coming down, and will affirm their intention to continue bringing inflation down. He will probably continue to say that they just need to see more of the same before moving to cutting. More of the usual data dependence commentary, but with hints that cuts will still be on the table. 
* Credit Default swaps don‚Äôt show any signs of major alarm, and continue to head lower. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo](https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo) 
* Traders are hedging into today‚Äôs meeting. Dollar is increasing in premarket. Nonetheless, traders remain very short volatility still. Inflation swaps are still pricing inflation to come down later in the year, even if it appears that it is stuck for now. 
* I think that off the back of this, we do probably see dollar increase, hence why I haven‚Äôt averaged my positions against USD today and averaged with very little size yesterday. Looking at the equity market, we probably see some volatility, and a dip, but vol will probably crush again, so any VIX spike probably won‚Äôt last long, which should again fuel market makers to add liquidity to aid the recovery (not necessarily same day recovery, but short term nonetheless). 
* On next monthly expiry, we have seen 5300 accumulate gex quite a bit recently, so traders are still looking higher, but hedge for some volatility.
* As mentioned previously, we can see traders open puts inr response to a possible hawkish Powell, and then get squeezed again and forced to short cover, as we have seen repeatedly over the course of this rally, and as we saw on Monday.

I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers).

To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: this is a watchlist of stocks that I am looking at for potential day trades. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket after market sold off yesterday**ANALYSIS:**

* We do have a few volatile events today. Firstly the ADP jobs numbers, which are expected to come in hotter than last month, whilst Powell talks in his testimony infant of Congress. 
* I think Powell‚Äôs talk will be important, but probably not the impact some may fear, as if you look historically at when Powell testifies, not as much movement as other speeches by Powell. Only thing I worry about is the fact that inflation ticked higher last month and could tick higher again this month if you look at Euro inflation reports for Feb as a guide. This could make Powel more hawkish than before. Still, Powell is generally v candid with his words so I‚Äôm not sure he will say anything which kills the market, but let‚Äôs see. 
* Regardless, if we look at risk reversal on DXY, we see it widen as traders continue to expect dollar to fall in medium term.
* Traders are mostly long GBPUSD, and very short USDJPY. LEt‚Äôs see. 
* EURUSD they are long as well, but less so. Let‚Äôs see. Moving towards 1.09 which is trader target but may see rejection there. 
* Regarding price movement yesterday, we saw a squeeze as traders very short volatility, which was triggered by bad news around TESla and AAPl. 
* This moved VIX much higher to 15, which led to QQQ sell off.
* Was. Bigger sell off than I anticipated, but signs of a major pullback still not there.
* Traders still very short vol, and we saw them sell it off towards end of the day, and today, VIX is lwoer at 14. 
* Yesterday was likely a buying opportunity rather than a major negative event. 
* We can get volatility from JOLTS today, they tend to be volatile for the market, but still no major signs of pullback. 
* Institutional money flow on SPY not pulling back one bit. THeyre still long. 
* On oil we can expect a bit more sideways movement below 80, as volatility skew quite flat, but I think fundamentals support move back to 80 on WTI as producers look to extend cuts to supply.

DATA LEDE:

* South Korea Inflation rate comes hot, at 3.1% vs 2.9% expected. Above previous reading of 2.8%
* MOM was hot 0.5% vs 0.4% expected
* Aus GDP (Q4) - Comes stronger than expected, at 1.5% YOY growth rate, vs 1.4% expected. Previous reading was 2.1%
* So it slowed vs last month, but beat expectations. 
* GERMAN exports and imports both beat expectation
* Exports MOM came 6.3% Up, vs expectations of 1.5% increase
* Imports were 3.6% up, vs expectations of 1.8% increase
* This points to improving domestic demand and international demand, although is one data point. 
* Eurozone Retail Sales (Jan)
* Retail sales were down 1% YOY, better than expectations of a -1.3% decline.
* MOM retail sales were more or less in line.
* So still declining YOY. This has been the case for more than a year. Not great, but in line with expectations. 
* ADP Employment Chnge (Feb) - Expected to have grown to 150k jobs placed according to official consensus. 
* POWELL TESTIMONY
* JOLTS (Jan) - has been a volatile one for market reaction for intraday trading, so look out for this one.

FX:

"Trading from phone with limitsTrying to develop a strategy to get back into trading, my job changed and I have less available time on my hands and even less at a computer. Has a one developed a reliable strategy for mobile trading? Realistically I can chart up on Wednesday and Thursday, maybe Friday mornings. Used to watch price action/volume and trade spy/tesla 0-3dtes and exercise tight stops and going with the trend, not looking for break outs or reversals or yolos but scalping in 2-15 minutes adjusting my stop loss  as trades moved in my favor or against me and getting out quick. 

Is there any easy indicators/platforms to use on my phone besides Webull/robinhood?
What time frames should I utilize?
Should i look at futures where I might be able to trade in the late afternoon? 
Or should I just buy and hold shares until I can sell covered options on them?

Is there anyway Robinhood is off or am I off?",02-24-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21**ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google‚Äôs where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

‚Äî‚Äî

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. 
* Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. 
* We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. 
* Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023. 
* Japan Balance of Trade Numbers:
* Overall balance of trade was less negative than expected. 
* Exports grew more than expected up 12% YOY, ahead of expectations of 9.5%
* Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected.
* This means more exports and less imports, points to greater demand for JPY. Would expect JPY to rise on this. But JPY down on Japanese gov downgrades and business survey weakness. 
* Australia Wage Price index:FASTEST PACE OF RISE In 15 YEARS. 
* YOY comes 4.2% vs 4.1% forecast. Last quarter‚Äôs data revised up to 4.1% from 4%.
* QOQ comes 0.9% vs 0.9% forecast. 
* Hotter than expected wage data points to stickier service inflation and thus, a more hawkish RBA. 
* UK Record budget surplus for January:
* UK Chief secretary says that they still won‚Äôt speculate if tax cuts are affordable or not in the budget. 
* US mortgage demand numbers:
* Mortgage demand takes a hit, interest rates cross back over 7% on reduced rate cut expectations pushing up bond yields. 
* EU Consumer Confidence NUmbers:
* Later we have FOMC minutes - likely reveals more of what we know, continue to explain that we need to see more of the same data to be confident of cuts. Slight hawkish tone probably. 
* FED SPEAKERS: BOSTIC speaks, as does Bowman. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX - yesterday, found support around 4955, before recovering back to 4977. Before Europe opened, was trading at 4972, dropped slightly on European open as FTSE100 sold off. 
* Nasdaq: Slightly lags SPX and DJI. This is due to the big sell off in PANW. Low of day yesterday was 17,400, before recovery to 17,550. Lower in premarket,. 
* DJI - Trading at around 38,500 in premarket, slightly down, at the low of the day from yesterday. 
* HKG market higher today on cutting of loan prime rate. Was up almost 4%, as high as 16,800, before paring some gain to 16,460. 
* China meanwhile is up 2% to 11,890. Key level here will be the 12k level, which it was rejected off of. 
* GER40: low of yday was 17,020. Trading quite flat. Today got a bit of a boost at open and is up 0.42% to 17062. This comes as we are seeing higher open interest on 17.5k

"My strategy is too simple and too good to be true when automated.Hello, my strategy is very simple. It's about price action and riding with the trend.

Although I have always been struggling with the emotions and psychological aspect of trading (waiting for a setup is always the hardest part), it never failed me to give good results when I'm manual trading.

So just yesterday I tried prompting ChatGPT to code my strategy - which is a very simple strategy utilizing some default indicators from TradingView. Honestly, I'm not really surprise of the results because when I manual trade, it really works everytime.

Here are the results for the different instruments and different timeframes:

&#x200B;

All trades started from 2023 - current.

Timeframes: 1m - 5m - 30m - 1H

STOCKS: TESLA - [https://imgur.com/a/rZ1lvZT](https://imgur.com/a/rZ1lvZT)

FUNDS: SPY - [https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe](https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe)

FOREX: EURUSD - [https://imgur.com/a/eawzMNg](https://imgur.com/a/eawzMNg)

CRYPTRO: BTCUSDT - [https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe](https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe)

INDEX: SPX - [https://imgur.com/a/j7B2Nsi](https://imgur.com/a/j7B2Nsi)

&#x200B;

The strategy does not use SL/TP. It exits a trade if an opposite signal is generated, I think it's what caused the drawdowns. I'm still analyzing how I can utilize SL for this strategy. Of course I use SL/TP on manual trading. In this 'automated version' I think it's profitable because there's no emotions/psychology involved at all.

I developed this strategy on XAUUSD - 1m mainly for scalping, refined and reviewed it every weekend. Implemented it on higher TF and it works.

Now, I know it's not 100% reliable and I'm asking for your suggestions how to make sure the results are reliable. I also don't have access to deep back testing yet. Do you also know a way to convert this pinescript code to MQL5? or make an expert advisor out of it? Thank you!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I manual trade with it. This is my strategy, just automated. I'm just taking a break from trading because of my emotions and psychology. I wanted to know what will be my strategy's results if there's no emotions involved lol.

"You need to give stocks room to breathe.Day trading is a lot more difficult these days. 

I want to share my tesla trade this morning. 

https://imgur.com/a/94xgnrq

Tesla was weaker than the market down 2.5% gapping down, and fits my short gap down strategy. I enter short at 185 break, and I'm rewarded 1.4 Points. I take some profit at 1 point mark, and but then look what happens a giant green candle forming brand new highs instantly...

Why did this happen? to be honest it's impossible to truly tell, but a lot of people put their stops at the highs, that green candle would have stopped out many many short traders instantly.  I held what was left of my position, and watched it dwindle back down to new lows. 

This is why day trading is the worlds most failed profession, these things happen for absolutely no reason other than pure algo fuckery. 

While reading the tape I saw so many people going long on that 1 candle, not knowing it was a bull trap, and saw the same tape selling it back down. 

Stocks need room to breathe, they do so much nasty moves like this just to scare retail traders. 

Less Size + More room = better profits.",02-02-2024
"Does anyone day trade tsll/tslsor trade tesla directly? I am seeing tsll or tsls have big bid/ask ratio differences such as a 5 cent difference would translate to an immediate loss 0f almost 100$ if you buy 20k worth of shares. 

Are these instruments worth it, or should i just avoid them and directly trade tesla stock?

P:S I am not considering options",01-31-2024
"Whats wrong with not selling at a loss if you have a good stockSo, since i started trading stocks, mostly blue chips such as tsla, amd, tqqq etc. I have been not honoring my stop losses, because my theory is even if my current thesis turned out to be wrong,  eventually my underlying will recover at some point, if not today than maybe tomorrow. So far this has not caused me any loss, as i just hold out until it recovers. The only problem is that i might have to hold it overnight, or a day or two, so it ends up becoming a swing trade.

With options i do understand you have to sell out immediately if your thesis doesnt play out because of expiration, and theta decay etc. But whats wrong if i buy 30k worth of tesla, and when i was hoping for it to go up, it instead goes down. It will eventually recover right? What is wrong with this strategy?

Even today i bought tqqq when rsi was low and price was below all indicators. I was waiting for recovery after buying but it didnt happen and it has been chopping and even down a little since i bought it 45 mins ago. But eventually it will recover, and then i can sell it at a profit ",01-30-2024
Can someone help me understand this?I‚Äôm fairly new to trading and learned quite a bit from this sub and YouTube. But I was watching a stream of trader from last year and they were swing trading Tesla on top of the day trades they were doing. But I don‚Äôt understand the price of Tesla. From what I gathered the highest Tesla has ever gone was around $409. So why does it show it so high? Something I‚Äôm missing? Thanks!,01-30-2024

I will be shorting most pumps. few weeks out on technicals and averaging down.

1x Tesla is currently a horrendous value play in the short term to medium term due to speculative long term growth catalysts.

2. Tesla was expected to grow 50% over year next year. 

3x Cars overpriced as shit compared to increasingly similar market counterparts. Hyundai Ioniq and Ford get similar milage

4x) Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected 15% growth in revenue. Possible

5x) Other cars are expected, to grow fast in self driving.

6) Used cars saturating market.

7)Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.

"The Dow‚Äôs Surging2024 has been a wild ride for the markets. We've seen tech stocks taking a hit, while traditional financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are soaring. And then today, the Dow breaks an all-time high, shooting up more than 300 points. Big bank earnings are driving this rally, but something‚Äôs been nagging at me.

While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are basking in the spotlight, Tesla‚Äôs been struggling‚Äîdown 8.1% after rolling out their robotaxi. It‚Äôs got me wondering: Is the market getting too hyped on the banks while brushing off some of the underlying risks?

Sure, JPMorgan beat earnings expectations and raised its annual forecast. Wells Fargo? Another 5.6% gain. But when you zoom out, there‚Äôs still a lot of uncertainty hanging over the economy. The Fed's potential 25-basis-point rate cut in November could be the cushion these banks need, but it‚Äôs not a guaranteed win.

Honestly, I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîam I missing something here? The Dow's on a winning streak, and major banks are leading the charge. But with mixed inflation data and the tech sector‚Äôs rocky performance, should we be more cautious?

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Are the banks really as bulletproof as they seem right now? Or are there risks we‚Äôre not seeing in this rally?",10-11-2024

"Thoughts on nvda### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA‚Äôs investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA‚Äôs market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA‚Äôs manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA‚Äôs market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",06-12-2024

"How do you decide position size based on ticker?I‚Äôve only been trading SP500 & Nasdaq for awhile now but want to start diversifying my trades to multiple stocks/tickers.

But problem is, I don‚Äôt know how to position the size correctly for each ticker. For instance, Tesla is much more volatile than Pfizer, so should I trade with more cash on Pfizer and less on Tesla?

I‚Äôm currently looking at Beta and recalculating how many shares to trade based on the Beta value for each ticker.

Does anyone have a different way to gauge how much size to trade based on ticker?",03-18-2024
"Always factor in beta when trading?Do you guys always factor in beta (to position size correctly) when making trades? 

Backstory:

I have swing trades on Bank of America (BAC), Pfizer (PFE), and Tesla (TSLA) over last 2-weeks. I put the same amount into each trade and won on BAC and PFE, but lost on TSLA. Since the TSLA trade lost a lot more (higher beta), I am still net negative even though I have 2 out of 3 win rate over the last 2-weeks",03-16-2024

"09/02 Premarket Report - Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket as SPX breaks 5k.**ANALYSIS:**

* We broke 5000 in premarket, which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. Premarket trading isn‚Äôt the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. So when the market opens, we will want to see SPX consolidate above the 5000 level. It will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. 
* We can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly OPex. 
* We can see that here: 
* [https://imgur.com/a/yhA4dcp](https://imgur.com/a/yhA4dcp) 
* And with a different visualisation here: 
* [https://imgur.com/a/k49BUH6](https://imgur.com/a/k49BUH6) 
* We have shown before that the money flows into SPX reached new highs. Here is a different visualisation of this, from Nomura, which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/gYRSZ6t](https://imgur.com/a/gYRSZ6t) 
* Look at the Skew on the Mag 7. 
* Very very strong, not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys.
* [https://imgur.com/a/rWu04dp](https://imgur.com/a/rWu04dp) 
* Money flows in SPX remain strong , we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in QQQ. 
* The gamma is very very high again today, which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised, although we will have the CPI revisions released, which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. Note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and Yields rising. If we do get that kind of move higher, we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into CPI print next week.
* See the institutional research section to read about Morgan Stnaley‚Äôs prediction for the CPI next week. 
* IWM lastly, Trading above a key gamma level, skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. Traders expect bond yields to fall and IWM to break higher. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/jKEvfek](https://imgur.com/a/jKEvfek) 
* Yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market, but I do want to share with you an alternative analysis from Goldman Sachs here. 
* Goldman note that ‚Äúwe are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective Mag 6 names. This is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era (looking back 3 years). WE note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence, the 2-4 week forward return is negative‚Äù.
* We can see that in this graph below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/3pvrKge](https://imgur.com/a/3pvrKge) 

**GAMMA LEVELS TO WATCH: - plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them.**

* SPX trading at 5013
* These are the key gamma levels:
* Gamma level at 5025
* My quant says max of the day expected to be 5031
* 5000 remains tech all resistance 
* Gamma level at 4975 below that,
* My quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. That marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. 
* QQQ:
* Call resistance remains at 440
* Myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95
* Gamma level at 436 too.
* 435 is where the 0dte Call resistance is
* Below spot, key gamma level is at 430. 
* Below this, my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. That‚Äôd mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* US CPI Revisions - markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. 
* This comes ahead of CPI next week. 
* Last time, the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn‚Äôt so great, which made yields jump and the dollar jump. 
* Fed‚Äôs Logan speaks later though

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
 **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH:**

* With CPI next week, let‚Äôs take a look at Morgan Stanley‚Äôs CPI prediction:
* [https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC](https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC) 
* They expect CPI decelerated to 0.26% MOM in January, below consensus of 0.3%
* Said they think core services was sideways and good decelerated. Energy prices will drop headline to 0.14%
* Bank of America‚Äôs put out mapper saying that Stock Rally close to triggering Sell Signal. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX: breaks above 5k in premarket. Closed yesterday at 4998 after a flat trading day

* JAPAN‚Äôs Nikkei is at 34 year highs. Broke 37k for first time in 34 years. This comes as Ueda said that easy monetary conditions will persist even if BOJ scraps negative interest rate policy. 
* Oil: Flat today, pushed up strongly yesterday by over 3%. Big bounce of 6.4% since lows. Oil been moving higher as Israel rejects the ceasefire offer. 
* GOLD: trading flat today as dollar is totally flat. 

**FOREX:**

* Without much data releases, seeing quite flat FX movement on the whole. 
* USDJPY dipped temporarily in morning as reports came out that Ueda echoes the same (dovish) sentiment as shared by Uchida yesterday. Ueda said that easy monetary conditions will persist even if BOJ scraps negative interest rate policy. 
* Australian Dollar higher following comments from RBA‚Äôs Bullock. It was a mixed talk, but he did say ‚Äúboard doesnt rule out or rule in more hikes‚Äù. Markets pushed out rate hike expectations on these comments.   
 Dollar flat, ahead of CPI revisions.

"Why is the buy and sell value on trading 212 not reflective of the price of 1 share?This may be a stupid question, but I am very new to this. On trading 212, if I look at Tesla for example. It says the buy price is $186.65 however if I choose to buy just 1 single share, it is valued at 29.37. Could somebody explain what I am not understanding? 

Thanks in advance!",01-31-2024
"I'm a professional news driven trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket 25/01 including analysis of Tesla and more.To support more analysis like this, please join r/Tradingedge as well as r/Trading. 

**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday we hit 4900 like a brick wall and got rejected, a lot of algorithmic selling from that point brought us lower. 
* Looking at today vs yesterday, we can see that the call resistance still sits at 4900, it hasn‚Äôt rolled up yet to 4950 or above. We want to see the roll up of call resistance for us to be more bullish. 
* In fact, after 4900 got rejected yesterday, we can see that traders bought a fair bit of Puts 0DTE. On February expiration, we can see calls on 5000 and 4950 got sold, and puts got bought. So positioning bit worse, but still bullish. Money flows are strong. 
* If we look 0dte we can see big walls at 4880 as 0dte call resitance and 4845 as 0dte put resistance. These will act as sticky strikes, but obviously they are just 0dte so they can be broken by strong volume from GDP data. 
* QQQ positioning more or less as it was. Call resistance still at 430, which will act as a wall. 
* IWM we are seeing some selling of calls, as bond yields push higher. 
* Note that positioning today will be subject to the GDP print. A big surprise in either direction will clearly impact the market, as it will impact bond yields, dollar, and the chance of rate cuts. 
* We showed yesterday that the probability of March rate cuts has been directly driving dollar price action, and in turn the equity market. 
* We can see from the chart below that the reduction in rate cuts being priced was what directly correlated to the equity sell off.

* Vix is pretty much sleeping at this point, so this is a good thing to watch as the number of rate cuts being priced and equity markets are moving inversely.   

* Furthermore, Tesla will weigh on Nasdaq a bit today. The report wasn‚Äôt great. Pointing to lower volume is not what investors want to be hearing, but that is mostly because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle, or so they say. 
* I do think that we have to remember that the stock was trading at 260 at the start of the year. It‚Äôs already down 27% on that. I do think Tesla goes lower but I am not as pessimistic as other people on Reddit and social media.   

* A quick look at China, because China announced more supportive measures, this time for the property sector. 
* Call volumes on China are flying, after the announcement of stimulus measures this week. We can see that below.

* I did look at the option profile for FXI, and saw a fair bit of selling of puts at 21. Positioning is looking much better. 
* Mainland investors aren‚Äôt chasing this rally though, but area actually selling it. Whilst we can see more of a squeeze here, and I am long China so I want to see that, I do think we need to see mainland investor sentiment shift before we see sustainable rally forwards.
* Along with the improved positioning on China, we can see AUD risk reversal points up.  
 Traders fully expecting 0.67 right now, as stimulus in china helps Australian trade. 

**DATA LEDE**

* IFO Report for Germany:
* Business climate was 85.2, lowest reading in a year and missed expectations.
* IFO expectations also came in light, and at the lowest level in over a year. 
* We can see the weakness visualised here:

* This report reiterates the growing weakness in Germany.   
 
* ECB Interest Rate decision. Expect the ECB to walk back some of thier dovishness. This hawkishness could push EUR higher.  

* Jobless claims and US GDP growth 
* Expectation for GDP is fora moderation to the more usual 2% vs last quarter‚Äôs anomalous 4.9% 
* Also watch the durable goods orders, expected to be 1.1%.

"AAPL, TSLA, NVDA: What positioning data tells us to expect for price action in Short term.**AAPL:**

**Look at the skew below:**

[https://imgur.com/a/7Fszu74](https://imgur.com/a/7Fszu74)

Despite the bounce in equity prices, skew never really pointed higher. Sentiment remains subdued around AAPL. Negative analyst downgrades continued last week, putting pressure from week before.

Main option volume is buying OTM put options. Traders expect price to fall.

Gamma wall at 180. Call resistance at 200. Other gamma level at 190. Likely rngebound in 180 to 190.

**TSLA:**

We can see that the break of 220 has sent skew lower. 220 was a key level. next key level down is 200 which is the put support. 210 also a big strike and will be in play.

[https://imgur.com/a/q5h18n5](https://imgur.com/a/q5h18n5)

Call resistance moved down from 250 to 233.33 which is not bullish.

Positioning got worse on Tesla, but notice the orange line> money flows remain bullish. Hedge funds din't sell, still holding their positions long. I guess they expect recovery in medium term.

Main options im seeing are puts on 210. Fully expect 210 to hit maybe even 200.

200 game wall is massive though and can expect a bounce from there.

&#x200B;

**NVDA**:

Look at the skew below:

[https://imgur.com/a/aDg8NFJ](https://imgur.com/a/aDg8NFJ)

Skew index moving lower on both weekly and monthly. IV in OTM call options decreasing, which is causing volatility.

People re selling calls, will likely pullback.

Main calls being sold are 560.

Call resistance remains at 550, strong gamma level at 500, which it cn bounce from. below that, is 450 put support.

"FSD needs minimal lane change option I commute 80 miles a day and just need to go straight really. Before I wouldn't even put a destination because the tesla mapping has a lot of incorrect mapping causing you to exit out the carpool lane or take an unnecessary exit all together.
Additionally, here on the 15 north and south carpool lane in San Diego, we have a moving medium that adds an extra lane going south in the morning (3 lanes south and 1 north) and changes it back to 2 north and 2 south in the afternoon.

I have a Tesla Model S Plaid 2024 (and love it) but the last couple of days, the temperature have dropped to just below freezing.

To night, the same happened again and I tried to manual start the charging - due to the temperature, the car started to heat the battery to improve charging and it slowly started ramping up the charge speed, but then stopped after just a minute or two. I tried quite a few times with the exact same result. I then tried to limit the amperes to just 6A and started charging - this time it went better and it charged for perhaps 5 minutes (while heating the battery) - then I increased the amperes to 16A, and it immediately stopped charging.

Next time I tried again with on 6A and the heating turned on - then I slowly increased to 7A, 8A etc and over 10-15 min to 16A - not it charges with 16A and is approaching the charge limit (I only charge to 70% as I have short day to day commute).

"Road Rage Dashcam RecordingHi Everyone,

This afternoon, I experienced a frightening road rage incident on my drive home. A driver began tailgating me, despite my staying out of the passing lane and adhering to reasonable speeds (15 mph over speed limit). When he eventually passed me, he yelled and made offensive gestures. I assumed he‚Äôd move on, but instead, he slowed down and continued to tailgate me, no matter which lane I switched to.

The driver was following me and I was worried he might have a weapon. I considered calling 911 or taking an exit to find the nearest police station but ultimately decided against exiting for safety concerns. Fortunately, I drive the Performance Model and was able to distance myself after about 10 minutes of evasive maneuvers. In hindsight, I regret not calling 911, though other drivers may have reported his behavior as it was very apparent what he was doing.

**My question is:** Is it possible to record longer events on the dash cam? I‚Äôm new to Tesla and couldn‚Äôt find guidance in the manual. This was a stressful experience, and while I hope it won‚Äôt happen again, I‚Äôd like to be better prepared.

Thank you for your help.",11-21-2024

This feature requires vehicle update 2024.38+ and Tesla app update 4.38+.‚Äú

App is newest built on iOS. 

My M3 (09/21) does not turn on the AC due to a lack of connectivity, while frunk and unlocking works in the same spot. 

I just moved to a building with no internet connection in the underground parking. 

Anyone knows whether I got it wrong?",11-20-2024
"Charging while raining Hey y‚Äôall!

"Tesla Model S Plaid seat height (from ground to lowest setting) Hey

I have test driven the MS Plaid today and was a bit disappointed that it didn‚Äôt feel that sporty at all (except for the acceleration ofc). I think one of the reasons for it is that you sit quite high relative to the car compared to a Taycan for example. Therefore my question: Is anyone willing to quickly measure the distance from the ground up to the seat at it lowest setting? Thanks in advance

"Opinions on model 3/Y/X after test drives Over the last month, I‚Äôve test driven several 2024 Tesla Models (3/Y/X). Here are my general thoughts.

*Disclaimer* I currently don‚Äôt own any Tesla products expect a level 2 Tesla wall charger for my house

1) HW4 is awesome especially in its current version (12.5.6.3). Yes it‚Äôs not perfect, but highway is almost perfect. Overall 95% of time, it can function without any intervention. If there‚Äôs something even close to FSD, please let me know because I would love to know and try it out. I would pay a lot of money if Mercedes or BMW is somehow able to buy the licensing rights to FSD in the future. 

2) Model 3 highland (2024 and higher) is vastly superior to previous model 3s. Having test driven the 2024 model X, I would say the new model 3 is almost as comfortable despite not having air suspension. I would venture in a blind test, it would be difficult to tell apart a model x and new model 3 as far as cabin noise and overall ride quality. 

Of note the non performance seats are softer and more comfortable in comparison to the performance bucket seats which I found to be stiffer. And the smaller wheels of the non-performance version make the ride slightly more smoother. Overall I would say the AWD or RWD at 35 or 40k after tax credit is the best small/mid size sedan in the market today and nothing comes close in this price range.

3) I was overall impressed with the 2024 Model Y as far as versatility. I would probably buy the Model Y today if project Juniper was already out. In comparison to the refreshed model 3, the current Y is definitely noisier and slightly harsher ride quality particularly in higher speed and bumpier roads

4) Model X although is very spacious and airy/roomy, it is overpriced and in serious need of a refresh. Once the Y is refreshed, model X sales will plummet even more. Overall very disappointed in Tesla‚Äôs luxury trims. They really do seem like a legacy model at this point and the focus seems to have purposely shifted towards model 3 and Y overall the last few years. BMW/Mercedes/Volvo is in another league as far as comfort and ride quality. As I said earlier I would pay a pretty penny if true luxury automakers like BMW/Mercedes is able to use Tesla‚Äôs proprietary FSD in the future. ",11-20-2024

"New post with screenshots of 12v issue on 2014 model s2014 model S - dealer said 11 month new 12v died, but electrical seats were still working when I dropped the car off - help?

I took a 400-mile road trip, following Tesla‚Äôs navigation for supercharging stops. The navigation estimated I‚Äôd have 5% battery remaining before reaching the next supercharger. However, about a mile before arriving, my car warned of a critical issue, stating I might lose steering and power. I pulled over and waited four hours for a tow truck to take me 75 miles to the nearest Tesla service center.

When I dropped off the car, the power seats still worked, suggesting the 12V battery wasn‚Äôt completely dead. However, the service advisor said the 12V battery needed replacement because it had been drained due to the high-voltage battery running too low. This confused me, as the 12V battery was replaced just 11 months ago and the seats were still functional. They charged me $500 for a new 12V battery and to charge the high-voltage battery. Additionally, Tesla didn‚Äôt cover 25 miles of the tow, so I paid another $250, bringing the total to $750.

Does this explanation make sense to anyone?

The first two images are the invoice from the issue most recently a week ago and then the third invoice is from December of last year, proving that they replaced the battery less than a year ago   ",11-20-2024

When I connect UMC to the 14-50 outlet, the Tesla symbol doesn't glow amd neither does the car charge. I checked with the property manager and he said that UMC is rated for 32A and the outlet is rated for 60A. He suggested that I call an electrician to get a 32A breaker for the UMC to work.

"Does the fsd add value to your Tesla? I'm considering buying a new model 3 AWD, in Canada there is a deal that if you buy it with fsd you get 0% interest rate (or 1% over 6 years) which will end up saving me about as much money as it costs. But I'm wondering does it actually add any value to the car and do you guys think fsd will remain as expensive as it currently is? 

Thanks for all the advice guys - I was asking because I don't have a down payment, im actually trying to use the 0% interest deal for fsd buyers to transfer a high interest rate purchase I made on a used car and save some money. Right now the fsd is saving me around 15k in interest over 6 years so it's worth adding it just for that but I was hoping it would be worth a little more than a fraction of what I have to pay for it.

"Charging question costWe use Southern california edison and on the d-care rate with tier 1 being .31 for 351kwh and tier 2 being .40kwh for anything over it.

Should i change to TOU instead now that i have a tesla model Y? I want to maximize the electricity costs so its not too much but just want to make sure we dont use too much electricity in the first place. Im not sure how the discounts will work but each month we pay about $100-$120 every month with it. 

Our bill says delivery charges and generation charges. So shouldni be switching to TOU or keep it the same? At a supercharger it seems cheaper to charge there rather than at home at all if i was to charge at like 12am or something when i should be sleeping. What do you guys recommend?

"Minor annoyances switching to TeslaFirst don‚Äôt get me wrong I absolutely love my car. But it isn‚Äôt perfection and I think many new buyers want to know what are the cons? I couldn‚Äôt find much so here‚Äôs a small list of mine. What are yours?

1. Too many Messages. Everything pops up on screen now. Middle of driving? Clear this pop up message.

2. On that, the screen. It‚Äôs beautiful but having to look down and to the right while driving is not great. A projection to the windshield for basic data would‚Äôve been a necessity in this car at this price, imo.

3. Parallel parking. Curb rash. I used to be a champion at parking less than an inch from the curb. I used to gently bump the wheel to the sidewalk and align. I am terrified at 10X that distance now due to the rims sticking out.

4. Burried menus. Again on the UI, you really have to read policies, enable permissions, and toggle features to get to what you want. 

5. Extra subscriptions. I understand having 24/7 connectivity is a cost to Tesla but it‚Äôs important to know the car is limited by how many subs you have. Even small things like needing a MyQ for your garage door.",11-19-2024
"Stuck in Morocco! Please HELP!I have a German Tesla Model Y that I took on vacation to Morocco. The car is currently parked in a garage in Casablanca.

A few days ago, I updated the software following Tesla's recommendation, and then went to bed. However, when I woke up the next morning, my car no longer recognized my key card, key fob, or phone.

I have spoken with the service center, and they asked me to tow my car to the nearest center, which is located in Malaga, Spain.

  
UPDATE:

Good news, everyone! I was able to unlock the car manually, and it is now fully functional. I want to thank everyone who took the time to share their ideas and solutions with me. I haven't had a chance to read all of your responses yet, but I truly appreciate your help.

Here‚Äôs what I ended up doing:

As you may know, this issue occurred after I performed an update, so I suspect it was caused by a faulty update. After trying all possible solutions, the only option left was to get inside the car.

I managed to use a small pump to slightly bend the window so I could slide a rod into the manual pull and open the door. Once inside, I found that the car was not fully responsive; for example, the windows control weren't working. However, some functions such as the climate control and audio system were operational.

The most critical issue was that my keys were not recognized by the car, even though they were inside. Fortunately, an update was pushed a day or two ago, and I was able to download it with very low connectivity. I seized the opportunity to install the update while staying inside the vehicle.

After the update, the car is now fully functional. I hope this situation never happens to anyone else, and I encourage you to consider this post if you are thinking about buying a Tesla or any electric vehicle.

Much love!",11-19-2024

"Cashier Checks LimitHi there,

I have a Cybertruck delivery this Wednesday. A SA contacted me through the app not to long ago and told me that they do not accept cashier checks worth over $50K. They recommended that I do a wire transfer. I'll be going to NFCU in the morning to see if they'd be able to split the cashiers check to two. I'm not sure if this'll work but it's definitely made me anxious and not sure what my options are if NFCU doesn't allow to split a cashiers check. I've contacted an NFCU rep not to long ago and she told me that it's not something they typically do but didn't give me a firm answer. Just kept saying that my best bet is to go in person and explain my situation.

Is anyone aware of this? Kinda upset to have a Tesla rep immediately tell me that their payment methods have changed recently to only allow a maximum of $50K for a cashier's check. Especially it being a day before delivery.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE: Tesla only accepts one cashiers's check. They do not accept two cashier checks. They only accept wire transfers if the price is over $50K.

"2022 Y stuck on FSD 12.3.6 but it's not a bad thing except for...So I bought my first Tesla. A used model Y Performance with 52k. So far I love the car all the way around!. It is in really good condition for a used car with that many miles. 

So I decided to do the monthly FSD subscription. I am loving it! I does a very good job driving me to work 53 miles one way with back roads then freeway then city traffic. It just works! BUTTTTTT I wish they would go back to 12.3.6 and scrub the steering wheel code! If I look away it would be good enough for me. The car yells at me when I block the camera or look away so I know it is watching me so why keep the ""touch the steering wheel"" code in there? 

  
Except for that one thing the FSD is great, even the summons works perfectly fine, no curb issues and it avoids people and cars just fine. It's just the non consistent steering wheel nagging that drives me crazy!

I think the only other thing I could ask Tesla to do is roll out a ""per audio source"" equalizer setting. I use Tune-in so I can keep listening to my favorite station and it needs help with the bass side so I set the bass higher. But whne I switch over to Youtube music for a playlist the bass is crazy so I have to go in an set it. So a ""per source"" equalizer setting would be great. If the car does that then I have no found it. The equalizer stays the same. no matter what plays, including youtube vids, Hulu, Disney+ and so forth.

"Steering Alignment Error after an update and lost features -- Advice Needed!Hey everyone! Right after my car updated last night, I ran into an issue on my first drive ‚Äî I got an error saying the steering needs alignment as FSD was driving me straight down a road. üòï The strange thing is, this happened immediately after the update, and suddenly, all my Tesla features (FSD, single-pedal driving, emergency braking, drive smoothing) just stopped working mid-drive and won‚Äôt turn back on. As I was driving an alert saying to take over immediately came up. Now my Model X drives like a regular car, with all the computer features disabled. I had to pull over to figure out what was going on because the way it drove/handled felt so different, and all the alerts popping up at the same time was very confusing!

I made a service ticket with Tesla and they want to do a steering alignment? I‚Äôm wondering if paying the $275 for a steering alignment will truly fix this, or if the timing with the update suggests something else might be going on? Could a steering alignment really cause all these systems to fail at once? Any insight would be super helpful. Thank you!

"The librating thing about leasingNotwithstanding the financial implications between leasing, cash, financing, and their associated opportunity costs, it would seem to me that leasing (renting, really) a Tesla can be liberating.

Before Tesla, I bought large, highline cars and took good care of them inside and out.  I kept cars longer than 3 years, got floor mats, accessories and mods.  Even with my purchased Y, I PPF'd it, mats all over, and lots of mods and accessories.

Now that I am looking into leasing, the only thing I am going to do is tint and maybe a power frunk.  I will not PPF, no floor mats, and not spend money on other enhancements.  In 2 to 3 years, I will simply return the car.  I won't care about small stone chips.  If there are dings or dents that need to be repaired, I will still be ahead than compared to PPF.  I will also be more relaxed about people eating in my car.  As long as it cleans up, what do I care?  In 2 or 3 years, I might get HW5 or something new that is more fun.

"Installed these rear passenger door emergency release strapsI also shared this on the Model Y subreddit and aware this is may not be applicable for older models (but if you look at that thread, someone, offered a great suggestion). I repositioned the straps to be more discrete vs. my previous post as many suggested they were ""too accessible""

For those concerned about the strap being too accessible to children when the vehicle is in motion, you can tuck the strap under the mat. It still makes it easier to locate during an emergency if there is a loss of power. Note the strap is velcroed and you have to pull the entire strap off the felt first in order to engage the door pull mechanism.

I bought these off AliExpress if you search for ""Tesla Emergency Door release strap"" there will be dozens of the same listings.

What spurred the idea, there was a crash [a few weeks ago here in Toronto ](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/fatal-crash-four-dead-lake-shore-cherry-1.7361751) with the driver crashing at an insane rate of speed with 5 occupants.

Within Tesla's Apple Music App however, I can't find a way to play individual songs.

"Tesla acquisition questions and curiosities  
1) If leasing, and buyback is not an option, why does the residual value even matter?  Aren't you basically renting a car for the term?

2) Can one order a car using ""cash"" now, and later decide on a) trade in another Tesla, b) switch to lease?

3) Can one order a car selecting ""lease"", and later switch to cash or finance?

4) The Fed tax credit is $7500.  As I understand, if one is buying an X with options (over $80K), then there is no tax credit, but Tesla has a $7500 lease incentive.  Is that correct?

5) Following up to #4, I presume it is either/or $7500 Fed credit OR lease incentive.  In other words, if one leases an X without options (under $80K) and it qualifies for the Fed credit, there is no $7500 Tesla lease incentive?

6) Is there still a loyalty discount of $1000 for existing Tesla owners?

7)  I read that there is no early lease termination other than paying off the lease, even if getting a newer Tesla.  Is this correct?

8) Does anyone have a copy of the full lease contract or a link?  It would be interesting to see all the fine prints. 

9) Does anyone expect the X price to drop any lower?

"FSD 12.5.6.3 is a step backwards, and even dangerousI've been using FSD since I got my Model Y back in April. And for the most part, have been enjoying the overall experience. Makes my 30 minute commute to/from work more relaxing. I use it every opportunity I get.

I updated to the latest 12.5.6.3 build on Tuesday and after a few days, it is step backwards in some ways, and even dangerous in others. I have now stopped using it when my wife/kid are in the car with me.

1. My biggest quirk with it is how aggressively it slows to a stop. On most situations, when there is a red light, the car doesn't slow down to a stop gradually. Instead, it takes the top speed, then aggressively slows down to stop at the red light. My wife literally yells at me to slow down as she thinks I won't stop in time and will drive into oncoming traffic. It happened enough that she told me to stop using FSD.
2. During my drive to work, where I turn into the parking lot of my office building, the car is going 50mph. But it doesn't slow down fast enough before making the turn. I can feel the car applying the brakes aggressively at the end right before making the turn into the parking lot. It's jarring.
3. As others have mentioned, it takes freeway exits WAY to aggressively. It's pretty scary when the car feels like it's about to lose control on an exit turn.

As to the dangerous (and illegal) maneuvers.

1. On one of the street that I take on my way home, I'm supposed to make a left turn. There is a single left turn lane. The car will signal to make a left turn, but DOES NOT go into the left turn lane. Instead it slows down and remains on the lane next to it that is supposed to go straight.
   1. If the left lane signal is red, but the light to go straight is green, the car will STOP at that lane and wait to make a left. Very dangerous and of course illegal. Cars behind me stop, honk, and are obviously pissed off.
   2. If the left lane signal is green, but the light to go straight is red, the car will MAKE the left turn using the middle lane! Again, dangerous and illegal.
2. On one of the freeway exits, the car signals to make a left after it exits. There are 2 lanes, one to make a left turn and one for right turn. There were 5+ cars making a left turn. The Tesla aggressively drives fast on the RIGHT TURN LANE, but signals to turn left. It then proceeds to turn left, from the right turn lane! I got honked at, but if those cars making a left tries to get into the right lane, it could hit me.

I haven't noticed any real 'improvements' yet with 12.5.6.3",11-15-2024

"My Tesla with an expanding solar roof -- generates 4.5kwh per dayHello Reddit, this is an update of the last year worth of work on a personal project of mine -- placing an expandable solar array on my Tesla. And like all the past builds, the blueprints will be online for anyone to access. The last prototype Beta2 had lots of great feedback, and I am excited to share RC1 (Release Candidate 1). Officially the community is called [DartSolar](https://dartsolar.com) now, if you search online you can find our Reddit post from last year and all our blueprints.

https://preview.redd.it/wmzwpush541e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c6381084c14dc179fdd4d80426618f37c37d78

https://i.redd.it/ctxmyr9m341e1.gif

This is a 1kw solar array, composed of 6 smaller custom solar panels. These smaller solar panels are more serviceable, easier to replace, and makes it cheaper to fix. The roof rack uses custom made telescopic tubes make of aluminum (mostly), and some one segment made of stainless steel that I'm planning to replace with carbon fiber. However, when I release the blueprints I'll have the aluminum and carbon fiber specifications. You can get the blueprints of Beta2, and get these blueprints [here](https://dartsolar.com).

https://i.redd.it/aua77z4g441e1.gif

The entire design had to be aerodynamic af. I wanted no more than 2% aerodynamic drag loss. So I tested different designs on a 10-mile stretch where I would drive with the DartSolar on and off. The current model is about 1-inch tall, we created a custom made roof rack support to further decrease the height. Because the whole thing is flat we've observed 1% drag loss when driving at 30 mph, and about 2% when driving at 60 mph. In my daily commute I rarely go over 60 mph.

https://i.redd.it/77di9blfx31e1.gif

The solar panels are locked when driving by magnetic locks. That way they are very easy to open, but also the panels will not open when you're driving. In the blueprints I'll also add a mechanical lock to absolutely ensure the panels stay in place. But overall, I want the panels to open easily so anyone in my family can open and close them easily. The easier it is, the more daily use. Also, I'm excited that Perovskites finally made it to production level solar panels this year via Oxford PV. Which means that solar panels might produce 30% more power in the coming years.

https://i.redd.it/6wzwy608y31e1.gif

This is another view of how thin it is from the side. You can see the ocean behind the vehicle in between the glass top and the bottom of the roof rack. The roof rack also has four keyed locks to prevent theft. Also, the solar panels are epoxied in such a way that a thief would render the solar panel useless if they tried to lift it (the solar cells would crack).

https://preview.redd.it/uqxrmlpky31e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d49cdce09e03873e3988ba45a8dac086e0283c7c

This is another angle how large the panels are. They have been designed to fit in a standard US-parking spot without the risk or hurting anyone. In the sense that the solar panels do not go beyond the shadow of the vehicle.

[Washing and drying the DartSolar](https://reddit.com/link/1gs3w77/video/8af9baxty31e1/player)

Another requirement was that the roof rack would be water resistant and be able to withstand 50 mph winds. In the video above I am soaking it, but also using a 55+ mph wind blower to dry the car. The blower doesn't even move the solar panels or the mechanics. We did a small wind test and it didn't break either. We did a failure test and each of the solar sheets that expand could hold 90 lbs. before they plastically deformed.

https://reddit.com/link/1gs3w77/video/rekf147bz31e1/player

In this video the power flow for the DartSolar is shown. The solar panels charge a power unit, and the power unit charges the vehicle -- off-grid. The power unit we use in REALLY bulky, and there are smaller ones. We use the EcoFlow Delta Pro, but you can use whichever you like. In this video you can also see the optional ""Cargo"" feature we have -- this allows anyone to also cargo about 50 pounds on top of the solar panels when driving without damaging them.

**Future goals**

If you like this concept let me know, DM me, or visit [dartsolar.com](http://dartsolar.com) to get updates. My personal goals are now to develop a version that also expands side to side, very similar to Beta2, but the expansion is only half-width, meaning instead of 6 solar panels, we will have 12. That would increase daily production to about 9kwh, and if solar panel efficiency increases with Perovskites and tandem solar cells, then that same future model will deliver a whooping 12kwh per day -- not taking into account conversion losses.

In the future I'd also like to introduce more carbon fiber into DartSolar so that the roof rack is higher allowing for more cargo weight. The Tesla roof load limit is about 155 pounds. Currently the solar panels weight 45 pounds, and the mechanics also weight 45 pounds. Introducing carbon fiber would decrease the overall weight, allowing for more cargo on the roof rack.

Here you can see I have loaded a ladder and a Persian rug on top of the solar panels by using the ""Cargo"" feature that has been added to this model.

"Just ordered a S3XY KnobI just saw that Enhance Auto released a new update with some pretty awesome features, and decided to take advantage of the Black Friday discount!

I like the no button approach that Tesla has... sometimes.... I can do most of what I want via the screen when I'm driving, but I think the S3XY knob will just make things a lot easier.

I'm also curious about turning off the front motor, and drift mode...

I might also be adding a phone mount to run their app, so I can see more data from the car.

Highland owners, I'm gonna be so jealous of the ambient lighting tweaks!

I‚Äôm looking for advice on an issue I‚Äôm having with a recent order from the Tesla store.

"Looking for advice - Tesla model s 2016My Tesla model s 2016 has been having a ton of issues, I'm hoping you guys can give me some insight into what's happening and some suggestions. 

First off the center console no longer navigates properly. It either freezes at navigation system is initializing, or it says there is no navigation data. I've heard this was a symptom of a faulty emmc, but my car doesn't seem to have the recall for it? 

Secondly, the back door is a wall. The inside latch doesn't open the door, the outside handle does not present. I was able to open it with the mechanical override that's it. The window is rolled all the way up but the app tells me the window isn't shut every time I get out of the car. 

Thirdly, my front door is slowly becoming unresponsive completely. It started with my mirror, sometimes it wouldn't properly open back up when I got in the car so I would have to do it manually, Ive since turned off the auto folding. The inside handle has no issue but the outdoor handle occasionally fails to retract, and then wont open the car properly as if it's locked. When this happens the side panel becomes completely unresponsive and I can't open any windows or operate the side mirrors with it. It seems to me as if the door suddenly has no power at all, unless the handle inside isn't mechanical because the inside handle works in all situations. It's slowly happening more frequently like it has Alzheimer's or something it's fine some days and bunk the next. 

I'm thinking this must be an electrical issue, surely every mechanical part in my car didn't fail at the same time and only on one side. I'm not sure I can afford repairs right now and I have to get in and out of my car like 20 times a day so the door working is essential. I'm handy mechanically and have experience putting together computers so if it's something that can be fixed at home with a part let me know. ",11-15-2024
"Tesla Navigation Weirdness: Why does it choose this route?
I‚Äôve noticed something frustrating with Tesla‚Äôs navigation. Instead of taking a simple, direct route, Tesla‚Äôs nav is sending me on a weird detour that doesn‚Äôt make sense, I have the new updated Nav too. Here‚Äôs the issue:

I live in Toronto, and this is a major intersection. Maybe top 10 most popular intersection in the city.

Tesla‚Äôs navigation has me go out of the way, taking a longer path through a less major street. This means I end up having to wait through longer red light and make an unprotected left turn, which isn‚Äôt exactly safe or efficient.

In contrast, Google Maps, Apple Maps, and honestly any human would just go straight through the main intersection, saving time and avoiding the mess of the detour. It‚Äôs clearly the quicker and safer option, but for some reason, Tesla‚Äôs nav ignores it entirely.

I've checked at various times‚Äîmorning, evening, 2 a.m., and 6 a.m.‚Äîand it just doesn't notice the obvious.

From start of the green arrow to end of green arrow is like 2 min drive, 5 min walk

After Jason's rigorous review, Hagerty deems the M3P the vehicle to choose

Ofcourse, motoring is subjective but it's good to see that Tesla is moving in a notable direction concerning sport driving.

To my M3P people, are any of you running a different set of tires or wider tires.

"Google Home Tesla voice Control via TaskerAnyone interested in using Google Home/Assistant, you can use Tasker to get voice Google Home control over your car to do things like open the frunk for minimal cost and no subscription.

1. Get Tasker and open it and accept the permissions it asks for.

2. Buy Bolt for Tesla - Tasker Plugin on Play Store and install it, giving any permissions it asks for.

3. Follow the instructions in this Reddit post(props to u/joaomgcd) to setup Google Home to be able to voice control Tasker tasks. I would recommend being sure you have their example task working before moving on to making your own. Follow their steps, import the Tasker Profile. https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/s/wmKPCjmXYb

4. After you install the Tasker Profile in step #3 you need to make some Tasks in it under the Profile imported in step 3. Things like 'open frunk' then use Actions from the Bolt for Tesla plug-in which are easily found by typing in Tesla in the Actions search then hit Configuration in the top right of your new Task. The first one you do you will need to setup your Tesla key. You will see options, I'd suggest the Wake Car one and the notification if you want it. Test these from Tasker to make sure they work.

5. Now you need to again follow the instructions in Step #3 to set those commands up in home.google.com under the Tasker Automation that was created in step 1 of that post. You will repeat the starters & actions in there for each voice controlled Tasker task putting them all under the single Automation. Make sure once you are done to hit Validate, and then be sure to set it to Active and then save.

6. Test. If you can do it with a phone and see what it is interpreting your words as this will be helpful because for instance it often hears 'frunk' as frank or from and my car named Ares it parses as Aries so all my starters are spelled that way. To setup multiple starters on an action repeat the type, event data, is above that action only changing the is to your new starter. You can also test it by testing the Tasker Automation in Google Home, just be aware it will trigger every Automation you've setup when done this way. 

If you've never used Tasker it does have a learning curve. There are tons of videos and other resources available. You don't need to be an expert but basic app usage is all you need to do this. Be sure to give Tasker the permissions it asks for. 

On the Google Home side, as you're adding more voice actions in the scripter be sure your indentation matches.

Be sure to test every step of the way as you setup each piece. This will help you determine what may not be working if you have issues at the end. If there is an issue with your Google Home script formatting it will indicate the line with the issue(often indentation).",11-14-2024
"Tesla Announces V4 Supercharger Cabinet[Video Link](https://x.com/TeslaCharging/status/1857133110930063398)

Article Contents:

Supercharging has come a long way ‚Äî our first opening in 2012 started with charging speeds of just 90kW.

Since then, our engineering teams have continuously been upgrading our Supercharger equipment.

In 2023, we launched our V4 Post, which made improvements to the charging experience for all EVs.

Today, we're announcing the V4 Cabinet ‚Äî capable of delivering up to 500kW for cars and 1.2MW for Semi.

* Faster charging: Supports 400V-1000V vehicle architectures, including 30% faster charging for Cybertruck. S3XY vehicles enjoy 250kW charge rates they already experience on V3 Cabinet ‚Äî charging up to 200 miles in 15 minutes.
* Faster deployments: V4 Cabinet powers 8 posts, 2X the stalls per cabinet. Lower footprint and complexity = more sites coming online faster.
* Next-generation hardware: Cutting-edge power electronics designed to be the most reliable on the planet, with 3X power density enabling higher throughput with lower costs.

Our first sites with V4 Cabinets are going into permitting now. First openings in 2025.",11-14-2024

"Question for longtime owners and Tesla nerds about degradationI bought my first Tesla two months ago, a used 21 MYLR with accel boost and 20k miles for $28k. I drive a lot for work and the savings over gas is tremendous! 

I have been tracking degradation using the Tessie app as well as the energy app calculation (average consumption * projected / battery percentage) and both are showing an average of about 69.5 kWh capacity or 12.x% degradation 

I understand that is high for the year and mileage but also that every pack is unique.

My question for the long timers is, did any of you experience a high initial degradation like that, and if so did it affect the longevity of the pack? 

I typically keep cars 7-8 years and that was my intention with this one however I don‚Äôt want to face a battery replacement when the warranty is up which, at my rate of driving, will be coming up in 3-4 years.

"[Dilemma] New Grad | Confused between a Used or New 2024 model 3 refresh or a basic Toyota/Honda (temporary). Suggestions please.I'm a 24-year-old fresh graduate tech enthusiast who's been dreaming of owning a Tesla for years. I'm considering buying my first car and am torn between a used Tesla Model 3 (\~$30k) and the 2024 Model 3 refresh LR AWD ($50,000). While financially, a used car makes complete sense, the 2024 refresh is hard to resist.  I have seen countless videos about the differences at this point and I think I'm leaning towards the 2024.  
  
I'm looking at this as a long-term purchase (8-10 years) and don't want to regret later that I didn't get the 2024 version.

I used to earn $55,000 annually for 4 months but now I accepted a job offer at Amazon in Redmond, WA, and will be earning $130,000 base + $40,000 RSU/bonuses = $170,000 annually. Single, no dependents. I'll be getting a lump sum of $45,000 as a signing bonus in a month.

I am open to buying just a Toyota or Honda but I know I'd be tempted to sell that and buy a Tesla in 2 years or less. It's the one thing I want to splurge on. I do not spend money on any other luxury items.

"Used Model 3 Performance Reliability/ U.S. Tax Credit     Just trying to gauge if this is a good idea. For context, I'll soon be graduating from college with no debt but do still live with my parents so I can pay for school and other expenses. I'm a performance driving enthusiast and currently own a daily driver as well as a more focused sports car. If I sold both and used some of my savings I could afford to spend around $20k on a vehicle. I like that the car would have AWD which is great for the snow and makes winter driving less of a hassle and can be my daily and fun car at once. 
     I'm more so trying to understand if I can really afford one. I know my budget is a bit low for an M3P but I was hoping I could file independently to be eligible for the 30%, up to $4000 tax credit to keep the car in line with my budget. I wasn't sure if anyone here would have experience with doing the same. I just want to ensure I'd actually be eligible. 
     Finally, l'm concerned about reliability. I have seen great reviews from people especially about the model 3's reliability and low maintenance costs.

"Pulled the trigger on this Quicksilver Model Y for $40,290 out the door at 0% APR for 60 monthsI recently upgraded from my 2021 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus to this brand new 2024 Quicksilver Model Y Long Range Rear Wheel Drive and feel like I stole the car.

For context, I financed the 2021 Model 3 with $0 down at 2.5% when Tesla was running a spec promo rate back then. My amount financed was $42,790 & I had to pay for taxes and fees upfront (around $4 400 if | remember correctly) for a total cost of ~$47,100. My monthly payment was $646 and I still owe $21,000 and some change on the auto loan. My insurance was $126 / month.

Fast forward to now: I financed the 2024 Tesla Model Y with $5,349.88 down at 0% APR for 60 months. My amount financed is $34,694 and my monthly payment is $578. My insurance payment is still the same. On this new purchase, I received the:

$1,000 military discount 
$500 referral credit 
$7,500 federal tax credit 
$3,760 demo model price adjustment

This brings my total savings to $12,760. On top of this, the ""demo"" model was actually only a showroom model with 15 miles on the odometer, so it was never used on test drives. When I picked up the car, I was kinda nervous there might be a scratch or scuffs from all the people sitting in the car but it was absolutely flawless.

So to summarize: I have a brand new car with way more cabin and trunk space. I now get way more range and the ride quality is so much more comfortable. The fit and finish of the Model Y just feels so much better than the 2021 Model 3. I also have the updated FSD computer (HW4) which runs so much better on the same FSD software (12.5) as compared to my 2021 HW3 Model 3. The Model Y also has the AMD Ryzen chip so the touchscreen processes things much faster. My warranty periods are all reset with this new car and I was able to achieve ALL of this with a lower monthly payment (saving $68 / month) and no change in insurance. I also dropped my rate from 2.5% down to 0%? I was trying so hard to wait till December to pull the trigger on a last minute Model Y deal to get the best deal possible but I honestly don't know how it could ever get any better than this. The only things I could see me missing out on by not waiting are possibly free supercharging or FSD trials which really don't matter to me. Maybe, just maybe, the price adjustments for inventory models will increase or the base price of vehicles will decrease a little towards the very end of the year but I didn't want to chance it and wait to only get stuck with a spec I didn't like or want. I wanted the 19 inch wheels for extended range which I got and the Quicksilver color is just the cherry on top, it is so beautiful.

So what are the cons? The biggest thing that bothers me about the Model Y Long Range Rear Wheel Drive is that the it has non-functional fog lights. The next ""con"" is that it obviously isn't as zippy off the line as my Model 3, but at around 30-40 ish mph if you punch it, the acceleration is near identical, or at least it feels that wav. It's still very fast and faster than the majority of ICE vehicles on the road. I know people complain about the sound system a lot on Reddit but honestly it's pretty much similar to my Standard
Range Plus Model 3. Maybe the Model 3 was just slightly better sounding. However, I didn't have the Long Range version so am not comparing it to the ""premium"" sound I guess, but what I'm trying to say is that it's just fine. At max volume it's plenty loud and clear. The last ""con"" but not really a ""con"" I can think of is that it's rear wheel drive. Now this I think can be a ""pro"" or a ""con"" depending on where you live. I live in SoCal so for me l feel like this is a huge ""pro"" because I never have to worry about snow or crazy rain, so the benefits of the increased traction don't really apply to me. Additionally, the All Wheel Drive dual motor version increases weight and thus has a slight reduction in range which is a con for me and not worth the better traction. Since the car is also heavier, I would imagine the agility or performance in corners is also slightly changed, at least from what l've read online. I haven't been able to confirm this myself as I haven't driven the AWD version but the RWD version definitely does feel like it's on rails similar to my RWD Model 3, especially for being a compact/crossover SUV.

Now what am I going to do with the Model 3?
Well I'm going sell it forsure and the used car market is obviously horrendous, but I received an offer from CarMax for $23,000 for my Model 3. That's a HUGE plus for me and I was kinda shocked my monthly payments kept up with the depreciation of my Model 3 and some! I think this is likely because my APR was pretty low only at 2.5% back in 2021, so not a ton of my monthly payment was going towards interest. The fact alone that I am not underwater on this loan feels like a huge win already lol

I wanted to make this post to share my experience upgrading my Tesla from the Model 3 to the Model Y to inform potential Model Y owners of the deals out there right now and the pros/cons of my new vehicle. I also thought I was getting a killer deal in 2021 and I think I truly was...until the federal incentive quickly outpaced my deal. Looking at it now, I can't believe l've been paying a $646 / month for a 2021 RWD Model 3 for so long‚Ä¶when I originally bought my Model 3 I did so with the intention that it would be my ""forever"" car that I would drive into the dirt. I now have the same intention with buying this new Model Y and only did so because of how good a deal I was getting. I‚Äôm not one to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù every year but this deal was just too sweet to pass up and it would have to really be something amazing to get me back into a new car loan after this!

I‚Äôm about to buy my first Tesla, and I‚Äôm torn between the new Highland Standard Range and the previous Performance model (I‚Äôm in Germany).

From what I can see, the prices for used Teslas are quite similar between the current Highland SR and the previous Performance model (2022 built year).

I love the power of the Performance model, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd actually use it every day.

Which one would you go for? And why?

"Frequency of Rear-EndersI have noticed quite a few ‚Äúrear-ender‚Äù accident posts in model specific subs.  It had  me questioning whether the brake lights are effective enough on Teslas.

In one pedal driving, a certain threshold of deceleration triggers the brake lights.  Vs. manually applied brake lights; where an attentive, skilled and defensive driver can purposely trigger the brake lights in certain scenarios when they anticipate a sudden deceleration that might catch following drivers off-guard.

In addition to driving a Tesla, ride motorcycles and bicycles where survival through situational awareness includes what‚Äôs happening behind me.  Between my training and 1/2 million safe driving miles, I have learned to anticipate sudden stops and telegraph my intentions, in advance, for others to see when traffic is stop & go.  Lightly dragging the brake as I coast up to stopped/slowing traffic for instance, or pumping the brake (light) on and off when I sense the approaching driver in my rear-view mirror may be closing in too quickly.

Trying to accomplish the same defensive technique isn‚Äôt possible with Tesla.  I‚Äôm bound to the deceleration sensor array to broadcast my intent (accelerometers, and accelerator and brake pedal positioning, I assume).  What‚Äôs concerned me most is how I can lightly decelerate and not trigger the brake lights. The frequency of rear-end collision pics in Tesla subs has me concerned about being rear-ended myself!!

Thoughts anyone?",11-10-2024

**Offer 1**

Trim: Long Range

Color: Black int, Gray ext

Mileage: 62k

Notes: The dealer uploaded several photos of the different menus. and there are some service warnings visible. These include ""Tire Pressure Monitoring System fault"", ""Condition Detected with a vehicle controller, ""Unable to charge, maximum charge level reached"" ( I think that's normal, but this one has the same yellow caution symbol as the others), ""Front passenger safety restraint system fault"", and ""Schedule service to replace low voltage battery."" Some wear was also noticeable, such as the steering wheel appearing to be slightly wrinkled.

**Offer 2**

  
Trim: Standard Range Plus

Color: Black int, White ext

Mileage: 51k

Notes: It seems to be in great condition other than this weird splotching on the side of the front passenger seat. This dealer had fewer pictures of the interior and screen, but the only sort of warning that was visible was this one with a cellular icon, which I believe says something about Premium Connectivity, which seems to be normal.

"2017 Model S not respecting scheduled charging hoursHi everybody,

I'm looking to the wisdom of Reddit to help me with an issue I am facing with my car. 

My electricity gets way cheaper after midnight so I have set the car to start charging at 12:30 a.m. Monday through Sunday. 

However, I have found that whenever I plug my car into my Tesla wall charger, the car chooses to disobey the schedule and starts charging immediately. Even if I stop the charging right after plugging the car in, the car will start charging again within 60 seconds. 

It's the strangest thing because the app says charging will start at 12:30 a.m., and yet the car is charging now.

"Test drove a Tesla Y, sad to say, we were not fans(Repost of a deleted post in accordance with sub rules)

For years, I've been really wanting to try a Tesla Y (wife and I currently have a 2013 VW CC and 2015 Jetta), and we test drove a 2024 Model Y AWD for an overnight demo.

We went in with high hopes and came out very disappointed:

* Terrible ride quality, does it even have a suspension? We felt every bump in the road, including ones we couldn't even see. Our 2013 VW CC definitely felt better on the same roads, even the Jetta might have felt better.
* Even on smooth stretches of the highway, there was a constant bumping/lurching motion that made my wife nauseous; wasn't as extreme for me, but I definitely felt it too.
* The cabin was *so loud*! There was also this low pitch bumming/humming sound and pressure that made our ear drums hurt, especially at relatively low speeds on neighborhood roads. Road noise felt worse than the CC.
* Why are the automatic wipers turning on by themselves when there is no rain? and why does the radio come on randomly when we didn't touch anything? We had to turn off the volume completely to prevent it from turning on by itself randomly. The key card to lock and unlock was also inconsistent.
* We were hoping that FSD would save us from all these negatives. Well, on the highway it seemed OK, but based on my research it was effectively adaptive cruise control that most cars today can do decently. On surface roads it was nearly unusable - such aggressive acceleration, it was like a 0-60 demo every time the light turns green despite us trying to tune some of the knobs (reduce the relative speed limit, put it on chill, etc.). It's probably how a lot of people drive, but it's certainly not how we drive, and I don't think we'll get used to it. I remember reading someone saying it felt like a 16-year-old driving, and I can totally see that now.
* Not having 360 camera (something that I've seen pointed out in various Youtube videos) does feel like a drawback in tight spaces. Not used to the camera perspectives, and feel like there are still blind spots.
* On the plus side, we liked the size, the looks, and some of the tech (e.g. the visualization of cars around us when driving, the blindspot camera, the warning system that flagged when I accidentally got too close to the car in front of us, etc.).

How do people like their Teslas or non-Teslas? Anyone with similar experiences to us? Or did we just get unlucky with a bad Model Y?

Edit: whoa, lots of responses - thanks to everyone's response, I can't get through each one.

I will clarify about the lurching feeling: we felt it on the highway both when I was driving AND when FSD was being used and I did not have my foot on the pedal. I admit that it took me a while to get used to one-foot driving, but I thought that I had decent control of it on the high way stretch at least. However, I'm going to trust FSD as the ""right"" way to do it (as it kept it at a mostly constant speed), and if it still lurched, then that's no longer user error on our part.",11-21-2024

"NACS J3400 will take over as the DC charging standard in NA, but what about AC charging?As new car models incorporate NACS/J3400, this connector will overtake CCS.

For public DC charging, the non-superchargers will be slowly retrofitted.

But, how will the public switch to NACS for AC charging?  
Homeowners with existing J1772-only EVSEs can use an adapter or swap for a NACS connector (is this even possible without changing the entire EVSE?)  
At the moment it seems that the Tesla Universal EVSE is the only future-proof EVSE.  Are their others?

Public AC chargers will need to continue to support J1772.  Will they require owners to use an adapter, or will they be retrofitted to support a magic-dock-style connector like the Tesla Universal EVSE?  Hopefully Chargepoint and others are planning for this second option.

Are car manufactures going to start using NACS connector on their PHEVs as it doesn't make much sense to stick with J1772?  I haven't heard of this happening yet.",11-19-2024

"Test drove a few EVs, and here are my very brief takeawaysMy model Y lease is ending and I won‚Äôt be getting another one. Over the past few days I test drove the following in hopes of finding a replacement:

1. Bmw IX x drive40 - felt plenty powerful even with the base motor. Rear seat had good room. However the front seat wasn‚Äôt that comfortable given the price point, and the interior felt impressive at first, until I stepped inside the Mercedes. The ride quality, handling, sound insulation and sound system were sublime. The cargo space was surprisingly small for such a large vehicle. 

2. Mercedes EQE SUV 350 - felt downright slow compared to the IX, but more than adequate for most daily drives. Like the IX, the trunk looked smaller than the compact model Y. The exterior styling resembled a blob with a Mercedes logo. But the interior was truly a showstopper even without the hyper screen. The seats felt the most comfortable and thickly padded out of the cars I tested. 

3. Tesla Model X - terrifyingly quick, and has the familiar tesla UI. It‚Äôs also the most useful for my particular needs, which is occasional use of the third row, supercharger access for longer trips, and larger cargo area relative to the Mercedes and bmw. Honestly, the interior isn‚Äôt as bad as people say, sure it doesn‚Äôt have the ambient lighting and design details of the Germans, but it‚Äôs still a tangible upgrade over the model Y. But I didn‚Äôt care for the haptic turn signals on the steering wheel and shifting through the touchscreen as well. Ride quality is good even with the 22 inch wheels.

4. Rivian R1S dual motor - this one was the biggest surprise. Despite the positive reviews I read online, the R1S was clearly my least favorite out of this group. It had the worst ride quality regardless of which suspension setting I used, even thought I tempered my expectations since this is an off road capable vehicle. The electric motors were loud, and the interior was a chorus of squeaks and rattles that made the tesla Model X look like a model of pristine build quality. I know I‚Äôll get bashed by rivian fans, but maybe I just test drive a bad example? The third row seat was more useful than the model X, but getting into the second row got me banging my head against the door opening. Rivians user interface was well designed and easy to navigate.

"EV Charger AustraliaI just need clarification that I understand what I want. I‚Äôm about to pick up my new BYD Atto 3 on Friday and am currently organising some kind of dedicated charger for it. 

Currently I don‚Äôt have a spare dedicated power point where the car is being held. Will I be okay to have it charge off a power board in the short term? I understand it definitely isn‚Äôt ideal but I‚Äôm not sure on the lead times to get an electrician out currently. I‚Äôm assuming if this is even an option it won‚Äôt be your budget board or extension cable from Bunnings. 

To that point also, I‚Äôm struggling to understand the differences of charging. I think I understand that level 1 is just a standard power socket. 
Level 2 charging then is essentially a dedicated charger? 

I see people online talking about a 32 amp socket, is this literally just a beefed up power socket capable of powering up to 32 amps that people are plugging the potable charger cable into? 
Or is this like a dedicated wall charger like a Tesla charger? 

I‚Äôm not so keen on something with insane capabilities in that I don‚Äôt need to control every aspect of it from my phone, I‚Äôd be okay with just a simple solution as I‚Äôm not a power user when it comes to driving my car. ",11-18-2024

The Mercedes CLA EV Will Have Both Tesla NACS And CCS Plugs [InsideEVs],11-18-2024
"New US and Canadian CCS chargers in October 2024
**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in October 2024,**¬†according to the US Department of Energy. You can¬†[get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in¬†r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""**¬†e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 290 CCS charging stations with a total of 883 (!!) chargepoints added or refreshed in October 2024.**¬†For comparison, there were 221 new CCS charging stations in October 2023, with 504 chargepoints. This month saw a dramatic increase in multiple ways: from last month, from last year, and in terms of chargepoints per station, which is very welcome news.

Some of these stations are Tesla Magic Dock stations. That makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:**¬†most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using PlugShare and the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

Tesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then there has clearly been a delay in the rollout. Ford, Rivian and GM owners can now order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle.

However, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only¬†*some*¬†CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, including locations that work with certain non-Tesla vehicles.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can¬†[sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

"Why are EVs so efficient?I know EVs are more efficient than gasoline engines which can convert only about 30-40% of the chemical energy in gasoline to kinetic energy. I also know that EVs can do regenerative braking that further reduces energy wasted. But man, I didn‚Äôt realize how little energy EVs carry.

"Roadtrip - Tallinn to Berlin chargers.Context:

Summer next year I'll be driving through Europe in my 2024 Tesla Model 3 LR.

I did a similar trip in the summer of 2023. The route was: 
Starting in northern Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Andorra, Spain, Monaco, Italy, Austria, Czechia and then back up through Germany.
This route was completely covered by Tesla Superchargers, so everything was pretty smooth and easy.

This year the route is a bit different. It'll start in northern Norway, then go down through Sweden and cross over from Stockholm to Tallinn. We'll be staying in the baltics for a while before heading to Berlin - then heading down through Prague and to the Italian and Swiss alps before driving back through Germany and Denmark.

The actual point:

In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland the Tesla supercharger network is extremely sparse, almost non-existent. I'll have to use other chargers.
So I'm wondering what are your experiences driving through these countries in an EV? Which chargers gave you a good experience, and which should I be avoiding? Do you have any other general tips for the baltic part of this trip?",11-17-2024
"We just got a Mercedes S Class Hybrid, are we good to use our existing Tesla charging station with an adapter?Sorry if this has been asked before, but when I asked the Mercedes rep he said he wouldn't recommend getting an adapter as it would cause some technical/compatibility issues which then voids the warranty, is this true? Would love to just get an adapter and get it over with rather than installing a whole separate charging station at home.

Thanks.",11-16-2024
"Driver assist features on city Street?Which electric vehicles have driver assist features that work on city streets ? 

I test drove a Rivian recently and was disappointed that only traffic aware cruise control works on city streets. Basic Tesla auto pilot has traffic aware cruise control on city streets, and also auto steer works to keep the car in the lane ‚Äì but not to make turns at intersections obviously. For some reason you have to pay for FSD in order to have the traffic aware cruise control stop at stop signs and red lights, even though FSD doesn‚Äôt have to be enabled for that to work.

I get that we are a long ways from level 5 self driving cars. What I don‚Äôt understand is why more cars don‚Äôt have driver assist features that work on city streets. Most driving is not on the highway and the accident data shows that drivers need all the help they can get. 

Correct me if I am wrong, but super cruise and blue Cruise don‚Äôt work on city streets either. ",11-16-2024

"I went to Toyota and had the worst buying experience of my life. I ended up buying a car from ‚Äúthe worst‚Äù car company in America and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!A terrible Toyota experience led me to buying a VinFast VF9. 

I went to Toyota and ended up leasing a beautiful VF9. Did I make a mistake?

I went to Toyota to check out a Grand Highlander hybrid but left because of the ridiculous markup and awful in store visit. The salesperson did not know anything and he had the worst attitude every time I asked a question and gave the most passive aggressive answers

1. How many Grand Highlanders are there?
- whatever is in the lot‚Ä¶
2. Do you have any Hybrid MAXs?
- I haven‚Äôt checked‚Ä¶.
3. What is the lease price?
- We don‚Äôt lease Toyotas‚Ä¶

I left furious because I was ready to buy today and have all my docs and everything. I let the manager know and he seemed as annoyed to talk to me as the salesman! No apologies and no help and kept trying to push me away saying things like ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it‚Äù or ‚Äúgo to a different dealership‚Äù etc.

Across the street, there was a Vinfast dealership and I decided to walk in and take a look because I‚Äôve never seen a Vinfast in person. I walked in and was approached by the nicest and most friendly employee who was happy to converse with me and practically gave me a 2 hour lecture all about the company, the vehicles and their plans for further expansion into the US.

I‚Äôve always been skeptical about Vinfast especially after the really negative reviews of the first VF8s back in 2023 but I test drove the VF9 and was blown away‚Ä¶ The build quality and features felt so much better than the Grand Highlander it was almost incomparable. The vegan leather (vinyl lol) felt great, power seats massage heat and ventilation on all 4 outboard seats, and the panoramic sunroof really made it feel like a special place to be.

The car isn‚Äôt perfect though. The turning radius is really wide, the sound system doesn‚Äôt match the price of the car and the overall width of the car is a surprising 88in wide!!!
 
I did an extended test drive about an hour and a half to test out all the ADAS systems since those were the biggest complaints of the VF8. While it wasn‚Äôt perfect,  it does a very good job in the highway.

All that being said, I went ahead and put a $200 deposit for a VF9 Plus reservation with a green exterior and saddle brown leather interior for a 3 year lease at $600/mo. It should be arriving next week

I know it‚Äôs a risk to buy a car from a 3 year old Vietnamese company in the US, but I see them in the same position as Hyundai and Kia in the 90‚Äôs and Honda or Toyota in the 70‚Äôs. They are building their brand and they work with some the best companies like Pininfarina for design and BMW for the platform and interior, and I was told that they took an entire software department from Tesla to help improve their ADAS systems.

I feel good about it but now I‚Äôm getting second thoughts. What do you folks think?

TLDR: The Toyota car purchasing experience was so awful I bought an EV car from ‚Äúthe worst rated ‚Äù car company in America.  I couldn‚Äôt be happier

"Renting an Electric VehicleSo we'll be in the Pacific Northwest for about ten days. We plan to drive from Seattle to Vancouver, BC, and then to Kamloops and back to Seattle.  It looks like we can rent a Chevy Bolt (""or similar"")!  But we don't currently own an EV, so we are a bit lost.  To wit:

I've driven a Tesla rental before, and I know they have supercharging stations. I know you can program your route into the computer and it'll tell you where the stations are and where the ideal points are for stopping.  But that was also like three years ago.  Does the Bolt have similar stations these days?  Does it have a similar trip planning feature?  Can I charge a Bolt at a Tesla supercharging station?  I apologize if these are the dumbest questions you've ever heard.

I'm sure there are plenty of chargers along I-5 and in Vancouver. But what about between Vancouver and Kamloops?  Where could I find this information online?

Before I reserve a car and then discover it's undriveable, essentially.

Thanks!

"Tips for a weekend trip with a 2023 Polestar 2 rental? (figuring out charging stations)I decided to visit some friends while visiting family in Texas. Since I flew there, I rented a car, getting an EV (the Polestar), as it was the best deal, thinking I wouldn't be driving more than 150 miles total. My friends decided they want to go camping at the beach this weekend, which would be about a 280 mile roundtrip, meaning I would probably have to charge twice - once on the way down, then again back north. I'm trying to do the necessary logistical research.

It seems like the most reliable charging stations would be Tesla, based on speed and location. I downloaded the Tesla app because I read that you need it to pay for the charging and it can tell you which locations have hookups for non-Teslas (and just letting you know in general where the charging stations are). I have a Samsung Galaxy S9, no problems with the phone, but the app is glitchy on my end. Pressing the find my location button doesn't always work, it won't let me press the button that says to add my vehicle, the list of chargers in a location are not sorted by distance (even though it supposedly says they are), and the list of stations doesn't seem to match up with what Google Maps is telling me. Any suggestions specific to figuring out the Tesla stuff?

And I see a lot of ""Destination Chargers"". What's the protocol/etiquette for using those? Are they open to the public, or merely for the destination customers (like if are a paying guest at the motel)? However, it looks like most/all are slow chargers, but if my need to charge is dire...

A Blink charging station a little north of my friends has two good reviews. One near my destination has one single bad review. Both are supposedly fast chargers (the bad review claimed that his car was being charged slow at 36 kw). Those familiar with Blink - are they pretty reliable or not?

The only other major thing I know about charging stations is watching some CNBC videos about EVs on YouTube. In one, the person went to different charging stations (in California, I think) and documented the ones that were under maintenance, not working, etc. (Spoiler alert: it was bad.) So any advice about successfully doing a beach trip in my rental EV would be appreciated. Worst case scenario, probably decide beforehand to cram into their gas car(s).",11-14-2024
"Porsche Panamera vs. Model 3We see a lot of odd comparison on YouTube that make little sense though no doubt good for clicks and points.

This one was total happenstance.   The Model 3 was in the shop for PPF on a new bumper.   The shop gave me a ride to Enterprise to pick up a car.   I'd asked for an electric but none to be had on short notice.  The ride by the way was in a Mercedes EQS...holy smokes is that a great EV...but we digress.  

Get to the Enterprise place to pick up some small SUV and it turns out to also be Enterprises Exotic Car Rental spot and on the lot is a gorgeous white Porsche Panamera with less than 1,000 miles on it. What the heck, lets check out one of the penultimate gas luxury vehicles.  So I rent it for the day.

A sweet ride, drips luxury, handles well, great electronics integration with all virtual dash.  Has Apple Car Play which instantly recognized and worked with the iPhone,  Figure out all the stalks and dials and drive on out.  Drove it 50 miles to work and back in the rain.   Super solid.  A bit more wheel noise than I expected but solidly planted on the road.  Porsche has Siri integration via the iPhone and that worked great also.

You hit the accelerator and it roars and goes...BUT there is the slightest delay.  Stopping it coasts without braking...have to start using brakes.

Well after 100 miles....could not wait to get back to the EV Tesla which is quick, nimble and, while no inline screen, does provide a certainly competitive nav mapping and verbal commands.  And NO HESITATION...even the best ICE around will always have that where it makes noise but nothing happens. And I'm totally addicted to one pedal driving, nothing else makes sense.

Now I don't have to look at the luxury gassers and wonder what if...now a Porsche Taycan might be another story, combing Porsche luxury and handling with an EV heart...yikes.",11-14-2024

"Anyone driving a BEV with the original battery turning 10, 12, or 14 years soon?I hear a lot from EV proponents that liquid cooled batteries will outlast the vehicle (maybe that's 20 years from the in-service date).

I am sure some 2012 to 2015 Tesla Model S are still on their original batteries but anyone on this subreddit still driving an EV (bought new or used) that is about to hit 10, 12, or close to 14 years soon?

A friend has a '16 Model S (first owner and he has the lifetime free SCN charging that can be passed on to another Tesla vehicle) and he will be driving it into the ground because Tesla is offering him $15,000 trade-in value.

Would appreciate the model year, make and model of the vehicle, what has been fixed/repaired on the battery pack and odometer readings.  With 324K members, I'm sure some can share their wonderful experiences and convince people on the fence that batteries can easily last 16 if not 20 years.

"Texas residents write your Senator and Representative to keep the IRA EV incentives, perhaps only way to save it.Trump has bashed EV and promised to get rid of the any and all programs to make it easier to get a BEV (and renewable systems).  Do not count on Elon Musk saving that, he has voiced disagreement to it.  Yet it will not take much to change his mind.

Tesla Motors in now based in Austin, Texas and is a massive glowing jobs engine within literal sight of the Texas capital. It is obvious the loss of incentive will slow sales of Tesla cars, and impact jobs growth in Texas.

This is exactly the kind of news Trump would brag about endlessly and promote to keep that #1 spot.  To do that keeping the IRA intact is vital.

On aside, solar and wind growth in Texas is outpacing California, and may be second only to China in the world.  Another massive benefit for Texas.

"Election Implications for U.S. EV Tax CreditI'm an energy lobbyist in D.C. and kept this subreddit updated during the Inflation Reduction Act negotiations in 2022 that modified the EV tax credit. I wanted to share an update on where things stand.

**Why is the election important for the EV tax credit?**

While I, along with most of the D.C. world, viewed divided government as the most likely outcome of the election, Republicans have already gained control of the Senate (with a 3 vote majority buffer) and are favorites to take the House. At the time of this post, the House breakdown is 212 Republican, 199 Democrat, with 24 seats to be called. 218 seats cements the majority.

When one party controls the White House, Senate, and House, it unlocks a procedural tool called Budget Reconciliation. This avoids the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate that normally kills partisan legislation and is how the IRA was passed and Trump's 2017 tax cut bill was passed.

Many provisions from Trump's tax cuts start to expire in 2025 so he will be looking to take up another large tax reform bill. In order to pay for other priorities, like extending the increased standard deduction, higher child tax credits, and adding in some new priorities like possibly no taxes on tips or social security, they'll find offsets elsewhere in the law to repeal. Unfortunately, the EV tax credit will be one of the first things they go after.

**How will it change? Will they simply go back to how it was pre-IRA with caps for manufacturers?**

It's unclear how they decide to change it but the goal is to reduce the ""score"" which is just a term for how much a legislative proposal costs or saves the government. The cleanest path would be to simply sunset the EV tax credit. They could also make it so that it's impossible to qualify for the credit: reduce the MSRP of the cars that qualify even further or require the entire supply chain going into the car to be from the U.S. This would allow them to message that they preserved the credit but hey, you gotta build it here. I think this is less likely than sunsetting the credit. I don't see them going back to the pre-IRA version of the credit since the goal is to save money to fund other things.

**When might it change?**

it depends how quickly the budget reconciliation process moves. It's never as easy as people think it'll be particularly when you're tweaking the tax code. It might take most of the year. But to be conservative, I think it's very possible that calendar year 2025 would be the last time to buy an EV and get a credit.

**But Elon Musk is in the White House and he owns the largest EV company in the world...**

Yes, but what's a punch in the gut to Tesla is a shot to the head for Tesla's competitors. Tesla still has a massive advantage in the U.S. EV market and would do much better than companies that are still struggling to develop (and sell) EVs. Don't be surprised if Musk fully endorses initiatives that would benefit his company more than competitors **or** simply hurts them more than him.

**What should I watch for?**

First let's make sure that Republicans get the 218 seats. It's very likely they do, but it's not impossible that Democrats could sneak a razor thin majority.

Assuming they do, budget reconciliation efforts always start in the House with the Ways and Means Committee. They'll start to hold hearings and put out discussion documents for how they plan to address the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

While I'm fairly confident they will sunset the credit, what I'm not sure about is when. If the process moves quickly and they pass a bill in, say, July... do they say the credit only applies to purchases made on or before July 31, 2025? I tend to thing these things take longer than shorter, so if I was to make a wager I'd say anyone looking to buy an EV probably has most or all of 2025 to do it, but there's certainly danger that I'm wrong so the sooner the better. We'll only know for sure when we see legislative text which will take several months.",11-09-2024

"MOR-EV rebate with a salvage vehicle (Does it work?)Hey, I figured I would share my experience. 

I purchased a tesla from a New Jersey dealer and ended up getting a rebate from MA through the MOR-EV program.

The experience was so good, I decided I would try something outside the box...for science.

I bought a SALVAGE title tesla FROM A DEALER in New Hampshire (argo cycles)

(from a dealer is the MOST important aspect here)

After taking deliver I spent 6 weeks restoring the car, then I got the inspection done by the state police, registered the car, and applied for MOR-EV

Originally, they gave me some pushback because the vehicle was previously SALVAGED and was now REBUILT.

but, after I pointed out the following things, the situation changed.

* There is nothing that says it CANT be a salvage vehicle in the MOR-EV guidelines
* If anyone deserves the rebate, it's the guy who saved the electric car from the landfill LOL

After 2 weeks, they escalated my case to a higher up at the Department of Energy

7 days went by, I heard nothing.

I called the MOR-EV phone number, left a voice mail and BOOM, within a few hours, my application was accepted and they just mailed me a check for $5,000

  
What is the end result?

"What Trump‚Äôs Return Could Mean for the EV IndustryTrump just won, so I'm imagining there may be some changes to the U.S. EV business. The Rev Up America report credited rapid growth in the EV market to federal incentives, tougher emissions standards targeting automakers and a suite of clean energy policies enacted during Biden's presidency. Now, however, Trump is likely to roll back policies that would have mandated greenhouse gas emissions near-zero and incentive programs bringing EV tax credits, which could have accelerated adoption over time.

Large shifts may ‚Äî indeed should ‚Äî come in trade policy. Previously, Trump advocated for less dependency on China ‚Äî a move likely to entail higher tariffs on components of EV batteries coming from foreign markets. While this may strengthen domestic manufacturing, it would also increase EV prices to consumers.

Trump‚Äôs administration could also contest California's independent emissions standards followed by 17 other states. With Californian stances of less importance, automakers can back off the gas on zero-emission vehicle aims darkening green innovation.

This shift, while eroding some stability in the sector, isn't wiping out support from brands such as Ford and GM for green commitments. And Trump will have Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO, in his corner, seeking federal backing for self-driving technology (we expect). Plus other EV infrastructure improvements may not be pursued as quickly.

So in short, I'm expecting a new chapter of EV hurdles and openings, one that could redefine U.S. journey toward sustainable mobility as the industry adapts.",11-07-2024

2) for now financially healthy, but anemic profit margin: 

>SAIC, Changan, GAC, Leapmotor Stellantis, Chery.

I got out the car, opened the boot, got the cable, plugged it in to the car first then started pulling in the cable towards me as I was walking to the pole and it shocked the living daylights out of me. So much so I fell to the ground and had to take a minute to catch my breath it was like a donkey kicked me.

Few considerations I have gone through in my head;

* I had running shoes on so rubber
* I had no jacked generating static but that was a huge zap so no static
* There was a tesla charging in front of me but not sure how that can be relevant the car was not plugged in to the pole yet
* There was dew in the air and  on the ground but I had just parked and dry cable from the boot
* I had my phone in my one hand and a metal water bottle
* The car was not plugged in to the charging pole, have to repeat this I plugged the car in first then started walking over to the pole and ZAP. It was not continuous but my life did flash at that point in time so not sure if it was split second, or if I dropped the cable or pulled back as it zapped and let go of the cable.
* Cable not damaged, dry and well looked after
* Dew on the car, not sure after opening to plug it in if moist inside the plug in the car but not sure how that will travel along the cable.

Needless to say I remove the cable from the car carefully and not tried to plug it in yet, few calls to make.

Reason for the post is to share and find out if anyone else experienced this not only getting electric shock from VW ID.4 charging cable but any electric vehicle cable even before plugging in to charge.",11-05-2024

I thought it was interesting how the numbers worked out and the thought process for why they went EV and specifically Tesla. It's also worth watching the [council's questions section,](https://youtu.be/OHOuchLu9aA?t=644) where you will be able to specifically identify some of the recent content from various FUD articles thrown around, along with some excellent questions.

A lot of the reasons aren't Tesla specific.

* Significant fuel/energy savings
* Zero Emissions (Especially when idling)
* Safety
* Significant reduction in Maintenance costs (They are 2x over budget on their gas fleet)

Tesla stands out in the following ways

* Full Tesla warranty even once modified
* Modification speed (4-6 months vs 4 weeks)
* Single transaction
* Fleet management software
* \#1/\#2 selling model in the World/US
* Most American Made Car
* Lowest cost of ownership
* 5 star crash rating and rollover ratings
* Charging and Dealer Support Network.

Switching to EV has to compare well to their existing fleet of Ford Explorer and Chevy Tahoe platforms.  They have three platform rols; Patrol, Admin and Interceptor.  They don't feel EVs are ready for the Interceptor role yet.

"Renting EV in Seattle (Budget SEA) Visiting Seattle and Portland during thanksgiving and booked an EV from Budget at the airport for the trip. 
This will be my first time renting an EV for a long distance trip. Looking forward to it. Decided to book a non Tesla (Mach e or similar) 
Definitely give me a good idea on a long distance EV driving life. Excited for it. 
A long time lurker on the group. Looking forward it.

"Why an EV is the cheapest car to rent at the Tulsa airport.Flew into Tulsa a few weeks ago for a 24-hour project, just in and out. Amazingly, the cheapest rental at Avis is the EV category -- not the mini clown cars that are usually at the bottom of the list. So I bit on it. Turned out to be a good deal for me, but gotta be bad for Avis.

First, I ended up with a Ford Mach-E. I liked it a lot! Especially at the super-low price I paid! Why isn't everyone taking advantage of the deal????

So why aren't they? Once you leave Tulsa (if you don't know the area) you are officially in Bumfuck, Oklahoma. EV charging stations are few and far between. I'm sure every other prospective Avis EV renter was looking at the map and going, ""Holy crap, Batman. We'll get stranded. Give me a higher-priced IC!""

Second, they don't provide an adapter so that you can use whichever network of EV chargers you come across! The check-in guy blamed Ford for not supplying it. I'm sure Ford offers that for a price and Avis just decides to F their customers by not buying it. Anyway, I was overnight at the Shangri-La resort and they offered FREE EV charging, with a Tesla system. Couldn't use it, no adapter.

The"" return-full-of-gas"" rule that Avis has on ICs is so ingrained into my brain, that I didn't believe them when they told me at rental that as long as I had 5% left upon return, I was good. As long as they had enough juice to get it to a charger they were happy. How does that make sense (thinking from an Avis income perspective)? I paid Zero for the energy to drive 200 miles, instead of $25 for gas.

I did make it back, at 15% charge, but I have to admit I was scared because I had no history of how fast the drop-off would be on the last 25%. You know what I mean. I can drive 300 miles on 3/4 of a tank in my IC, and just 35 on the last quarter tank. It turned out to be a non-issue...happily.

So Avis: 1. Provide a charging adapter!!!! 2. Add a charge station map to your app, or a link to one that already exists. You'll remove a barrier to adoption and then you can charge more for a $40k vehicle than you do for a stripped-down $20k Kia Soul.",11-04-2024
"I test drove a bunch more EVs, my thoughts on the winners and losers (Part 2)[Given the unexpected popularity of my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1fygp10/test_drove_10_evs_at_a_local_event_my_thoughts_on/), and my hunt for EVs taking on more of a active role given a $2500 repair bill + the prospect of more in the summer for my wife's car, I've been taking more EVs out for a spin. I figured I'd share what I learned with the class, and hopefully someone else can benefit or just have fun reading about it

To answer some of the questions from the last post:

If a car isn't here, it's because I haven't driven it for whatever reason. As well, the EV landscape in Canada is pretty different from the EV landscape in the US. You guys seem to be getting incentive after incentive, and while it's *starting* to get better (no more \~4 year waitlist for an Ioniq 5!) we're probably where you were at \~1-2 years ago in terms of incentive. For example, the best lease deal I found on a non-stripper Ioniq 5 is around $1000 CAD/$720 USD. Likewise, while I'd love a $299 USD deal on an Equinox I see people posting about, best deal I got quoted from multiple dealers was \~$600 CAD/$420 USD

Most Surprising (Positive): Ford Mustang Mach-e

Most Surprising (Negative): Audi Q4

Best Value: Volkswagen ID.4 (among this crop, but overall is still the Tesla Model 3 LR RWD Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y standard range

Volkswagen ID.4: 5/10

This is the car version of vanilla ice cream. This is a car that uses energy to move wheels to get you places. This is a product you can purchase with money from selling your labour

There's nothing *wrong* with the ID.4. Both on paper and in real life, it is a competent driving object. It's just so fucking *bland*. There are certainly EVs who drive blandly, I've talked about them here. But usually they offer something to offset that; some sort of utility (the Lyriq/RZ and its comfort, the Equinox in its affordability), just... something.

This is the car version of the paper they wrap spring rolls in. Thin nothingness. Maybe that was fine when it was one of the few EVs you could actually go out and buy during the shortage, but now? It's competing in a segment (crossover SUV thing) and price point (roughly $50-65k CAD) that is INCREDIBLY crowded at the moment

Infotainment is solidly okay, not awful like I've heard, but this 2024 is apparently the ""fixed"" version. Driving is boring, no feedback. The car feels like its off and just kinda gliding places, but not in a smooth luxury way. I don't know how to describe it other than it feels like what I thought a robotaxi would be, but you're actually driving the damn thing. Sterile.

If you are someone who always drives a Volkswagen, and you need a new car, this isn't something that will ruin your life. But is that what you want out of a car?

Audi Q4: 4/10

This EV suffers from Blazer syndrome; if you're already spending the money, reach for a Q6. If you want the same package, just get the ID.4. Otherwise, I feel like you're spending a lot more money for what it ultimately the same product

For example, a top trim ID.4 and a base trim Q4 are about the same price ($63,231 and $63,400 CAD, respectively), and here's what you have to pay to gain feature parity:

\~$5000 to upgrade to the 55 quattro, to match the ID.4 Pro S' HP

\~$6000 premium package to match the ID.4's memory seats, among others

\~$5000 package to match the ID.4's adaptive cruise control

That's fucking nuts. Yes, the Q4 feels nicer inside. Yes, it handles better (marginally). Yes, if you pay even more, you can get certain features that the ID.4 doesn't have, like the VR Hud and the hands free cruise control, which are nice.

Also, the ID.4 has ventilated seats. You can't even option ventilated seats on the Q4! What's with the German OEMs and their hate for this feature?

But I feel like its nowhere near nice ENOUGH to justify spending that money on it. If you really want one, upgrade to the Q6, whose feature set and range and general build quality, from what I've read, seems to be a league better. And I know that ""just spend more money lol"" isn't necessarily fair, but option for option, if you're buying (or more likely, leasing) a new car that's in the \~$75,000 range anyway, I really don't think that jumping to the \~$85,000 range will trouble you, unless you can't really afford the $75k car anyway

Volvo EX30: 6/10

I'm not even mad; I'm just confused

To get this out of the way; I fucking LOVE this car. Once it hits the used market and we move to a place with enough driveway space for 2 EVs to overnight charge, this will be mine. I want it over the i4, and I fucking loved that car.

It's so fucking fun to drive. It feels very light on its feet, like you're zipping around. On the updated twin motors of \~400+ horsepower (!) it feels like you're in a need for speed game (even when you're obeying the speed limit!). It reminds me most of a Golf GLI and then a Golf R, or maybe a Mini Cooper. This is the EV Golf that Volkswagen should be making; a fun but practical family car, and then an absurdly hot hatch in the form of the twin motor. And all that fun was before I turned traction control off!

I'll also say that this is the smoothest implementation of regen braking I've had in a car. Absolutely peak, better than the previous winners of Tesla and BMW

The interior is very funky, in a way that activates my Spreadsheet brain. It's absolutely cost cutting, but honestly? It's still a nice place to be. At first I thought it'd feel way worse, because it had reverse Hyundai Effect (where their materials look nice but feel bad). The flecked plastic looked cheap, but when you're actually in it, it doesn't feel that bad.

The materials are certainly nowhere near as good as the S60 or XC60, but they still felt wayyy better than an average economy car. They look interesting, they feel interesting/pretty good. The seats remain incredible, even if not quite as good as their more expensive cousins

Like I said, everything feels like it was designed with purpose. Most buttons pull double duty, the screen is how you do everything, but the infotainment is snappy, and designed in a very logical way. No Menu hell like the EQE

But that's the issue; it's a cost cutting vehicle... for fucking *$57,000 CAD!* ($41,000 USD). That's fucking absurd. This is supposed to be their entry level car, and it's more expensive than their gas XC40. It's more expensive than a base model XC60! Which is far larger and nicer. This car could do extremely well in Canada; I see Golfs and mazda 3s rolling around all the time. Priced a bit less (but still more) and Volvo could sell it well. But they're not, and why? This car goes against their move to being luxury, but in this case, why make it?

And of course, I follow the Chinese market. This car is the less luxury version of its sister car, the Zeekr X! So don't give me any bullshit about ""oh we needed to cut costs : ("" [when the Zeekr X exists](https://www.datocms-assets.com/128969/1713875719-zeekrx_interior_main2_tab.jpg?auto=format), built in the same goddamn factory and sold for the same price in China (roughly $35,000 CAD).

To paraphrase a German: I say this full of admiration for the EX30. I love it, I love it very much. But I love it against my better judgement

I am probably the demographic it was made from. I'm a young white collar professional who works in a boring industry, I compared these with spreadsheets, I consider Chinese design to be a positive instead of a negative for an EV, and I have awful fashion sense. If I'm hesitant about it, how well is it going to sell for a random 50 year old crosshopping it with an XC40?

Ford Mustang Mach-e: 8/10

WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER. This is the car my wife settled for.

There's a lot to like here; this car handles quite well for an SUV. It's no sports car, it's no Mustang. But you know, everyone knows the arguments now, so I won't get into it other than to say I will only call it a mach e

Interior wise, the big ass tablet is kind of lame, but I feel like it's laid out in a logic fashion. It's response, it's fine, the wheel for volume makes a nice clicky sound when you use it, which pleases me. The turn signal noise sounds like horse hooves clicking. It satisfies my lizard brain. The materials aren't necessarily better than competition, but like the EX30, it's what you do with it that counts. They're laid out very nicely, everything feels and looks interesting, etc

Driving feel is very American. Not necessarily super feedbacky, but you definitely don't feel this thing's weight around corners. I mean again, it's an SUV at the end of the day. But you can tell that Ford was REALLY trying here

It also is nice that it doesn't make eco mode feel like a penalty box. Really, Ford, Kia-Hyundai, Tesla, and Volvo are an odd coalition that makes you think that eco mode is how they expect you to drive it, and make that mode as nice and reasonable as possible

So why not a 10/10? If this is what we're buying, and we both love it, why an 8?

Well, it's because we're buying one used. New? This car is simply not cost competitive. It is, for sure, a better car than the Equinox or Blazer from Chevrolet, or the Model Y from Tesla. It is simply not nearly $10,000 better

You can get any GM product for less, with more range. Oh, and they usually feel a bit bigger inside. Tesla is worse inside for the Y, but likewise you get native NACS, better range, and lower prices

Used, however? We're going to be picking up a 2021 Mach-e Premium extended range for $33,000 CAD sticker. That's more than 50% depreciation, for a vehicle with less than 30,000 kilometres on it. That's fucking NUTS, and good value

There are, theoretically, Mach-es that get in the same price, but the small battery is both short of range for not a big discount, and also unicorn tier rare. We can custom order one from the factory according to Ford, but one in the wild already made? Nah.

Chevrolet Silverado EV: 10/10

The letter to keep in mind for the Silverado EV is ""C""

The first C is for Cavernous: its a full sized truck, but this is by far one of the most spacious vehicles I've been in, ever. Almost felt like more space than an Escalade. It's about the same size as an ICE Silverado, but holy shit. I genuinely felt like a kid who had climbed into his dad's truck. In the backseat, I felt like I was in a movie theatre

The second C is for Cheap. I sat in the work truck (base) model and actually drove the fully loaded one; night and fucking day. I swear there's a prototype WT trim out there with hand cranked windows. The smell of plastic was nausiated, and it was covered in what was genuinely one of the worst feeling fake leathers I've had the misfortunate of sitting in. Hard plastic galore

So yeah, this is a truck that's basically required to be purchased above base trim. Hell, if I was in the jury for a trial of a workman who beat his boss' ass for buying this for him, I would find him not guilty regardless of evidence

But otherwise... as someone who likes sedans, I felt dread driving this, because it was awesome. This is a Truck without *any* of the traditional downsides of owning a truck. Still body on frame, so it wasn't like it was perfect, but it felt far nicer than any truck I've driven before (besides the lightning). It felt peppy, and didn't feel like I was dragging a full sized truck around. It felt far more like an SUV than a truck

Likewise, cost of fuel; napkin math says that I should be able to get \~773 kilometres with the top trim gas engine (which, according to C&D, is actually more efficient than the 4 cyl, common 4 banger L). That needs premium fuel, so for the 90 litre tank at $1.85 a litre of 93, is \~$166, or 22 cents a kilometre

Compare that to the RST, with \~708 kilometres of range from a battery that appears to be 205 kwh. At my overnight rate of $0.08 a kwh, I'd cost me $16.40 to charge, for a cost of 2.3 cents a kilometre

But there is a range, of course. Assuming you charge from zero to full at an average Tesla charger, you're going to pay $98.40 for a full ""tank"". Still cheaper, but less so

But then my province also offers a super low overnight rate of $0.023 kwh, knocking the Silverado down to being recharged for $5.74. For two coffees at tims, you can get 708 kilometres of range. Insane

All that being said, I expect trucks to SIGNIFICANTLY increase in popularity as time goes on

Lexus RZ: 7/10

I'll probably get some flack for this, given that this and the Bzwhatever is the most hated car other than the cybertruck, but I thought that this was a pretty decent car

It feels like a Lexus, Electric. If you like Lexus, then you will like this car. Given the talk about it, I actually though the specs would be far worse. But the one I drove got an EPA range of \~430 kilometres, with a max charging speed of 147 kws

And you know what? That's *fine.* Would I buy this car? Not right now, because it'll be used on regular \~550 kilometre roadtrips, but if I didn't? Very strong contender

It felt very nice inside, probably among the most comfortable after the various Volvos. Infotainment was solidly okay, nothing to write home about. It felt a bit slow on the highway, but like, who cares?

This is a car for people who are 50-80 years old, who have always bought Japanese, who want something nice in their golden years, who will go on a roadtrip of maybe 300 kilometres to get on a plane to get sunburnt at an all inclusive in Barbados. Essentially, this is a car made in a lab for My Father. So thank you Lexus!",11-04-2024
"The Toyota bZ4X was the best-selling car in Norway for OctoberA translated press release from Norway's Road Traffic Information Council (OFV) has included a pretty surprising detail:

"Tesla Model Y vs. Chevy Equinox EV (the family car buyer‚Äôs perspective)After much deliberation about which would be better for my small family I think we have a winner, the Chevy Equinox EV. Let me explain.

So to be exact a 2025 Chevy Equinox EV LT FWD vs a 2020 Tesla Model Y LR. The two cars I was choosing from were on the shortlist because they are the exact same price $31,000. The Chevy is new and the Tesla is used with 38,000 miles on it. 

For reference I have owned EVs for 8 years and my first EV was a 2016 Chevy Bolt. I loved that car. The only real problem was the charge speed was nowhere near where I needed it to be for long distance trips, which my family does often. I have also owned a 2021 Tesla Model 3 LR for 3 years and that car really spoiled me with its handling, acceleration, and the supercharging network is really special but it is to small for our family car. I never thought I‚Äôd buy anything other than a Tesla again but opening up the supercharging network up to non-Teslas has really got me thinking.

I test drove both of these cars and it‚Äôs pretty night and day as far as performance goes. The Model Y even has the acceleration boost upgrade. Not to say the Equinox EV wasn‚Äôt a smooth ride but it feels slow and heavy compared to a Model Y. The Model Y also felt like it had a bit more space in the trunk and more headroom. It‚Äôs a bit easier to take a car seat out also. So you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúwhat gives? Why did you decide on an Equinox EV?‚Äù A few big reasons. The first is that the Equinox was more comfortable. The seats felt better, the suspension was softer, and the infotainment was better in my opinion (something I thought I‚Äôd never say about a non-tesla) 

All in all we decided on a new car with full warranty and no wear. It was really close though and honestly in the near future I would love a Model Y or 3 as a commuter car. ",11-04-2024

"Battery energy density should only attain 350 Wh/kg to have 600 miles EV with same weight of an ICE carMany people think an EV battery should achieve 13,000 Wh/kg to achieve the same range of a combustion car with the same range. But in reality EV batteries should have 350 Wh/kg pack level energy density attain 600 miles with the same weight.

I did the calculations. 

Take Tesla model 3(SR) for the EV and Toyota Camry TRD for the combustion car.

Camry's curb weight= 1620 kg

Model 3's curb weight = 1628 kg

Model 3's weight without it's battery= 1,172 kg

Tesla model 3 fuel economy= 4 miles/kWh

Energy needed for 600 miles= 150 kWh

Maximum battery weight model 3 
can have to attain the same curb weight= 1620-1172 kg = 448 kg

Battery's energy density= 150,000 Wh/ 448 kg= 334.82 Wh/kg.

"Just saw a review video of the original Tesla Roadster, and EVs used to be excitingRecently I saw a review video of the original Tesla Roadster, and it was an exciting car. It got almost 250 miles of range, and it was a first gen EV. Tesla also used a normal car interior for that car, not the all touch screen garbage that they use now. It was also one of the only sports car EVs ever released. Nowadays, even on the legacy auto makers side of thing, all that's coming out is copy and paste SUVs, and most of them use a Tesla style interior without buttons for things like HVAC. Oddly enough even though touch screens are supposed to save auto makers money, lower end EVs are more likely to have normal car interiors. For me anytime I see a car without buttons for things like AC, it instantly kills my excitement for it. I also don't like how we see almost no new EV sedans coming out, just big SUVs",11-02-2024

"How did the likes of Fisker go bankrupt but not VinFast?First off, I have no skin in the game for neither of these two brands. 

I like EVs and wish for them to succeed in general. 

That being said, the generalized version of my impression with these two brands are:

1. Almost everyone in Fisker subreddit saying they wouldn‚Äôt go bankrupt, then they do. 

2. Almost everyone in VinFast subreddit saying they will go bankrupt, but haven‚Äôt (or maybe not yet?). 

Before Fisker filed for bankruptcy they had a pretty ironclad fanbase. Almost propaganda-like. Dissent was basically asking to get sent to the gulag.

VinFast on the other hand, had a plethora of skeptics and continues to have them. I see them around more often now both in the SF Bay Area and OC (not nearly as much as Teslas though obviously).

\- 5-10 years from now the battery technology we are using today will look comically antiquated, in the same way that the range and technology of a 2014 Nissan Leaf compared to the average EV being produced today looks abysmal.  
  
\- Chinese vehicles will take over the market, offering both competitive quality and price. The tariffs slow them down, but Chinese manufacturers like BYD will set up bigger factories in Canada and Mexico and other parts of the world to bypass tariffs. Certain unique niche American brands will still be around, like Tesla or Rivian, but the average American automaker, GM, Ford, Stellantis, etc. will really struggle to stay afloat. Korean and Japanese manufacturers stay afloat, but will never gain the kind of market Chinese will. Hyundai and Kia maintain a niche following interested in off-the-beaten-path designs. 

\- FSD will be a reality in most big cities across North America and Europe. Waymo and Cybercab will become the biggest competitors to Uber, and people will increasingly opt for the experience of having no drivers compared to having a driver. 

\- ICE vehicles will continue to be around but will become substantially cheaper in price in most places. Most manufacturers offering new ICE vehicles will make hybrid standard across the line on all their vehicles. 

\- Toyota will announce that they believe hydrogen will be the future.

"Why Australia will be the true test of whether consumers really want EVsA recent article [(link](https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/top-10-cheapest-evs-in-australia-and-none-of-them-are-teslas)) about the cheapest EVs to buy in Australia has me thinking about how the Australian car market will be the first true test of whether consumers really want EVs when they're available on a level playing field with ICE vehicles.

Australia has a free trade agreement with China, resulting in an avalanche of Chinese manufacturers entering the market in recent years.

EVs are now at price parity (or cheaper) than ICE vehicles. For example:

* The MG4 is $31,000 (AUD) versus $36,000 for the cheapest Corolla.
* The BYD Seal is $50,000 versus $47,500 for an equivalent Camry (noting the BYD is much more upmarket).

Australia should be a great market for EVs - it's one of the most urbanised / urban-centric populations in the world. Although it's massive country, the vast majority of people are not undertaking long journeys on a regular basis an urban areas are concentrated in specific locations.

Most western countries do not have the benefit of cheaper EVs in the same way Australia has, so it's difficult to know whether low-EV take up in those countries is because of the lack of competitive EV options. E.g. America and Europe with high tarrifs for Chinese EVs and other trade barriers. I.e. there's not free competition between ICE and EVs.

Alternatively, countries which do have high EV sales, notably China and Norway, have only achieved this by making EVs significantly more attractive than ICE vehicles through subsidies, taxation, and other benefits. I.e., again, there's not free competition between ICE and EVs.

Therefore, it looks like Australia is one of the few (or only?) large wealthy countries where we can observe whether consumers prefer EVs over ICE when there's a level playing field. It'll be fascinating to see what happens over the coming years.",10-25-2024
"Electric trucks probably won't be as low to operate as they're currently made out to be, primarily because of needing to DC fast charge repeatedly.TLDR; Electric trucks need commitment from manufacturers or utilities to provide access to below $0.30/kWh level 3/4 fast charging for trucks to keep them competitive with diesel. 


Average DC fast charge price can be between $0.4-0.6/kWh.

https://stable.auto/insights/electric-vehicle-charger-price-by-state

An electric truck that does average runs of anything greater than 100-150 miles, will have to DC fast charge, and it's ratio of DC fast charge to Lvl2 charging will probably end up being 1:1 or 1.8:1

Now, for electric cars, the real savings is obtained from home charging and needing no maintenance.

Electric trucks, for one-way trip distances greater than 150 miles will probably not be as much as they're made out to be on operating costs.

This is because, no charging provider or truck stop company like Love's or electric truck manufacturer has come up with a plan to provide DC fast charging at rates below $0.25/kWh.

In DHL's post about Tesla semi, they achieved 1.72kWh/mile, carrying 34 tons.

60¬¢ - $516

A very efficient diesel truck will go above 8mpg. As of October 21st, 2024, average price of diesel across the US is $3.553/gallon.

62.5, rounded up to 65 gallons of fuel needed. That's about $230 at current diesel prices. Say $250 including DEF.

To be competitive with diesel, the electricity price needs to be lower than $0.30/kWh

Now, to be sure, yes there are prices for DCFC that are lower than 30 cents. But there's way more points with prices higher, rather than lower than that threshold.

Along with electric trucks, even if they're for trips lower than 400/500 mi, utilities, manufacturers or third party charging providers will need to come up with fast charging rates competitive with diesel.

The only thing I see where electric trucks to be really competitive with diesel, is trip within 100ish miles, where the truck returns to depot after completing the day, and then plugs into depot level fast charging of 100kW (remember even at 100kW, a 400/500 mile battery of 800-900kWh) needs almost 10 hours to charge to full.",10-25-2024
"Went to CarMax to buy an ICE for our second car, drove off in a Tesla M3. All ICEs seemed from a different era. What am I missing?My wife and I own a Model S for years, and recently we decided to buy a second car (used). We were thinking ICE because (a) it's a bit cheaper, (b) we can use it for longer trips without the charging stops, (c) later if our oldest goes to a college without EV charging support, he can take the ICE car with him.

We test drove a few, all nice ICEs (budget: $20K-$30K). CarMax also had a 2021 Tesla M3 for just shy of $30K that we thought to also try. As soon as we set out to drive, it became obvious to my wife, my kid, and myself that the technology in the Tesla was overwhelmingly superior to all ICEs we tried. It was as through some sci-fi thing a car from the future was sneaked onto the lot that we could try.

Yet there's a lot of anti-Tesla and anti-EV sentiment going around. Including of course many reddit forums. Even the young CarMax salesman took the opportunity to recommend a Mazda over the Tesla because ""first off I don't like electric cars, I wouldn't drive one... then, Japanese cars are very reliable and get you good mileage"". I told him I appreciate the thought but we'll get the Tesla nevertheless. As he was going through the steps of showing me what CarMax extended warranty (which had zero customization for EVs) can offer me, I pointed out that an EV doesn't even have most of the covered parts and subsystems. The irony was lost on him.

"Value Prop of Used ‚Äò24 Genesis Electrified G80
I wanted a highway commuter. 60-70 mi round trip. Would be third vehicle. I wanted an understated luxury, comfortable, EV sedan that would eat up highway miles. Only looked at sedans as wife and I both have SUVs. Cross shopped tesla model 3 highland, polestar 2, BMW i4/i5. Also consider used model S or lucid lease. No polestar or lucid space close to me was a con for those. I also have a good Genesis dealership which made the decision easier. 

While doing research on EV sedans prior to purchase, I felt like there was not a lot of info about the electrified G80. I haven‚Äôt seen many on the roads, but the ICE G80 has become quite popular and the C&D reviews are so positive for both. IMO this car is not worth its list price new. However, there are < 1 year old vehicles with $20-30k discounts, which is how I wound up in one. I wound up purchasing my 2024 Genesis eG80 used after about 8 months of corporate use for around $52k OTD. And I think for that price, this car is an absolute STEAL. 

Battery: 
- 87.2 kWh battery with 800V architecture
- 3.4-3.6 mi/kWh doing 70 mi round trip highway commute, 70-75mph
- Range is good, not great. ~260 miles at 80%. 
- Level 2 charging at home is necessary (not specific to this car of course)
- Genesis coming out with NACS adapter in a few months. 

Exterior:
- Quiet luxury. Not many people know the brand and doesn‚Äôt standout like the Germans.
- Cargo space not great. This is a highway utility barge for me, so I don‚Äôt care about cargo. But it generally is insufficient for its size if using for family. The trunk got eaten away by the battery. No frunk. But can still handle big Costco runs without issue. 
- Between wheelbase and clearance, I get in and out of my steep driveway (~17 degrees measured with iPhone) without scraping. 

Interior: 
- I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù and have plenty of headroom. Everyone bitching about the floor being raised for the battery? Go sit in one and see how it fits your body type. But this is a non-issue unless your 6‚Äô2‚Äù+. Rear seats feel tighter. But again, non-issue for me. 
- Customizable seats. Heated/cooled. Massaging is present, not that impressive though. 
- Dedicated climate control buttons (mix of mechanical and Haptic Touch). But don‚Äôt need to access OS to change temp.
- Seating position and visibility is good. Coming from my 4Runner it‚Äôs worse, but tradeoff for sedan I think. 
- Wireless Apple CarPlay. Genesis map/nav sucksssss. So this was a necessary OTA update. 
- Finicky phone charger
- Stereo is good. Highs are good, lacks some bass. 

Driving: 
- Very quiet at highway speeds
- Holy torque. 516 lb ft this thing pulls.
- Sport mode tightens up suspension and seat bolsters, with 365 HP it‚Äôs quick as hell. It‚Äôs not a sports car though. Don‚Äôt understand why so many people care about 0-60 and track times in general. Huge pet peeve when reviewers make it a con. 
- RWD biased AWD system is nice 
- Excellent autopilot. Adaptive cruise is customizable, smart, and conservative. I have no issues transitioning in and out of heavy traffic. Can set at low speeds in traffic which is brilliant. 
- Regen breaking is customizable and is a comfortable transition from ICE. 
- The multi link suspension is extremely comfortable. The Car Care Nut called it ‚Äúcrashy?‚Äù I feel like I‚Äôm driving on memory foam. If you want a tight race car this isn‚Äôt for you. 

Overall the cons of this car (namely headroom and cargo space) just weren‚Äôt big issues for me at all. Yeah it‚Äôs a retrofit like the i4, but that‚Äôs what I like about it. For $50-60k this car is a no-brainer compared to others competing in its segment. But farrrrr more luxury bits than the Tesla, polestar or even the Germans.

"Road trips seem a lot less stressful in ICE vs my EV6Before I get buried in downvotes and accusations of being an EV hater, I just want to say that I do really love my Kia EV6 for local driving.  The ride quality is great and the handling characteristics of EVs make it extremely enjoyable to drive around compared to ICE vehicles.  I also am very happy with it for relatively short road trips where I can charge at my destination and where I'll only need to stop once on the way, since planning alternative charging stops in that scenario is not too difficult.  This is my US-specific opinion based on living and travelling in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic US, so things may be better or worse in other countries or areas.

That said, I just did a 1300 mile (roundtrip) road trip and I have to say I'm glad that I chose to take my ICE vehicle (Subaru Legacy) instead of my EV6.  In retrospect, the trip would have been so much more stressful in my EV6 especially with the tight schedule I had.  There are three main things that I think would have made my EV6 a more stressful choice:

**1) Lack of reliable 175kW+ charger availability.**

Relative to most other EVs, the EV6 and other eGMP vehicles are capable of faster charging, and this was a huge part of the reason I got this car.  However, only a fraction of deployed DCFC stalls can actually take full advantage of this.  My EV6 can hold 230kW+ speeds for a huge chunk of the charging curve.  After perusing PlugShare, I discovered that the only places on my route that consistently had any 175kW+ chargers were the Electrify America, Pilot/Flying J, Circle K, and (weirdly) Ford dealerships.  Most of the other ""fast"" chargers were 125kW or below, often 62.5kW or 50kW.  When I'm doing a long drive in one day, I really don't like stopping for longer than it takes me to use the bathroom and grab a snack - 10-15 minutes at most.  I don't want to be stuck at a slow ""fast"" charger for longer than I need to be.  Virtually every gas station offers both 87 and 91-93 Octane gas, so I believe that every DCFC should offer at least one actually fast charger.

This won't be fixed by the Tesla network opening either, because superchargers can't do 800V which means they provide comparatively slow charging speeds to 800V eGMP vehicles.  V4 superchargers capable of 800V+ are currently vaporware since zero of them have been deployed as of today.  Having to spot-check the PlugShare reviews for each DCFC site before stopping there to avoid ending up at a ""dud"" is also pretty annoying.  I've experienced having a gas pump fail to work correctly a total of two times in my entire life.  In the 5 months I've had the EV6, I've had a charging failure due to a dispenser issue happen over a dozen times at various DCFC stations.  I realize it's a lot more complicated, but they (DCFC site and network operators) will need to do a much better job with reliability if they want people to switch to EVs.

**2) Excessive number of stops.**

At the 75-80mph speeds and 55-65F temperature that nearly all of my travel took place at, my EV6 manages 3mi/kWh (and that's if I'm being optimistic).  Since charging above 80% is slow and dropping below 10% is risky given the sparse infrastructure, only about 70% of my battery capacity is usable on a road trip (compared to 90%+ of the average gas tank).  That's roughly 160mi of usable range between stops, compared to 500+ in my Subaru.  I would have had to stop every 2 hours (likely even more frequently depending how distant the next charger was).  Additionally, many of the possible EV charging stops along my route (EA and dealerships in particular) were not really located somewhere desirable where there's easy access to bathrooms and snacks.  I understand some people might like to stop and stretch every 1.5 to 2 hours, but that's not me.  I want the drive to be over with as fast as possible and stopping makes it take longer.

**3) High DCFC prices relative to gasoline.** 

The Subaru cost between 8.8-9.7 cents per mile to drive on the highway (gas prices ranging $2.90-$3.20/gal at 33mpg), while the EV6 would have cost between 15.0-22.7 cents per mile due to the hugely variable yet consistently expensive cost of DCFC ($0.45-$0.68/kWh after sales tax at 3mi/kWh).  Even if I fully charged at home before leaving, this trip in my EV6 would have cost me almost double the cost of gas.  Gas prices were a lot less variable and did not have sales tax on top of them.  Additionally, it's way easier to compare gas prices as I don't need to go into a bunch of different apps to find the prices, I can just use one app for that.  If I want to know the price of an EA charger, I have to open the EA app.  If I want to know the price of an EVgo charger, I have to open the EVgo app.  This is a crappy experience.

At my destination there were limited options for hotels with L2 chargers.  The single hotel that did have EV charging costed $30 more per night which negated nearly all of the potential DCFC savings.  I booked that one anyway since at the time I wasn't decided on whether I was going to take the EV6 or not.  That hotel had 2 EV chargers - 1 Clipper Creek and 1 Tesla.  The Clipper Creek had a fault light on (which I expected after reading the PlugShare reviews), and the Tesla charger was in use the whole time so I wouldn't have been able to charge anyway.

**Final notes**

I do realize a lot of these issues are not as bad or may not even exist if you drive a Tesla.  I have seen that the Tesla nav does a great job minimizing unnecessary stops.  Tesla seems to also haves better efficiency and range than many comparable EVs so you can go farther between stops.  And finally, Supercharger charging cost for Tesla drivers are generally a lot more reasonable than DCFC costs for non-Tesla owners.  In my city it's 33 cents vs 56 cents.  Huge difference.  Only thing I don't like about the Teslas is the comparatively long 10-80% charging time vs my EV6.

Problem 1 will hopefully be solved if/when more gas station chains get into EV charging, so long as they don't put in ""slow"" fast chargers.  Problem 2 is solved with EVs that have larger/denser batteries and better efficiency (there are already substantially longer-range EVs that charge very quickly available on the market today, they are just prohibitively expensive for me).  Problem 3 I don't see being solved any time soon unless the government mandates open API access for live charging station data or something so that someone can make a single app to easily compare cost, which would help force stations to be more competitive with their pricing.

**TL;DR:**  America's DCFC infrastructure is still very sparse, unreliable, and expensive compared to gasoline.  Only a fraction of DCFC sites offer the high charging speeds supported by eGMP and many other 800V EVs.  Usable EV ""road trip"" range can be <60% of the advertised range due to lower efficiency at highway traffic speeds and due to only being able to effectively use the battery capacity that exists between 10% and 80%.",10-21-2024
"Why do plug-in hybrids feel so underwhelming?I drive a Tesla Model 3. I always said that after this car, I wouldn't go back to an ICE. However, I've recently come around a bit, and, am tempted by some of the plug-in hybrids on the market. However, I find the range completely underwhelming. It seems like all of them have ranges around 20-40 miles on the battery before needing to use the engine.

Like my Tesla, full EVs often get 200-400 miles of range. Why aren't there more hybrids that bridge the gap between these two? I'd be way more interested in a hybrid if it had an electric range of 100-150 miles.

Is it a design limitation? Like, does the presence of an ICE take up so much space that they can't fit a larger battery in for the electric motor? Is it something we'll see much improvement on in the future, or is a design choice?",10-21-2024

"EV Rental in Spain  1X1 BMWRented a mid-level BMW 1X1 in Barcelona Spain for two days for drive to small town 150km away.

The cars range is about 250 miles at 100% derating the WLPT rating to EPA.  Still hot in Spain so AC all the way.

The IX1 is a great car.  It had heads up display.  Its great when integrated with NAV and cruise control and has  become a must have feature.  Quiet, comfortable.   Regular car acceleration but that will help with range.

Charging in Spain turned out to be excellent.  Every large gas station had a couple chargers.    Typically just 50kW.  Might take extra time but that's about it.   Availability is all important. Even at 6AM I was able to get one to work from scratch, using the QR to get the app and using that for topping off for the trip after using the car the previous day.   That was the only time I needed on the road fast charging.  The town had two free L2 charges and plugged into one for the day. The Tesla S on the other charger was there when I got there and there when I left five hours later.

Parking garage in center of Barcelona had 20 chargers.  8 were just for Sixt, the car rental company, the others for the public.  When we were in the garage, always some public chargers available.  Parking garage for the car two blocks from our apartment had 2 x L2 which we used two nights.  That was super convenient having 100% charge.

Tesla chargers were available but we never got to try them out.  I have a Model 3 so ""Add your EV"" in the Tesla app was easy and it hten provide directions, maps, availability to use them.

The BMW nav app had a ""Go to charger feature"" which was good. It also had a nice feature of ""Start Preconditioning"" so could turn that on so you could charge faster.

Overall, renting an EV in Spain was easy with enough chargers to quell any range anxiety.",10-21-2024
I wonder if it is possible to retrofit Tesla V3 superchargers with longer cordsIdeally when they are repaired for example.,10-21-2024
"A week with a Polestar as a Tesla ownerHertz had a good special on a Polestar down in central Florida so I rented one for the week. I've been a Tesla Model 3 owner since December 2023. 

There were some things I really liked about the Polestar (either a 2 or 4, not the SUV) and I could see it's market share growing, but I also felt some of it's limitations.

What I liked:

The in-car entertainment system being built on Google excelled compared to Tesla. Having access to google maps was a dream, and it integrated with the car's battery so I could see charging stations and battery status. 

The trunk had a spacious opening, so a device like a walker could easily be stored in the trunk, something I can't do with a model 3 due to the shape of the trunk. 

The ability to install apps opens up a huge potential for software development.

The car drove well, had a good feel to it and was overall fun to drive. 

I felt like the car was a bit higher off the road than the Tesla Model 3 is. This was nice for older riders, and I liked the grab bars, which my Tesla lacks. 

Things I didn't like: 

The most annoying thing. I had to manually select Bluetooth audio every time I began a drive. Why can't it remember? 

No Phone Control for rentals. To do this, you need both keys in the car, and Hertz keeps one of the keys. Tesla has a rental car mode that you can control a rental with your phone, so this would be nice. 

It either doesn't have adaptive cruise control or I couldn't get it to work, also missed my built in dash cam and 360cams. 

Some of the controls felt clunky, especially related to the HVAC system. 

No dog mode, it's useful for more than just dogs. 

And then the whole mess of CCS charging. Worrying about if chargers will be broke, only like one or two Tesla chargers in central Florida have the built in Magic Dock, and the prices for chargers like electrify America. Holy crap. I paid $50 for 2 CCS chargers. I'd pay half that in my Tesla. On one of my trips I drove like an extra 45 minutes to get to a CCS charger, passing a Tesla station. 

If Hertz runs the special again, I'd rent it, but I wouldn't buy it. ",10-21-2024
"Drove my cousins Chevy Blazer last week. Idk if it's some settings but doesn't feel like an EVFirst off it feels bulky and so feels almost as of the whole body lags behind the car. Second, the regen braking was almost not noticable and I had to use the brakes... A lot. 
The interior feels premium compared to Tesla's, and Google native integration is a big plus but ride quality and comfort was nowhere as good as Teslas's. 

I can't appreciate the Google maps integration enough but otherwise too much screen real estate was wasted on gimmicky e dials and way too many buttons.",10-21-2024

"An honest rental experience with range anxiety and a Volvo C40Recent Budget ""Standard Elite Electric"" rental at Indianapolis airport, for a trip that took me to the southern tip of Illinois. The trip itself was 239 miles one way, I needed to do a round trip in 2 days. I had done Model Y's in the past, but I'm a bit anti-Elon at the moment and wanted to explore what else there was. 

TLDR: C40 Range bad, interior and tech a mixed bag, Budget maintenance has issues, won't buy but solved my fears of range anxiety for a long trip. 

I had rented on the budget app with the thought I was getting a ""Mustang Mach-E or similar,"" I had used A Better Route Planner ahead of time to map out a halfway point, Effingham Il, for where to charge if needed and though 2 charges would be all I'd need, based on known range. When I landed and saw the Volvo C40, my heart somewhat sank. 

The range on the Volvo isn't great, but came from Budget charged to 100%. 

The cruise control was confusing (didn't learn about the long-press-1-mph-increment for cruise control til after day 1 with the rental). The budget rental also had a ""Coolant issue- service needed"" warning as soon as I got it that was interesting, but never impacted my rental. Around 3 hours into the drive I got a tire pressure warning, I hated that the sensor didn't show me a reading, because the free air spot I found at a charge station relied on you taking a reading after air was pumped into the tire... so I needed to detour to a walmart for a 97c tire pressure reader I promptly left at the air pump for anyone else who may need it. ""Storing"" pressure was also different. I went through the whole manual in the console trying to find tire issues, and I can say that manual is no replacement for a good printed one....

My first stop to Effingham I parked and charged at an E.A. fast charger using CCS1. Took about 40 mins to go from 20% to 90%, got dinner while I waited. 

The next charge was at a Tesla supercharger when I arrived in Marion, Il. again from about 20% to 90%, but I had to google about how to use the magic dock and DL the Tesla App. After that, though, flawless and I preferred my Tesla Charger experience to E.A. 

Drive dynamics were great, loved the acceleration. View out the back stunk, but the 360 camera was nice too. Going down I used Carplay, which I liked, but coming back I used built-in Google maps, which showed range and predicted battery and wound up becoming my preferred nav style. 

I hated the steering wheel capacitive sensor, kept not registering my hands and would need a jiggle for the adaptive cruise control and lane control. 

My other major gripe, interior lighting. The main overhead didn't automatically turn on (couldn't find settings for it either) when the door was opened... I hated that. I also hated how it was illuminated at night while driving- let me dim it for pete's sake!

Overall, something with only predicted 190 miles highway made me nervous, especially when in the middle of nowhere IL to IN. Still, I did it, even with a detour off I-70. The C40 isn't for me, but It wasn't bad, and I think with a larger battery a XC40 or Polestar is something I'd be ok with, the weird tapered end of the C40 though (and lack of rear view) kinda turned me off.",10-20-2024
"Tesla battery health at 92% after 2 yearsHello everyone, wanted to inquire, if battery degradation is higher than expected. 

I have a Euro spec (Belgium) Tesla Model Y 2022. Assembled in China. Charging habits: 99% at home. Charge limited to 80%. Charge every 3-4 days. 

Regen set to max. Use DCFC about once every 3-4 month. Not very often. Charged to 100% in 2 years of ownership maybe 3 times. 

I might put it on climate, where I live it is 35-40*C (95-104F) in summer and about -20*C (-4F) in winter. 

Do you notice similar ~4% degradation annually? 

Edit: Apologies for confusion. I do in fact have a Long Range Model Y 2022 with dual motors and NMC batteries, if not mistaken LG.",10-20-2024
"How is it living with an EV as an apartment dweller Hey y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm looking into getting a new car soon and I have narrowed it down to 2 cars that I want. I‚Äôm looking at a used Polestar 2 or a used Genesis G70. My current dilemma is that I live in an apartment complex and I plan on doing so for the foreseeable future. With this in mind, I am aware that I would have to rely on public chargers and in my experience. The NACS (Tesla) chargers have proven to be the most reliable. My main question is for non-Tesla EV owners, how do y‚Äôall manage on public chargers, how expensive is it ( I know it varies depending on location), would you recommend it or not and why? Keep in mind I drive almost every single day which means I would have to charge at least once a week. Thank you very much!",10-20-2024
Sony Honda Mobility Adopts North American Charging Standard (NACS) for AFEELA EVs in the U.S. and Japan ‚Äì First non-Tesla vehicle for Japan market,10-20-2024

"New US and Canadian CCS chargers in September 2024**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in September 2024,**¬†according to the Department of Energy. You can¬†[get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in¬†r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""**¬†e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 167 CCS charging stations with a total of 444 chargepoints added or refreshed in September 2024.**¬†For comparison, there were 224 new CCS charging stations in September 2023, with 431 chargepoints. This was a slow month.

Some of these stations are Tesla Magic Dock stations. That makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:**¬†most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using PlugShare and the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

Tesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then there has clearly been a delay in the rollout. Ford, Rivian and GM owners can now order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle.

However, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only¬†*some*¬†CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, including locations that work with certain non-Tesla vehicles.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can¬†[sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

"Which to drive on short solo road trip?  We have two EVs.  One Tesla model Y‚Ä¶ needs to
Charge twice to arrive.  The other one only once.  The other one has free charging along the route. Tesla does not.  The Tesla we own the other we lease and we know we will owe $$ at the end for over mileage which is okay bc it comes out almost even to paying mileage on advance.  

Charging at the destination is fine for Tesla and crap for the other right now.  No real high speed options at the moment.  I believe Tesla is adding magic dock stations as we speak and a new High speed CCS is under construction too!  Hotel has charging if it works.  J1772.  The other EV doesn‚Äôt have access yet to Tesla network.  So which one would you drive?  ",10-17-2024
Tesla disabling MagicDock?,10-16-2024
"EVs vibrate at high speedsGoing to keep this general because of how widespread the problem is (no matter the brand). On positive side, for me there‚Äôs no argument‚ÄîEVs are, by most parameters, a better option than ICE cars.  At low speeds, they are rock solid, with quiet and smooth rides. However, as these cars approach higher speeds‚Äîaround 75 mph (120 km/h)‚Äîthings start to get shaky.

I've been testing EVs extensively for the past six months and have over a year of experience with my Cupra Born. One issue I've consistently found is that at high motorway speeds, the steering wheel vibrates. It's not just my Cupra Born‚Äîevery EV I‚Äôve tested, from the Tesla Model 3 to the BYD Seal (two with most pronounced problem), BMW i4, and even more budget-friendly models like the MG4, have the same issue. Research shows that I‚Äôm far from alone. There are countless reports of this problem across various EV models, whether it‚Äôs the M3, i4, Kia EV9, Ioniqs, ID4 and ID7‚Ä¶ This list is much longer in reality and the number of affected users very high.

These are low-amplitude, medium-intensity, high-frequency vibrations that are difficult to capture on camera but the sensation is there and they certainly aren‚Äôt pleasant after 1/2  hour or more of highway driving. The problem seems most pronounced in cars with stiffer, sportier suspensions‚Äîvehicles like the Tesla Model 3 and BYD Seal are by far the worst offenders. And while a softer suspension might reduce the sensation, it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the vibrations.

And before anyone chalks this up to typical issues like lane keeping systems, road surface, tire runout, flat spots, or unbalanced wheels, let me assure you, it‚Äôs not the same thing. It is funny how all the EVs with this problem now have unbalanced wheels and flat spots on the tires all of the sudden according to the dealers and uneducated users while in reality it is linked to the design of electric drive units. Rebalancing and tyre swaps never solve the problem but of course it can remedy it to certain degree.

Interestingly, many people are completely oblivious to the issue.  Mostly it‚Äôs because they rarely drive at highway speeds, or they can‚Äôt even reach those speeds due traffic congestions / speed permits in their country. Some may simply not be sensitive enough to notice it, and then there are others who seem willing to accept the flaw because of their commitment to the EVs, perhaps not even recognizing it as an issue. But the problem is real, and it‚Äôs amazing that the industry isn‚Äôt actively trying to solve it.

Don‚Äôt believe me? Go to your local Tesla center, test drive a Tesla Model 3 at high speed, and then immediately after, compare it to any ICE vehicle. It doesn‚Äôt even matter which one‚Äîyou‚Äôll spot the difference easily and you can do thousands of tire balancing in between.

So, what‚Äôs the solution? Should EVs have a second gear to help mitigate these vibrations? Could extreme dampening around the motors be the answer or should there be a major redesign of the units to lower the intensity of vibrations?

I realize this is an echo chamber, and I‚Äôm probably going to be downvoted hard, but this doesn‚Äôt change the vast numbers of suffers from this. And when a major publication finally talks about this problem, you can remember this post. 

This problem is a very common theme. Sadly a lot of people ignore and negate it with lies about rebalancing solutions but this will not make EVs better in long run.

"This is my Chinese commuter, is it any different from overseasMy daily commuter is called the BYD Seagull.



I bought the Seagull because the gasoline car is too much fuel consumption in the city commute, always in 10-11 oil, so I want to buy a trolley for transportation. I was going to get a Tesla, but the price wasn't right, and after a test drive the Seagull was the strongest overall for under $10k so I went with the Seagull.



The front seat model is not uncomfortable, the disadvantage is that the knees of people with long legs will be on top of the center air vent position. Rear row is the most unexpected, so small car rear space can be comparable to a class car, although it is a two-seater but sitting is also comfortable.



Currently 3000km mileage, total charging cost:23.05, mainly running highway charging fast charging, 0.25/degree power, and the rest of the time are in the workplace for free slow charging. Compared to the gasoline car, the 3000km, saving about 257.



I am most satisfied with the intelligent: cell phone app is better to use, directly see the vehicle status, power, power consumption, vehicle location, remote control, remote air conditioning, etc., 10,000 cars, this aspect is very satisfied. Special point is the cell phone binding NFC key, now don't need to take the key, a cell phone is done, very convenient, around many friends are also surprised, so a small car, but also quite advanced.

"I've been out of the loop for the last year or so. What are the big stories of 2024 in the EV world that I missed?I know the Cybertruck came out, and it's been met with mixed reviews. But are the really bad things just FUD, or is there truth to be gleaned from the negative articles about rust and leaks some friends have sent me?

Have the Japanese carmakers not named Nissan made a decent EV yet? Last I heard the Busy Forks had whompy wheels, and Handa's only offering had laughable range.

I'm hearing good things about the Model 3 refresh, since the one source of EV news I kept up with was Out of Spec's reviews channel. Have any other new EVs been making a similar splash?

I'm seeing tons more Rivians on the streets these days, too  which is great. Glad to see a startup other than Tesla really making it.

I see a surprisingly large number of EV ads on the baseball games I watch with my dad, tho that's the only place I ever see commercials. Always happy to see EVs doing well enough to see them being advertised in the mainstream.",10-14-2024

"Current EV Owners:  Looking for some feedback on a few fears before making the head first leap into an EV. Just looking for some honest, unbiased opinions here.  I know full well that by posting on this sub, a bias already exists, but perhaps some of you have some experiences you would like to share.

I am considering going full EV, but after putting down on paper my biggest apprehensions to doing so the short list is:

* having to sit somewhere for hours while the car recharges
* finding the right charging stations for the car itself (non-Tesla)
* finding non-dealer mechanics for maintenance
* resale value after 36 months

Thank you in advance.

Edit:  Great responses, thank you all.  I probably should have added. I live in NJ, no garage, but plenty of road trips ahead, thus the question about charging times and stations.

"Is my Ioniq 5 going to be the Bolt of the Tesla charging station?So I roll up to an EA and of course the two 350's are taken by Bolts sipping at a leisurely 50kw pace.  So I use the 150 and start pulling 175.  I'm done and on my way while the Bolts are still charging.  But still.  Those Bolts!  Grrr.

Yesterday when all the Tesla stations suddenly showed up in my Tesla app, I grabbed my Typhoon adapter and raced out to see if they were opened up to Hyundai (they aren't).  But in the process I discovered something.

Some day they will open to Hyundai.  And when they do... I am going to be the Bolt of the Tesla charger!  Unless I can get the end charger I'm forced to take two stalls - there's literally no other way to use a Tesla charger with the short cords.

And because the chargers are only 400V there is no way I can charge at more than 95 - 100kW.  (No it's not a software incompatibility  W = V \* A is a law of nature that no software can change).  Tesla can pull more amps than the Ioniq at a lower voltage so they will be coming and going long before I'm done.

"Full honest road trip experience with an evTo preface I'm Canadian and own a model 3 long range. I've had the car for 4 weeks and have put 4000km in that time. Ive done some 200km trips, a 1200km roundtrip, and just finished a 1600km roundtrip. For the 1200km within Canada trip it was no issue at all I charged up before leaving, stopped once halfway (half of a 550km leg) and had L1 charging at my destination which kept me topped up for everything I needed while there. Then did the same on the return. Spent about 35 minutes and $40 charging what would have usually been $100+ with my previous car. All chargers were on the route and that's about it. Little thought put into it and smooth sailing. 

Experience with 1600km roundtrip Canada to US..
I left with 95% and had to make 3 stops to get to my destination (~700km away). I had no charging at said destination so made sure to have enough to get there around 60%. Google said it's a 7h30 min drive but unfortunately a big portion of that route had no chargers so I had to go a different way, adding charging time it turned it to just over 9 hours to get there. 1 location had dented chargers and cables on the ground, most locations were in the middle of no where with random fast-food or just hotels near by. On the way back I stopped at a V4 station, excited to try it out and found atleast 3 of the stalls to not work at all. The one I plugged in only delivered 150kW. I ended up making 3 stops there and 3 back for 6 total. Spent 1h23m charging and $119. Until infrastructure gets much better it is a chore. I was of the opinion it's not that bad but in the end it turned a 15 hour driving time trip into 18+ hours after detours to get to chargers and back on the road, and waiting to charge. I did find 1 ""park and ride"" where I had L2 charging while we walked through a town we wanted to visit but if it wasn't for that we would've had to make yet another stop out of our way. This is with a ""long range"" Ev, on tesla infrastructure, with supposedly faster charging capabilities (can reach 250kW at low charge and certain stations).

I would do it again but not thrilled about the experience. I relied on tesla nav but I checked in with ABRP and it was showing similar things. The routes Google maps showed which were 30+ minutes faster weren't feasible due to long stretches with no fast charging forcing a detour. 

Any advice for next road trip? I could have checked plugshare for more L2 charging at malls or grocery stores and factored them in. Eye opening because my previous road trip was so smooth in comparison. For anyone interested it was an Ontario to Boston trip and back.

Also made me realize how much better a trip is when you have some way of charging at your destination overnight. The cost savings when relying on superchargers is minimal while the time added is not. ",10-10-2024

"Will GM end up selling more EVs in US/CAN across its brands than Tesla by 2030? GM electric vehicles have something that Tesla's don't. EPA ranges at highway speeds.

Actually, scrap that. GM EV line-up has plenty of things that Tesla vehicles don't.

1. EPA rated range at highway speeds.

2. Choices. For Tesla you have a pseudo SUV, a very good sedan, and high performance pseudo SUV and a high performance sedan, a mildly useful pickup. GM has a full sized SUVs, long range pickups, small sized SUVs (although GM screwed up Blazer EV), SUV-esqe wagons (Lyriq), possibly upcoming cheaper Chrysler 300 EV sedan, and even more SUVs like Tahoe and what not.

3. Ultium 20 and 24 module EVs charge better on supercharger than Tesla's own cybertruck. They hold on to 200kW till 70% which is insane.

From May 2023 - May 2024, Tesla sold around 618k cars in US. Include cybertruck full volume production sales, turns out around 875k total EV sales.

So, my question - with a wider choice, will GM be able to outsell Tesla, with single digit profitability by 2030? 

J3400 becoming a charging standard, I'm assuming other charging providers will have better reliability than what they can offer with CCS. GM cars from 2025/mid2025 plan to come standard with the j3400 charging port too. 

GM is already outselling Ford in EVs, and although the gap between #1 and #2 is still humongous in the North American USCAN market, with Tesla somewhere around 155-165k, and GM in US at 32095. 

Tesla currently sells FIVE times more EVs than GM, that's the difference between #1 and #2.

But will GM continue with this growth and be at a million EV sales a year by 2030, with Tesla in #2 at 875kish ?

I think that there's a 30% chance, yes.

Pathway to 1,000,000 EVs by 2030

2024: ~100k

2025: ~200k

2026: ~400k (break-even)

2027: ~550k (EBITDA positive)

2028: ~650k (low single digit net income)

2029: ~800k (single digit net income)

2030: ~1000k (sustained profitability into the future)

"Why do people like one-pedal driving?Everybody talks about this like it's the greatest thing ever. Tesla made a big deal when they added ""full one-pedal driving"" a few years ago so you could come all the way to a stop without using the brake. Reviewers take points off for EVs that don't support it. But my experience driving EVs is that I don't like it, and I turn it off whenever I can.

IMO the ICE model works well: push down on the GO pedal (accelerator) when you want to go, take your foot off the GO pedal to coast, use the STOP pedal (brake) when you want to slow down / stop. With one-pedal driving it's only really one-pedal as long as you have enough regen force to stop quickly enough. So when I'm driving I'm always having to judge whether or not the car is going to slow down enough with just regen or if I have to actually press the brake pedal. I also find it hard to modulate just enough throttle to slow down smoothly to a stop, or start out smoothly again.

So what am I not seeing? Why can't the EV give me the ICE-like experience of coasting when I let off the accelerator, use regen when I first start to press down on the brake, and then engage the friction brakes too if I'm trying to stop faster than pure regen will allow? One-pedal seems like it's just a way for the EV maker to cheat and force me to adapt to the way the car works, rather than the other way around.",10-07-2024
"Test Drove ~10 EVs at a local event, my thoughts on the winners and losersRecently, my area had an event to promote electric driving, with a bunch of EVs being available for test drives. Naturally I decided to go and try out some. I'm a I suppose soft car enthusiast; I love cars, I love driving, but I don't need a manual diesel with cloth seats and roll down windows to enjoy myself. So these reviews will be from that perspective, and trying to view it from the target audience

If you want to fight in the comments about how my takes are trash quickly, here is a tdlr:

Most Suprising (positive): Ford F150 Lightning

Most Suprising (negative): Hyundai Ioniq 5

Best Value: Tesla Model 3 Standard Range (Highland)

Worst Value: Tesla Model Y Standard Range

With that out of the way, let's get started, in no particular order:

1: Cadillac Lyriq: 7/10

This car feels like a classic Cadillac, for good and for ill. Everything about it is smooth, and it feels refined while putting its power down, not powerful but enough for what it is. Nothing particularly special in terms of charging or range, but I feel it fits the Cadillac clientel very well; lot's of room in the back and up front, touchscreen and cameras were good. UI was also very good, if a bit menu filled

It's downsides are, well, classically Cadillac. The interior was *okay*. The sound system was *okay*. But given the car's sticker said it was nearly *$91,000 CAD before tax* it shouldn't be *okay*. It should be at the tier of the Germans, and it still just... isn't. I wouldn't be as offended if it was significantly less pricey than something like the new Q6 or EQE SUV, but it isn't. Especially after the Neue Klasse iX3 gets here, they'll need to cut prices imo

2: Chevrolet Blazer: 4/10

Buy an Equinox. Or buy a Lyriq if you have the cash. This car feels like a worse version of both at the same time, and I'm not sure why. Chevy for some reason seems to not quite have 1 pedal driving down as well as Cadillac does, and while I could forgive this for the Equinox to an extent, it somehow feels worse in the Blazer. Likewise, the interior is a major downgrade from the Lyriq but not *really* an upgrade over the Equinox. There's stiching on the doors, but it's all softish plastic, not even fake leather. Dash feels very similar, as do the buttons to the Equinox. I'd say it's like \~10% nicer, and you get a HUD and a slightly larger vehicle than the Equinox. But if you want that, stretch for the Lyriq or get a slightly used one for the same price.

My first thought given the RS badge was that this would be the ""sporty"" one, but no. Zero steering feel, poor pedal feel, numb acceleration. I could forgive it, but given there's better options that GM makes, I think they just messed this one up

Oh, and normal door handles. The Blazer has that while the Equinox and Lyriq have the the pop out door handles. I have no idea why. It feels like they had a bunch of ICE Blazer door handles and want to use them up

3: Ford F-150 Lightning: 8/10

Now, to start; I am not a Truck guy. I don't have any use for one. No one in my family owns one. So keep that in mind for this review

But I gotta say, I was really blown away by the F-150 Lightning. It's a huge truck, but it really doesn't FEEL that way. The steering is good, manuverability is great, far better than you'd think for such a beast. Honestly, other than the massive tires reminding me, it felt like I was driving a midsized SUV, not a full sized truck

If you don't tow far or often, and you want a full sized, Ford is offering a whole bunch of cash on the hood. And it feels like a normal Ford! Physical gear shifter, same sort of seating, same UI. A bit meh UI, but it's very user friendly. I was genuinely shocked at how much I enjoyed it

It solves the two major issues imo of a full sized ICE truck; fuel economy and driving feel. If you can get a deal and want a truck; jump on it. Just be aware that this is very much a gen 1 product and won't hold value

4: Hyundai Ioniq 5: 8.5/10

You know that saying that a heretic is worse than a heathen? That's my experience with the Ioniq 5. It's *so close* to being a 10/10, but there's a few ergonomic issues that just really kill it

It has great one pedal driving, imo tied for 2nd with Tesla, slightly behind Volvo. Great charging speed, suprisingly fun handling given its an SUV. Read the reviews; it's great, everyone says it is, and I agree with them

*However*; 3 major issues that I found. First; the steering wheel obscures the gauge cluster unless you put it up unnaturally high. Second, the seat. I couldn't really find a comfy seating position; even with the seat all the way down, I felt like my head was almost touching the roof, and I'm not even that tall at \~6'1. Third, the bezels around the infotainment are absurdly large. It feels like an old timey TV with the massive box around them

Now, most of this is apparently fixed in the 2025 model year refresh. But it's just frustrating becasue even with the Ioniq 6 which I saw there, the bezel issue wasn't as bad. They know it's bad clearly! But it took awhile to fix. If you don't mind these things, then this is imo the best value. But I can't get over it

5: Tesla Model Y SR: 6/10

This is another similar casualty to the Blazer and the Ioniq 5. It's not AWFUL; although I find the interior to be pretty bad for the price. But the Model 3 highland fixes all the issues I have with the current Model Y, and it does it while being cheaper. I'd really, *strongly* recommend waiting until whatever the Model Y update

Drivetrain wise, pretty good! Tesla has good one pedal driving, like I said previously. It just falls apart with the interior quality. I found that the fake wood (or maybe real?) just felt really bad to the touch. I had a hard time adjusting the air vents in a pleasing way, which was annoying. The seats were just very uncomfortable, the merged headrest felt awful after awhile. Maybe if it was an economy car, whatever. But given the only configuration available for purchase new is the LR at \~$60,000 CAD, I expect better

Otherwise, I think it's... okay. For the price it was useable when the only competition it really has was the ID.4 and nearly impossible to get models like the Ioniq 5. But now supply has caught up, new models exist, and like I said; I *know* that Tesla can do better because they do! They have a great product in the form of the Model 3 Highland!

6: Chevrolet Equinox: 9/10

Chevy has a hit in the making if they can just market it well. This car will be my next vehicle.

Now that my cards are on the table, I will offer some criticism. The UI works fine, concerns there are overblown. But it's just a bit slow. Not the WORST (looking at you Volvo) by any means, but something that's disappointing. 1PD isn't super smooth, but it's less bad than the Blazer

Otherwise, I'll just say that this car provides value. Good range, okay charging speeds, but good enough. This is the car of close enough; everything except range isn't really class leading, but for the price and all together makes a great package

My biggest complaint? I'd like to denounce the Chevy exec who gave this thing 21 inch rims. It looks ridiculous, like a child wearing their father's shoes. But hey, maybe there were people who said ""yes, I'd love worse ride quality and worse fuel economy"". Maybe there are! If so, I'll apologize; you're a victim too

I honestly want to try and hypermile this. I genuinely think if I knocked this thing down to 19 or 18', I could hit the high 550s

7: Tesla Model 3 SR (Highland): 9/10

Tesla is the Apple of cars; you love it or you don't, but you have some sort of feeling about it one way or another. But if you're a spiritual Android user, if you can swallow your dislike, there's a LOT to like here

Every material issue I have with the model Y is basically solved. Better materials, better comfort, it feels quieter. Already very great UI is somehow even faster and better. For under $50k CAD, the RWD Standard range provides a whole bunch of value. \~440 km of range, good charging, access to the Tesla network (obviously), ventilated seats... again, 90% of my issue with it comes down to the monoscreen. I Just Don't Like It. It's not an issue for driving, but I don't find it aesthetically pleasing

But like I said; tonnes of value here if you like it or don't care about the layout.

8: BMW i4 M50: 10/10

You ever hear the phrase ""Jack of all trades, master of none. But better the Jack, than a master of one""? That is the BMW i4 to a tee. Nothing really crazy; even in terms of HP, there's faster cars out there. But my god does it come together in a fundamentally great package. The owner of this car was an enthusiasts, so he encouraged me to really give this the gas (or whatever) and it was great. He took over for awhile and REALLY gave it, and imo you could feel the weight around 9/10ths - but frankly, I don't think I'd ever get it there with any regularity, so the remaining 8/10ths are great

The only reason I wouldn't recommend it is that it's pricey. My man had literally every possible option, down to the full leather seats, and the special paint. He said it was near 100k all in all. Now he also mentioned offhandedly that his wife sat in and loved the new iX and so they bought it when he went to pick his new i4 up a few years back, so I assume he's good for money, but still. Damn pricey

After a few years of BMW depreciation though? Madon, fantastic used vehicle

9: Nissan Ariya: 6/10

Who is this for?

In theory, the Ariya isn't a bad vehicle. It's rather nice actually; comfortable interior, very smooth powertrain, nice touchpoints. Very roomy! It feels like a much larger vehicle than it is

My issue with it was that its top trim is nearly $*65,000 CAD*. And it used to be more! They simplified the 25 trim differences, and that used to hit the 70s! The small battery option is in the mid 50s, and then it gets progressively more expensive. What justifies that? No super fast charging like the Ioniq 5, no major range, not really any brand appeal. Nissan seemed to make a Murano equivalent, but I never see Muranos! I see Rogues! They needed a Leaf varient with Rogue styling, and didn't deliver. I saw one for sale today with an advertised $10,000 cash on the hood. That says everything, imo

If it topped out at, say, 60, then I think that'd be fair enough. But even then, I find the local Nissan dealership awful to talk with based on my sister's experience with them, but that's not necessarily Nissan's fault

11: Volvo EX40: 7.5/10

You know the gene some people have that makes Cilantro taste like soap? That's Volvo. You either have the gene that makes you love Volvo, or you don't. I happen to have it, but I'll try and be objective

The powertrain; fantastic. It's smooth, but not in the same way as Hyundai or Tesla with their 1 pedal driving. You feel everything, but it feels fantastic. Steering is tight while driving fast, while instantly becoming very light and manuverable at low speeds. Great sound system even in the ""cheap"" harmen kardon option versus the B&O, and incredibly comfortable seats, as Volvo often does well

The downside is that this is a 40 series, not a 60 series, and it feels like it. Not super plush in terms of touchpoints, the seats are a textile blend. But it still feels nice enough. It's also very clearly a first gen product; it's just an electric XC40. Infotainment system also needs some work; it's slow, menu hell, and just generally a pain

But like I said; it's just so *nice* that I can ignore any flaws. Buy it used or lease it, and wait for the new EX60 to come out",10-07-2024

I have to say between Chevy, GMC/ Hummer, and Cadillac- General Motors is producing stylish EVs that seemingly are designed well and generating buzz. I know I have heard of issues with the initial launch of the Lyriq (not sure the status of that currently), but my short driving experience today in the Lyriq has been far better than other EVs (namely Tesla and Volvo) that I have experienced so far.

Today's experience even has influenced a second consideration of Cadillac, especially if the Vistiq will be a comparable size to my MDX as an EV.

TL;DR: To my fellow EV enthusiasts, how are you feeling about GM's growing lineup? Do you think they have produced worthwhile vehicles to purchase thus far?

My question is framed from how many peers my age have been critical of GM since we watched many of our parents have GMs and Chryslers with loads of issues leading up to the bailout in 2008. I have long been an Acura/Lexus driver, but I have lost hope of the Japanese producing an EV like the MDX within the next few years and am accepting I likely will move on. Acura at best is coming out with a Buick Envista clone with a beak (concept), but Toyota seems more interested in calling their hybrids EVs instead. 

At this time, I'm waiting on the Lucid Gravity, considering the Cadillac Vistiq, and looking closer at BMW and Audi, too.",10-07-2024

"Has any other EV manufacturer replaced their 12V/low voltage battery with a lithium battery from the regular lead acid battery? Afaik, only Tesla has switched to 12/16V low voltage batteries to lithium based batteries. 

As there isn't an engine needed, the peak current output is really only for pumps and fans running off the low voltage system. 

Seems like a really good idea to get rid of the 10lb lead acid battery and replace it with a 2lb lithium cell based battery. Also, if made of LFP cells, that is essentially a forever part, not needing to be replaced in a decade, unless something really goes bad. You're simply shaving off 8lbs/4kg of mass.

As for the supply chain, if Tesla is doing it, wouldn't there be suppliers already doing the low voltage lithium or LFP based batteries? What's the bottleneck preventing other manufacturers from doing the same? ",10-06-2024
"How's your non-Tesla Supercharger experience at busy stations going?Took my non-Tesla EV to a Supercharger yesterday to test out the A2Z adapter. I'm going on a road trip around Thanksgiving and wanted to test the process to make sure I understood it and that it works as expected.

I got there and took up two spots (this is required) and immediately started to feel bad because it was a busy station. So I backed out and parked nearby hoping an end spot would open where I could charge without blocking a stall. A Lightning immediately pulled into the spot I had left, blocking both and started charging.

After waiting a bit, two spots side-by-side opened up so I decided to grab them since I was only planning to be there 5-10 minutes just to verify functionality. I parked blocking both spots and started charging. At this point the station was full and Teslas were circling around looking for spots. One guy parked nearby and was visibly angry. It looked like he was talking shit while staring over at me but didn't approach. Another angry older couple came up and asked me to move, but once they saw the situation with the short cable and I explained what was going on, they lightened up a little bit and started asking if I liked the car. By that point I'd done what I needed and left. As I was pulling out, a woman waiting in her Y flipped me off. I waved and smiled.

Maybe Tesla drivers don't realize what's going on and thought I was just being a dick? But with the Lightning there and a Rivian circling, I don't get the impression it's uncommon now to encounter someone taking up two spots. I also wonder if it's giving people a false sense of stall availability since I believe the Tesla app won't register two stalls being in use when you're using one and blocking one.",10-06-2024
"Shower thought: Do you reckon manufacturers will ever force servicing by bricking/limiting their EVs? Seems an odd question hey but hear me out....


With the lack of servicing EVs need, the ability for manufacturers to make revenue from servicing will be incredibly low. 


Do you ever see a scenario in years to come, where manufacturers realise they could have an extra stream of revenue, by forcing you to service your EV by means of limiting function or something similar?


Or do you suspect car makers accept their loss of revenue in maintenance and maybe tuck an extra price onto the sale? 


Edit:
There seems to be a lot of Tesla feedback. I'm out of the loop with Tesla, so I'm assuming this may be something that is actually happening for real with them? If so, that's just coincidence for this post üòÖ I was thinking more BYD. ",10-06-2024

"When will we see more EV sedans or coupe's?Lately I've noticed that almost all of the legacy auto makers are only unveiling crossovers/big SUVs for EVs. And even for the few sedans coming out, they have less range and horsepower than the model 3, but also cost more than the Model 3. I personally just don't feel very excited for new EVs, since they're all just copy and paste crossovers. Most of them also just copy Tesla's interior with limited buttons. The new Model 3 looks cool with its long range and high amount of horsepower, but I don't like it because it doesn't have buttons and I can't stand the fact that they got rid of the turn stalks. I also don't like Elon Musk. I really want to see some cool sporty EVs with lots of horsepower, having buttons for everything in the interior, good range and be reasonably priced. The new model 3 hits everything right except for the lack of buttons, turn stalk, and the fact that its a smartphone on wheels.

"Chevy Bolt on Tesla Charging Network Setup QuestionsHey folks! I have a 2017 Bolt. I've got the My Chevrolet app installed and what not, but I didn't see how to order an adapter for the plug to be compatible. I called up the GM EV concierge (which is an excellent service for GM EV related questions) and they said that I first needed to get in touch with OnStar (which they facilitated) and order the adapter through them for the appropriate part in the app to be enabled. Also, I had to get the adapter through GM to get access to the Tesla supercharger network and charge with that option.

Has anyone else completed this process? It seems like its accurate, but its only accurate through a narrow definition. I know there are third party adapters out there, and ordering those gets it in your hands faster than getting the genuine one through GM, it seems, too. It feels like an adapter, regardless of where it came from and the Tesla app to pay for the charging would/should suffice, but I don't know.

"Tesla Mobile charger working fine on 120V but today outlet suddenly stopped working?
I‚Äôve been charging Tesla MY using NEMA 5-15 charger in the garage on a regular 120V outlet for a month and it‚Äôs been working fine (drive very little). The same outlet has the garage door opener plugged in also (no other outlet in the garage so had to use that one), but since that‚Äôs not drawing a continuous load, figured it‚Äôs fine.  
This morning, we found the outlet not working. A couple things we‚Äôve tried/checked:  


* checked the breaker and looked like it was tripped/in off position. The circuit is also tied to upstairs bath which has GCFI. We turned the circuit back on and reset the GCFI in the bathroom , but the outlet still doesn‚Äôt work.
* not sure if this is relevant, but car finished charging as of 3am so it wasn‚Äôt actively charging when we found the outlet not working this morning?
* the circuit had been tripped one time 2 weeks ago, when the car was charging and i tried using hair dryer in upstairs bath. I understood that as too much load at once so since then never used hair dryer in that outlet.

So does this mean our outlet short circuited and the wires or receptacle need to be replaced? maybe bad connection that finally worn out or they were cheaply installed from previous owner? Should i just have electrician fix the 120 outlet and make sure to use industrial grade materials and then shouldn‚Äôt be a problem going forward with charging?Any other suggestions?",10-02-2024

I know most EVs have low voltage systems that are at 12V (for now) to run accessories, but I imagine the power rating on the low voltage battery is MUCH lower than for a gas car because there‚Äôs no engine to crank. So I‚Äôm guessing I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to jump someone else‚Äôs gas car with my Tesla, and if the low voltage battery on my EVs started to go I might get an alert to replace it well before the car isn‚Äôt able to start/drive.

"Just bought a Onvo L60 today!Nio‚Äôs younger sibling in the house!

I woke up today and decided it was time to go out and finally buy my first car in China. I was thoroughly impressed by the L60. Benchmarked against the acclaimed model Y it is more spacious, luxurious, cheaper and more convenient. The styling is personal but I think it looks just as great, if not better. Compared to Xpeng G6, BYD Song, Denza, Nio ES/EC etc.. it seems to provide the greatest balance of design, luxury, convenience and cost.

Space: the clean interior borrows a lot from the model 3 which still has the appeal for those looking for a minimalist feel while adding some features of luxury. By far the MASSIVE 2nd row legroom and lay flat front seats are the real seller though. The car is only 8cm longer than the model Y and yet the amount of legroom achieved seems to appear way longer. Curious if anyone has a cabin cross-section comparison.

  
Luxury: the L60 comes pretty much fully loaded. Front cooled and air bag massaged seats, Heated four seats, as many cameras and 360 you'd like, pretty advanced ADAS/AD features. The fit and finish seems excellent. The quality of materials is mid-end, so a huge step-up from Teslas bare bones materials approach. 

Cheaper: here's another real winner. The BAAS system brought the car down to 149k RMB, or \~21k USD out the door. I will get to rent the battery for 599rmb a month and not have to worry about battery health maintenance degradation / depreciation due to outdated chemistries.

  
Convenience: battery swapping anyone? I'll also get to change pack size plans according to our needs. Long road trip coming ahead? Swap up to the larger pack by upgrading the BAAS rental package.

  
Only downside I can tell right now, production queue is advertised to a worst case of 2 months leadtime atm...

"Canadians got this charging situation (comparing to poor and pathetic Northeast)I have been driving and charging my EV around Quebec city, northern townships, both city and country. It is just another world in terms of charging stations comparing to the experience we have in New England, or Northeast in general, in my opinion.

Most of the anxiety disappeared when I was in Quebec. Locals probably know better, but the amount and the quality of Electric Circuit stations throughout the state is far more better than what we have in Northeast. Its almost a nightmare to drive non-tesla car, and need to charge in public DC stations in US. There are far more stations I noticed (in my drive from US border to Quebec, there were decent station facilities almost every 50kms). Most of the stations have two car/active plug support. And, the stations are either in service plazas or just nearby shops, restaurants, or grocery stores. Moreover, I needed only one app, not like zillions of subpar networks we have. Just amazing. I was actually depressed that I had to drive all the way back through Northeast and I pretty much know it would be a nightmare to find a functional plug for 200 miles. And when I do find, there will be at least 2-3 cars in the line. No, there won't be a station 30 miles down the road, either. The next one is, with all the same problems, 80 miles away.

"Some positive re-encouragement needed feels like I've got (fomo) With stocks ripping to new highs. BTC on the brink of 100K I just feel like threw an opportunity to be financially free. 

I've trying to plan moves but don't know if it's even worth it at this point. It everything keeps on ripping I'm just gunna feel devastated losing positions I shouldn't have traded out of. 

But then if I reinvest. I'm probably subjecting myself to a possible downside of a crash and considering how high major stocks are such as $Tesla $Btc, $Mstr, $Hood  just to name a few. I just don't know what the play is anymore. I'm at a total loss mindset. 

Btc is too far gone for me to make any real worthwhile profit. I dont have the surplus amount in capital or savings to enjoy making a trade. The ""what goes up must come down looms"" 

I had a plan but now I'm just dragging along. In the hopes of some black Swan event.

I believe RKLB has loads of potential and that the stock will shoot up as soon as they get a successful Neutron launch out of the way. Also, despite what some are fearing, I doubt Elon would interfere in RKLB's business. Neutron is not a F9 competitor for now and until they can get their cadence up, it won't even be. A Trump presidency does not seem like that much of a risk. Especially with Elon fighting for things like deregulation, which will help everyone including RKLB. I do understand going all in on a single company stock like RKLB is very risky, but if things do pan out, this will be like buying Tesla in the early 2010s. Space is the new market and RKLB is right behind SpaceX in it. I'm 15 so I have a long investment horizon.",11-13-2024

Earnings: LYV, GRAB, MNDY, ",11-11-2024
"Last week's high volume stocks* **TSLA -** Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, 
* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.
* **AMZN** \- Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now.
* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.
* **NVDA** \- Three weeks ago Nvidia had weekly breakout and then it retested those levels before continuation to the upside last week. I had given target of $154 last month and I believe it will hit that target.",11-11-2024

"RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

What do you guys think?",11-06-2024
"Why Donald Trump‚Äôs Return Could Boost Demand for Robots ‚Äì A Long-Term Investment OpportunityHey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there‚Äôs more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap‚Äîand robots could be the answer.

That‚Äôs where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let‚Äôs talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they‚Äôve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we‚Äôre talking about. RR‚Äôs service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they‚Äôre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn‚Äôt just conceptual‚Äîit‚Äôs been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there‚Äôs Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we‚Äôre after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",11-06-2024
"Educate me about stock So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it).

"Tesla Soars to Best Day in 11 Years After a Blowout Quarter> Tesla Inc.‚Äôs shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.

"Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental creditsTesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts‚Äô forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla‚Äôs growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

"Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google‚Äôs self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that‚Äôs over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google‚Äôs search business is under threat, it‚Äôs important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing *really* good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually.

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter
Tesla‚Äôs stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla‚Äôs growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.

In the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla‚Äôs lead remains substantial.

Tesla‚Äôs 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.

Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company‚Äôs upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.

"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and AtlantaUber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips‚Äîexclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo‚Äôs co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

"Opportunity In OracleI‚Äôve been hearing how oracle expects 9% revenue growth for FY 25 they also said for Q3 and Q4 24 they had signed their largest contracts to date. 

I‚Äôve also heard examples of how‚Äôd they‚Äôd apply their tech. One example tied to the medical industry. Say a doctor wanted to pull up past CT scans, MRIs, or other tests when meeting with a patient they can voice request these from Oracles database. Hospital,  physician offices, and dentists offices at least in my area always feel like they have some of the most outdated data systems I‚Äôve ever seen. Whether or not hospital managers feel like forking out money to upgrade is another question, but if they were to upgrade to something this feels like it would actually improve efficiency.

I‚Äôve heard from Oracle execs before around integration of AI in automating some data pulls. It seems like something that‚Äôs been on their radar for years. To me this seems like a value offering of their DBMS and their cloud Services. 

I‚Äôm a little skeptical on near term feasibility of the more complex things Oracle claims on automated analyses. In practice there‚Äôs so much nuance to data that I wouldn‚Äôt currently trust this to handle complex questions that require strategic thinking and business knowledge. So personally I don‚Äôt buy claims around complex analyses anytime soon. 

One other thing was Oracle is also quite literally designing data centers that would be powered by SMRs in addition to expanding their existing data center footprints. SMRs historically have been quite expensive to install, but curious to see if there are long term cost savings by doing this. 

It seems like they have a feasible vision for how the products can be used everyday and commercialized. On one hand you have companies like Tesla promising C-3PO and on the other hand companies like Oracle are promising something that feels much closer and real, with practical use cases.

What are other things you think might drive value or detract value to Oracle in the future. Do you think it‚Äôs overvalued (if so why?)? 

Also, did anyone have any interesting reads around this to share? Trying to learn more about their business plan. ",09-12-2024

"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robotsRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since MayWaymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

"Tesla Stops Taking Orders For Its Least Expensive Cybertruck ($61K), Cheapest Cybertruck Now Costs $99,990 Tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry-level Cybertruck, which was originally priced at $61,000, leaving the $100,000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. This move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by CEO Elon Musk, who in 2019 projected that the Cybertruck would cost around $40,000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. Now, the least expensive model available is the dual-motor Foundation series, which is priced at $99,990 and offers a 318-mile range. This model is available for delivery as soon as this month, while the higher-end $119,990 tri-motor Cyberbeast, which has a 301-mile range, is expected to be delivered starting in October.

Despite Musk's earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations, some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected, especially for the higher-priced models. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, noted that this latest move ""shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks,"" particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option.

Tesla's shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability, even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. The Cybertruck, with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the ""Blade Runner"" movie and its stainless-steel body, has certainly captured the imagination of many, but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some.

Sales figures show that Tesla sold nearly 4,800 Cybertrucks in July, marking its best month yet and making it the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. priced over $100,000. However, maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. A spokesperson for Cox Automotive commented that while Tesla has sold more than 16,000 units so far, ""sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge,"" reflecting the potential difficulty Tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup.

The Cybertruck‚Äôs journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges, with deliveries only beginning in November 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp-up. With the latest pricing strategy, Tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high-end models to carry the day, but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen.

"Possible Bullish Thesis on HertzI know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

What are your thoughts?  
Do you see value in this thesis?  
Do you have a strong counter argument?

Looking forward to your thoughts. Thanks!",08-06-2024

"How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investmentüí∏Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes.

If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more.

However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well.

One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle...

https://preview.redd.it/lyt5r3kmn3cd1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe179e72d777caf49e6d8c0e66ec800f6f39d34a

Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors?

Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow.

This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.

James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get.

Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport.

I believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does).

I've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla.

Tesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too...

https://preview.redd.it/pnc5gnmsn3cd1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba5c2e8b2be1dcdd27e20bc81f604e2f627b7beb

When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government.

Seeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now.

"Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian (RIVN)Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian (RIVN)

Roughly 2 years ago I saw my first Rivian truck in the wild in my local suburbs of Cincinnati‚Ä¶ since then I‚Äôve seemingly seen more and more every month. 

Is this is similar trend in other cities in the US? - if so does this mean Rivian may be a worthy investment? ‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt researched the company much but feel like this is a trend worth noting that has me interested in investing. 

So I ask : is this reason enough to invest in Rivian? Could its business model follow the footsteps of Tesla (or even come remotely close?) at $15 a share I‚Äôm beginning to get FOMO and asking myself ‚Äúwhy not buy 100 shares and see what happens?‚Äù 

Do any of you own Rivian stock? If you had $1500 buying power to spare in a $60k portfolio would you take a risk on Rivian? If not what would you buy instead? 

Thanks! ",07-09-2024

"RIVN: To Buy or Not to Buy? A Comprehensive AnalysisThere's been a lot of discussion about Rivian (RIVN) lately, with opinions split between supporters and skeptics. Some are even comparing RIVN to Tesla, with analyst Gary Black suggesting ""RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019."" Let's break down the pros and cons of RIVN as we know them:

# Positive Factors

The main factor is Volkswagen's recent $5B investment, which has significantly extended the liquidity runway.

[Data by The Asian Investor, seekingalpha.com](https://preview.redd.it/yaykx1avd59d1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea76e2e72d388f4e794ba64a8eadeb11da8f97ee)

**Additional key considerations:**

1. Strong balance sheet with $7.9B cash/investments as of Q1 2024
2. New factory in progress + tax incentives for existing facility
3. Positive sentiment around trucks and vans, with super loyal fanbase
4. R&D in Serbia, reducing costs
5. Shifting to base platform + add-ons model
6. New R2 model has more reservations than total yearly production
7. Potential for expanded partnerships.
8. Expected gross profit by year-end could boost stock to $20-25 range

Thanks to u/bluecap for additional insights from previous discussion.

# Challenges

Declining cash balance and high cash burn rate during production ramp-up since FY 2022 is a main risk.

[RIVN Cash and Short Term investments, takeprofit.com](https://preview.redd.it/dj9jdw6yd59d1.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb6a6813e1d3d7941e1835d5639766028a1af9f)

Competition from established automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers is important to consider as the market becomes increasingly competitive.

* Current P/S ratio of 1.8x, below 3-year average of 3.0x
* Average 12-month price target from 23 analysts: **$14.52** (range $8-$21)

# Technical Analysis

[Chart and analysis by takeprofit.com\/@mustermann84](https://preview.redd.it/7nc6yyt3e59d1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc8530008238aa27c0566f25c1875b06e5b5bded)

* Weekly chart indicates a possible trend reversal (depicted as a ""Black Swan"" pattern resembling a head and shoulders formation)
* Possible interim price targets in identified cluster zones
* MACD indicates a potential long-term reversal 

# Conclusion

Rivian's profile has improved significantly, addressing previous concerns. The Volkswagen investment is a game-changer for risk mitigation. However, cash burn remains a concern, with negative free cash flow of $1.5B in Q1 2024. The new investment extends the runway to 8-9 quarters, reducing immediate financial pressure.

I will closely monitor Rivian's performance and how it handles challenges, especially from Chinese rivals.

"Rivian / The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern.# Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive?

# The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation.

[Black Swan Pattern ](https://preview.redd.it/uoymop1yx49d1.png?width=3660&format=png&auto=webp&s=63fbaa0ad8bbdfd7e3a140f33213bd35c1adb1a7)

# 

¬†There is a so-called Black Swan pattern, which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal.¬†The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements.

* The smaller Fibonacci is the so-called conservative retracement.
* ¬†The longer-term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement.

For the technical analyst, the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible (interim) price targets. In this context, the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy, structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart.¬†

How do you view the merger, and do you see a realistic chance for VW to assert itself against BYD and Tesla with this collaboration? The chart at least offers a perspective on a fruitful collaboration.",06-27-2024

"VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves?Hello, 21 year old here

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right? Could people, in tech, working for cisco or nokia, really not see the future of aapl and msft back in the early 2000s? Was it really that blinding? ",06-13-2024
"Tesla shareholders voting yes for Musk's $56 billion pay package, CEO tweets",06-13-2024
"Fear that I've already missed out (the opposite of FOMO)?I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think ""heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then, rather than buying in with that realization, I talk myself out of it. ""How much more can it really go up?"" I don't know... Examples: Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I've since watch both explode and its like ""damn! why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies?"" Those are the most obvious misses I've made.

I'm curious how you determine when you've missed your opportunity. I'm not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don't care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn't think most companies were a safe long-term bet. But, there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn't have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity, I'm like ""is now the best time to buy? Its already doubled since I was ready to enter."" 

I'm currently don't have much liquidity so I'm not buying. But, by the end of the year, I should have $20-30k freed up. And, if some of the stocks I'm currently interested in go up, I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere ""safer."" Besides the argument that over an x number of years, almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you've missed out.",06-12-2024

Tesla shareholder sues Musk for alleged $7.5 billion insider trading,06-02-2024
The Growth of Top Tech Stocks ( 5-yr period),05-30-2024
"Are You Proud of the Companies You Invest In?Hey!

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",05-26-2024

Summary: 

- UBS downgrades rating on Big Six tech companies (excluding Tesla) to neutral from overweight.
- Grouping includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
- The group has dropped 8% from its April peak, having surged 117% from Jan. 2023 lows.
- Nvidia fell 10% as AI stocks retreated.
- Earnings per share growth expected to slow to 16% from 42%.
- COVID-19 pandemic caused an asynchronous earnings cycle.
- Deceleration in large cap tech and acceleration in mid cap tech may lead to a reversal in stock leadership.
- Non-tech companies expected to see earnings shift from a 3% fall in Q1 to a 19% fall in Q1 2025.
- Shift may be disruptive in the short term, but UBS reiterates S&P 500 target of 5,400 for end of year, citing positive fundamentals and a robust economy.

DB cuts Tesla 2027 delivery estimate by more than 1 million! 3.315 mil to 2.144 mil now. 2027 EPS estimate slashed from $4.25 to $2.40.

Nearing the January 2023 gap.

Since Tesla announced a 10% global workforce reduction on April 15th, more challenges have arisen. 

According to reports, a key Tesla supplier disclosed a 30% decrease in supply to the company. Tesla's Shanghai factory, the supplier's biggest customer, has consistently placed stable orders in the past year. However, Tesla's sudden decrease in order volume has significantly affected the supplier, indicating an implementation of substantial production cuts.

Tesla's China wholesale volume fell 4% YoY to 220.9k units in Q1 2024.

"BYD Company (Chinese Stock) 

**BYD Company Stock (Chinese Stock)**

**My Thesis:**

BYD is unknown, undervalued and currently growing at a very aggressive rate and has a lot of future potential to do well.

In 2023 Q4, BYD overtook Tesla in the number of EV sales (526000 BYD to 484000 Tesla) meaning it became the number one EV player in the market. At the rate BYD is growing at, they will be a dominant force in the market in the years to come when cars transition to electric.

However there are many risks associated with a new, upcoming car brand in the industry of automotives particularly as it is a Chinese company. 

**Pros of BYD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4uygiuo47mc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b5e265ae4b72a5f6ee754ca9adafef3825dca7

**BYD** as a whole is growing at a very aggressive rate from almost doubling its revenue from 2021 to 2022. As it looks to expand into new horizons, there is more potential for growth as it taps into Europe, Southeast Asia, Mexico and Brazil where they have only begun rolling out their EVs in 2022/2023.

Strong balance sheet

Cash 51,471 Billion CNY

Debt (Current 11,618 + Long Term 10,211) =  21,829 Billion CNY

Cash is double debt

From 2020 - 2022 BYD has been free cash flow positive.

BYD is undervalued compared to Tesla (28/2/24) at time of writing

**BYD Ratios**

PS 0.92

PB 4.09

P/E 18.64

EV/EBITDA 12.55

**Tesla Ratios**

PS 6.56

PB 10.14

P/E 46.9 

EV/EBITDA 41.24 

Vertical Integration allows BYD to keep EVs at an affordable price to help maximize its sales. Instead of purchasing parts/components from external companies, BYD makes most of its components by itself e.g. batteries, IGBT transistors (2 of the most expensive parts) and electronic components. The only parts BYD reported that they don‚Äôt make are the windows and tires.

BYD is heavily supported by the Chinese government through subsidies to help lower costs for them which allows BYD cars to be sold at a very affordable cost for consumers particularly in the Asian markets.

**Challenges + Risks** 

BYD is relatively unknown in the automobile industry and tapping into developed markets like Germany, Japan and America will be very difficult. There will be challenges in convincing consumers to transition from well-known brands with much longer history such as Toyota and Volkswagen etc... This is particularly true with the skepticism surrounding EVs and Chinese companies in general.

BYD experienced this issue when they tried to sell their electric bus fleets in North America back in 2015. However, through successful marketing and branding strategies BYD managed to win consumers and now 50% of electric buses are from BYD. There is a big question whether BYD is able to market strategically and convince the public of its electric cars.

Heavy tariffs placed on BYD in Europe/America will severely cut BYD‚Äôs margins where we are seeing 25% tariffs in the likes of America combined with the difficulty of marketing their EVs to the public. This is due to the ‚Äúunfair playing advantages‚Äù BYD has had from Chinese government subsidies. [EU anti-subsidy probe into electric vehicle imports from China | Think Tank | European Parliament (europa.eu)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2023)754553#:~:text=On%204%20October%202023%2C%20the,vehicles%20(BEVs)%20from%20China.) There is also a question of what will happen in the future if the Chinese government reduces the subsidies it is giving to BYD.

Currently most of BYD‚Äôs revenue is from China so there are risks associated with how the Chinese economy does. But BYD is looking to diversify by expanding globally as mentioned previously.

One of the biggest risks is the ‚ÄúChina Risk‚Äù. We have seen crackdowns in large Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent due to their market dominance, unfair competition and fraudulent practices. As a result we have seen Chinese stocks plummeting down and losing a lot of value in recent years. Whether BYD will be a target of this when they grow further in the future is a red flag for many investors.

There has been a recent announcement by Biden that Chinese EVs will be banned in America due to safety issues and it is possible that European countries may follow in the footsteps of America and the bans could spread to the developed Western countries (Australia, Canada, Western Europe) etc. This is certainly a big risk to BYD's opportunity to expand into the Western markets as they have just recently set up new bases in the likes of Germany and Australia. Future revenues will take a big hit and earnings potentials will be seriously limited if this is the case. The geopolitical tensions between the West and China is a major risk factor we have to account for.

**Summary**

In conclusion, BYD presents an interesting investment opportunity. The company has demonstrated impressive growth, overtaking Tesla in EV sales and expanding into new markets. Its strong balance sheet, positive free cash flow, and undervaluation compared to Tesla suggest potential for significant upside. Vertical integration and government subsidies have allowed BYD to keep prices competitive and penetrate markets effectively. While there are challenges, such as tapping into developed markets and navigating tariffs, BYD has shown resilience and adaptability in the past. The company's efforts to diversify its revenue streams and expand globally mitigate risks associated with its reliance on the Chinese market. Recent announcements of potential bans in Western countries could pose a significant threat to BYD‚Äôs expansion plans. While the ""China Risk"" is a concern, BYD's track record and strategic positioning make it a promising stock for investors looking to capitalize on the growing EV market and the transition to electric vehicles particularly in the developing countries.

**My Take:**

Yes we have seen the large crackdown on big tech stocks in China. However, BYD works closely with the government and is supported through subsidies, incentives and government support so it is in BYD's interest to follow CCP's policies and regulations. China recognizes that they are facing a global warming crisis and are transitioning to ""clean up"" their country through switching to EVs so it is in the CCP's interest to work with BYD. The world is larger than America/Europe and there is a huge market in the developing nations. I recognize that there are many risks in investing in BYD but for the valuation it is currently at, I believe it is undervalued and there is significant potential in the years to come. ",03-03-2024

I use Fidelity and look at the guidance that they have for the research. For the most part I am seeing that I should probably just sell 3M and Tesla but might want to hold on to Boeing as they have some potential large orders in negotiations. Tesla looks like it is going to stick until late 2025.

When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies, do you go off what they say with their research tools? If not, how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers? Better to take a loss and hope to make it up with a stronger stock? Do you utilize the investment companies to provide individualized guidance? Is that worth it?

"[OC] The case for Peloton (PTON) 3 points to consider:&#x200B;

There is no doubt that Peloton stock has had a roller coaster ride since 2020.

When Peloton IPO'd in 2019, it was priced around $25-$30 a share.  When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.

This huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  ""sunk cost fallacy"" trap. Which states: ""It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.""  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The ""sunk cost fallacy"" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.

**Points to consider:**

It is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as ""turning the corner"", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.

1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the ""treadmill for the rich"" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new ""video game"" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun).
2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the ""household"" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is
3. **""Great product not a great stock""** \- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow ""separate"" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks ""great""., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant ""moats"" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.

I would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.

- Deliveries +20% YoY to 485k‚úÖ

Overall, #expectations from #analysts were narrowly missed, yet the long-term perspective for #Tesla remains exceptionally attractive. AI and robotics will increasingly come into focus.

#Sales
Vehicle deliveries increased from 405,278 to 484,507, a 20% rise from Q4-2022 to Q4-2023. Elon Musk hinted in the conference call that Tesla's FY24 Volume growth ""may be notably lower.""

#Revenue
Increased from $24.32 bn. to $25.2 bn. - a moderate growth of 3.6%. Despite increased deliveries, lower prices per vehicle & an unfavorable model mix (more lower-priced models) dampened the revenue increase.

#Margin
Declined from 16% to 8.2% - here the price reductions & higher production costs due to the Cybertruck are evident. Operating income fell from $3.89 bn. to $2.06 bn. Another positive note is the increase in EBIT margin compared to Q3-2023 at 7.6% - the bottom has been passed!

#EPS (Adjusted)
This fell from $1.19 to $0.71, a 40% decrease. Despite a one-time tax benefit of $1.56 per share (or $5.9 bn.), the decline in profitability metrics could not be offset.

#FreeCashflow & #Cash
Jumped from $1.42 bn. to $2.06 bn. (+45%). As a result, the cash balance increased from $22.2 bn. to $29.1 bn. (+31%). This demonstrates Tesla's ability to efficiently generate and utilize capital - even in challenging times!

#Guidance
Despite the solid figures, the guidance for 2024 remains cautious. Expected lower growth rates in vehicle volume could cool growth, while the focus is on the next generation of vehicles (Model 2/A in 2025 for $25,000).",01-25-2024
"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541

Data Sources:

* SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã
* SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)

**Key Observations:**

* Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA.
* Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY.
* Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.

It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.

I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:

1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market.
2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy.
3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results.
4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy.
5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform.
6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.

It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Anyone knows about this fund i bought it from Wise. Appreciate your comments.
I bought like 250$ iShares World Equity Index Fund (LU) It includes Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon Com Inc, Nvidia Corp, Meta Platforms Inc Class A, Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc Class A, United Health Group Inc and more but Apple has the biggest share in the fund. Fund manager is BlackRock and risk score is 6 out of 7 i guess this is high because all these companies are the biggest in the world so i thought it would be more safer but this risk score i don‚Äôt know. Appreciate your advice. I do not need this money in short-term tho but i am wondering is this fund aims to make profit in long term or mid term?

"Nikola (NKLA) thoughts?The expert evaluation is technically Hold, understandably so.  To me it looks like a cheap penny stock to maybe explode in a few years. Company was worth 80$ per share in 2020, although based on lies the company told their investors, which he‚Äôs doing 4 year time in prison for now.  But to see the gains like that, and where they‚Äôre at now, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to throw 5 grand at it now .80cents per share, to potentially be  $40,000 in a few year if they get back to where they were ? 

The company did develop and sell 35 hydrogen powered electric heavy trucks last year, the first of their rollout.  Those trucks do currently have a recall that they‚Äôre fixing. 

Given the scandal years ago , and the mechanical troubles now I definitely feel the apprehension, but the company is resilient and considered by some to be in a hiccups stage, potentially rising to a Tesla of the workforce so to speak someday. 

Thoughts or insight on Nikola?",01-05-2024
"Tesla: How about its inventory level?A lot of posts are talking about Tesla's production and deliveries in 2023, thus would like to look into the numbers from another perspective.

# INVENTORY

https://preview.redd.it/omsupf0ar1ac1.jpg?width=424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2309e6cfc9f615286d06e98ab7bb200c91aa9c13

When we look at the production and deliveries numbers between 2021 and 2023, it is not difficult to identify that the aggregate production is larger than the aggregate deliveries \[note: -5,750 for FY2021, +55,760 for FY2022 and +37,404 for FY2023\].

With the fierce competition observed in the market (lead to price slash and hence decline in gross profit margin) as well as the loss of tax credit / green benefits in 2024 (lead to possible lower demand for some of its core products), wonder if inventory will become a problem for the company in future.

Feel free to discuss.",01-02-2024

"I think  everyone is missing the point with the latest Optimus robot demonstrationsI have seen a lot of articles and posts from ‚ÄúThe Verge‚Äù and ‚ÄúFuturism‚Äù and others pointing out the robots were obviously remote controlled by humans.

Firstly, when have we ever seen a completely untethered battery powered robot that allows you to remotely control human body movements to that level of accuracy? That alone was science fiction until now.

Secondly, what this level of fine control enables is training data AND supervised learning. We all know that the plan is to use AI, not hard coding to teach Optimus how to do useful tasks. The problem is how to record human movement pattern into data that a robot understands. What easier way than controlling the robot directly, and taking the reins to correct if it makes the wrong movement. Remove control provides all this information in the same way as the LLMs feed on text.

And so the infeasible suddenly looks very feasible indeed. Optimus really will be able to perform most tasks that a human can. You don‚Äôt need to be an AI expert to understand it.

There is this weird focus on what Optimus can‚Äôt do yet, or what Boston Dynamics can do better, and yes, I think this demonstration was poorly communicated. However I don‚Äôt think people are understanding the magnitude of what Tesla has already achieved at this stage.",10-22-2024

"Canada EV Tariffs, will this impact Canadian Tesla prices/incentives? There may be a paywall for this article so please find it here:

Canada will impose new tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, aluminum and steel, lining up behind western allies and taking steps to protect domestic manufacturers.
The government plans to announce a 100% levy on electric cars and 25% on steel and aluminum, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because the matter is still private. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to unveil the policy in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he‚Äôs gathered with the rest of his cabinet for a series of meetings about the economy and foreign relations.
Canada, an export-driven economy that relies heavily on trade with the US, has been closely watching moves by the Biden administration to erect a much higher tariff wall against Chinese EVs, batteries, solar cells, steel and other products. Canada‚Äôs auto sector is heavily integrated with that of its closest neighbor: The vast majority of its light vehicle production ‚Äî which was 1.5 million units last year ‚Äî is exported to the US.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, the most powerful person in Trudeau‚Äôs cabinet, has been one of the most prominent voices in favor of a harder approach to Chinese vehicle exports, and becoming a closer trade ally with the US.

In June, she announced a public consultation on possible measures to make it more difficult for Chinese companies to sell electric vehicles in the Canadian market. The auto industry, she said, is ‚Äúfacing unfair competition from China‚Äôs intentional, state-directed policy of overcapacity that is undermining Canada‚Äôs EV sector‚Äôs ability to compete.‚Äù
In July, Freeland went further. During an interview with Bloomberg News, she said the tariffs consultation might go beyond electric cars.
‚ÄúGeopolitics and geoeconomics is back,‚Äù she said at the time. ‚ÄúThat means that Western countries‚Äî and very much the US ‚Äî is putting a premium on secure supply chains and is taking a different attitude towards Chinese overcapacity.‚Äù
‚ÄòNo Illusion‚Äô
The European Union has also announced proposed new tariffs on electric vehicles important from China, though at lower levels than the US and now Canada are proposing.
Products made by SAIC Motor Corp. face additional duties of 36.3%, while Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and BYD Co. each face tariffs of 19.3% and 17%, respectively, according to a draft decision released last week. Tesla Inc. will see an extra 9% charge on Chinese-made vehicles.

Chinese leaders plan to raise the issue of tariffs when US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan visits this week, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Sullivan is due to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and may also meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

China has retaliated against Canada before. It previously restricted imports of Canadian canola seed for three years ‚Äî a move seen as retribution for a decision by Canada authorities to arrest Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. Meng returned to China in 2021.
The value of Chinese electric vehicles imported by Canada surged to C$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) last year, from less than C$100 million in 2022, according to data from Statistics Canada. The number of cars arriving from China at the port of Vancouver jumped after Tesla Inc. started shipping Model Y vehicles there from its Shanghai factory.
However, the Canadian government‚Äôs main concern isn‚Äôt Tesla, but the prospect of cheap cars made by Chinese automakers eventually becoming available. BYD informed the Canadian government in July that it intends to lobby lawmakers and officials about its plans to enter the country.
Trudeau also faced political and industry pressure. The Canadian auto sector had been pushing him to hike tariffs to protect domestic jobs and wages, arguing that China‚Äôs EVs are cheaper due to much weaker labor standards. The government has also bet big on automakers and manufacturers from democratic allies: the government has agreed to to multibillion-dollar subsidies for electric vehicle plants or battery factories for Stellantis NV, Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co., among others.
Steel and aluminum producers in Canada have also publicly and repeatedly urged the government to restrict China‚Äôs access, saying that Xi‚Äôs industrial policy allows the Asian powerhouse to unfairly flood foreign markets, putting local jobs at risk.
‚ÄúChina does not play by the rules,‚Äù Catherine Cobden, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, told reporters earlier this month. ‚ÄúGovernment should be under no illusion that they do.‚Äù",08-26-2024

"Replicate a hand-free trunk with iOS Shortcuts and NFC tags*With an iPhone, Apple‚Äôs Shortcuts app, and an NFC tag, you can make pretty much any Tesla have a hands-free\* trunk by following this guide.  Scroll to the end if you are already familiar with iOS Shortcuts and want the quick setup guide.*

My 2023 Long Range Model Y unfortunately does not work with Tesla‚Äôs recent hands-free trunk feature since the Model Y lacks the UWB hardware.¬† However, I replicated similar behavior (within a window of time), and wanted to share how in case someone else would find it useful.¬† The only downside is that you need to roughly estimate how long it will take you to walk to your Tesla.  The NFC tag on the Tesla is also pretty ugly, but at the same time helps you pick out your white Tesla among the 10 others in the parking lot haha.

\* This is hands-free once you've reached your Tesla within the chosen time window, but requires you to first manually run the shortcut. This can be useful if you know you are about to head to your Tesla with your hands full and don't already have access to Siri via an Apple Watch or AirPods.

https://reddit.com/link/1dsjrlp/video/jxi7vtlvvt9d1/player

**You will need:**

* An iPhone that supports background NFC reading (iPhone XR/XS and later)
* Apple‚Äôs [Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334)
* NFC tags - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPJ5DDCQ)
* A Tesla that supports opening the trunk with the Tesla app and iOS Shortcuts
* A custom shortcut I created called [Hands Free Trunk](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/29f19ada5bc444059394c7c885b38c1a)

**Detailed Setup Guide:**

*If you are already familiar with iOS shortcuts, see my quick setup guide at the bottom.*

* Stick an NFC tag onto your Tesla at a height where the top of your iPhone lines up with the tag while in your pocket.  *Note: the NFC tags I listed do not work when placed on metal.¬† So you will need to place the tag on a section of the Tesla that is plastic, like the bumper.¬† There are NFC tags that do work on metal that you can purchase instead.*
* Make sure you have the [Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) installed on your iPhone.
* [Enable third party shortcuts](https://www.howtogeek.com/686572/how-to-find-and-install-third-party-shortcuts-on-iphone-and-ipad/) so you can install the shortcut I created.¬† See below for how this shortcut works in depth and how to customize it.
* Use [this link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/29f19ada5bc444059394c7c885b38c1a) to add my custom shortcut called ‚ÄúHands Free Trunk‚Äù. When you open the link, tap ‚ÄúGet Shortcut‚Äù at the bottom.¬† The Shortcuts app will open, then tap ‚ÄúAdd Shortcut‚Äù at the bottom.¬† The shortcut should then show up in the app in your All Shortcuts list.
* Open the Shortcuts app and tap on the ‚ÄúAutomation‚Äù tab along the bottom.¬† Tap the plus icon to create a new automation.¬† Choose ‚ÄúNFC‚Äù as the trigger type, tap ‚ÄúScan‚Äù, and then scan the NFC tag you placed on your Tesla.¬† You can name the tag whatever you want; I called mine ‚ÄúTesla Trunk‚Äù.¬† Choose ‚ÄúRun Immediately‚Äù and leave ‚ÄúNotify When Run‚Äù turned off.
* In the next step, choose ‚ÄúNew Blank Automation‚Äù.¬† Tap ‚ÄúAdd Action‚Äù and search for the Tesla action called ‚ÄúOpen/Close Rear Trunk‚Äù.¬† Tap on the action to add it to your shortcut.¬† There are two parameters for the action: ‚ÄúOpen/Close‚Äù and ‚ÄúChoose Vehicle‚Äù.¬† Set the ‚ÄúOpen/Close‚Äù parameter to ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù and the ‚ÄúChoose Vehicle‚Äù parameter to the vehicle you are setting up.
* Tap on the little arrow icon to show more options for the action and turn off ‚ÄúShow When Run‚Äù.
* Tap on ‚ÄúDone‚Äù to finish your shortcut.¬† Now your Tesla‚Äôs trunk will open when you hold the top of your iPhone near the NFC tag on your Tesla.¬† Try that now to check that the automation works.¬† I find it more reliable to hold the top of my iPhone to the NFC tag while the screen is off and then press the side button to wake the screen.
* When you are ready to open the trunk hands-free, open the shortcuts app, tap the ‚ÄúShortcuts‚Äù tab along the bottom, go to the ‚ÄúAll Shortcuts‚Äù list and tap on the ‚ÄúHands Free Trunk‚Äù shortcut.¬† The shortcut will ask you for a number of seconds to delay until your iPhone will start scanning for the NFC tag.¬† Choose a number based on how long you think it will take you to get to your trunk.¬† After you choose a number, your iPhone will switch to the lock screen and the countdown will begin.¬† Put your iPhone in your pocket in a position that you can line the top of it up with the NFC tag on your Tesla.¬† Once your iPhone plays the notification sound, hold your pocket up to the NFC tag.¬† The trunk should automatically open within about 3 seconds.

**How the shortcut works and how to customize it:**

iOS allows you to scan for NFC tags when your iPhone is awake.¬† This works most reliably when the top of your iPhone is touching an NFC tag and the screen first wakes up.¬† You cannot scan for NFC tags while the screen is off, so this shortcut wakes up your iPhone to scan for a tag in a way that works even when in your pocket.

The shortcut first asks for a number of seconds to wait before scanning.¬† This allows you to choose different lengths depending on how long you think it will take you to walk to your Tesla.¬† After the initial delay, the shortcut plays a default notification sound at full volume and then enters a loop where it continually displays a notification and toggles Airplane Mode.

The notification causes the screen to turn on.¬† However, even though the iPhone normally scans for NFC tags when the screen is turned, it seems like turning on the screen alone via Shortcuts does not cause the same behavior.¬† That‚Äôs why Airplane Mode is also toggled when the notification is displayed, because this combination forces the iPhone to scan for NFC tags.

I have found that toggling Bluetooth also forces the iPhone to scan for NFC tags without the need to use a notification to wake the screen.¬† But toggling Bluetooth will mess with the Tesla Phone Key and might cause issues unlocking the Tesla.

Finally, the shortcut turns Airplane Mode back off and set the volume to 0 after the scanning loop.

If you edit the ‚ÄúHands Free Trunk‚Äù shortcut, there will be a comment at the top describing the following 3 options you will probably want to customize:

*Initial Delay Options*

* This is the number of seconds that the shortcut will pause until the notification sound plays and scanning starts.¬† This pause will start right after you choose an option and your iPhone screen locks.¬† Customize these options based on how long you think it will typically¬†take you to walk to your Tesla before scanning starts.

*Duration of Scan*

* Use this to set the number of seconds that you want to scanning to last.¬† Make this longer so that even if you don‚Äôt reach your Tesla by the end of the Initial Delay, scanning will happen over a longer period of time, giving you more time to reach the NFC tag.

*Delay Between Scans*

* Change this to adjust how much time to pause between turning Airplane Mode off and on.¬† It‚Äôs best to leave a few seconds between so that there‚Äôs time to scan for the tag.¬† You can control how many scans will happen depending on what time you set for Duration of Scan and Delay Between Scans.¬† For example, if you set Duration of Scan to 30 seconds and Delay Between Scans to 3 seconds, your iPhone will scan for the NFC tag approximately 10 times over a 30 second window.

**Quick setup guide for those familiar with iOS Shortcuts:**

* Stick an NFC onto your Tesla at a height where the top of your iPhone can line up with the tag while in your pocket.¬† *Note: the NFC tags I listed do not work when placed on metal.¬† So you will need to place the tag on a section of the Tesla that is plastic, like the bumper.¬† There are NFC tags that do work on metal that you can purchase instead.*
* Create a new Shortcuts automation that triggers and runs without confirmation when the NFC tag is scanned.¬† The only action needed in this automation is one to open your Tesla‚Äôs trunk.¬† Make sure the action has ‚ÄúNotify when run‚Äù turned off.
* Hold the top of your iPhone near the NFC tag on your Tesla and turn on the iPhone screen to check that the automation works.
* Download this shortcut I created called ‚Äú[Hands Free Trunk](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/29f19ada5bc444059394c7c885b38c1a)‚Äú.¬† See above for how the shortcut works.
* Run the shortcut and choose a number of seconds to delay until scanning starts.¬† Your iPhone will then switch to the lock screen.¬† Put your iPhone in your pocket in a position that you can line the top of it up with the NFC tag on your Tesla.¬† After the delay, your iPhone will play the default notification sound.  Once you hear that, hold your pocket up to the NFC tag.¬† The trunk should automatically open within about 3 seconds.

# FAQ

## Can you steal my car?

If you provide vehicle commands and don't use PIN to drive, yes, but that's against my Terms of Service and I am happy with my Model 3 LR. I promise I wont.

## How is Teslemetry secured?

See [https://teslemetry.com/docs/about/security](https://teslemetry.com/docs/about/security)

## Why does this cost money?

Because I need to run servers to do all this, and because Tesla is going to start charging me to offer this service.

## Will you support X in the future?

I fully support Home Assistant, and the Python and NodeJS libraries. I provide best effort support for Homebridge, and in the future NodeRed. I will add support for other platforms based on demand.

"""Not driven by human"" markings?This is not strictly Tesla specific, but this community appears like the right place to bring it up. With Waymo and other sensor-based self driving systems, it's been quite obvious that the car is not driven by a human by just looking at it. But with Tesla insisting on going with cameras only, and sensors likely becoming smaller over time, should these cars not be marked with something to indicate the car may not be operated by a human driver? Similar to how some countries mandate special signs on vehicles driven by learners, as well as novice or very senior drivers?

As a potential buyer of a used 2022+ Tesla Model X, I'd appreciate honest feedback from current owners. Due to depreciation concerns, purchasing a new EV isn't feasible for me. With two small children, I require a vehicle with a third row, and the Model X's captain chairs are a significant advantage.

Setting aside brand preferences and politics, I'd love to know:

1. What motivated you to sell or consider replacing your Model X?
2. If you were to choose another EV with comparable software capabilities to Tesla, which model would you opt for?

Your insights will greatly help me make an informed decision.

For reference, I am also considering Taycan and Escalade. ",11-19-2024

I am hoping to sell but I know it will be tricky since I still owe money on it and last I heard they don‚Äôt retain value as well as they used to. Is this still true?

If I were to attempt to get another car would I need to get a loan that covers what I still owe plus the value of whatever car I end up choosing?

For those of you that have already jumped ship, what did you land on? If I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôm leaning away from electric and potential choosing a Prius.

If you look at the body damage there is a slight scratch on the paint in the middle. The body is slightly dented. I took this to my regular body shop who does our Mercedes cars and he said give or take about a 1,000 Euros. But he could not do the work because he is not an official Tesla place and hence cannot do the work, or will not do the work. He also indicated only get it done in a Tesla shop because of the warranty.

So I asked for two quotes and the answer was 2,380 Euros and 2,550 CHF. Are you fracken kidding me? We always fix our own little dents because our deductible is about 750 Euros. In most cases we are always below 1,500 Euros. My wifes Mercedes GLA who had a torn fender that needed replacing cost 1,350ish CHF. And that was done by Mercedes Switzerland, not exactly a cheap haven.

I said to my wife, nope never again a Tesla. She agreed because those are outrageous prices and if we have to go via the insurance our already expensive insurance will continue to go through the roof. As she said I will drive around with a dented car until the battery completely dies.

"The current EV Market sucks if you want a sports sedan that is affordableRight now outside of Tesla, your only options if you want a sports sedan are in the ultra luxury category. The closest cars to the model 3 are the polestar 2 and ioniq 6, and unfortunately they both have similar issues to the Tesla. The ioniq 6 has touch buttons which are pretty annoying. And the polestar 2 is really cramped inside. Then there's the issue of the polestar 2 is really heavy and can't get 300 miles of range. It's so annoying that all the legacy auto makers are copying Tesla for interior design. Oddly enough there's plenty of gas cars out there that still have tons of buttons. Right now I'm planning on sticking to gas cars till we get EV sedans that are fast and have lots of buttons. But I overall feel hopeless that will ever happen.

"Elon snaps back at ZOOX co-founder, but fails to adress the issue!In a recent exchange, Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson criticized Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology at TechCrunch Disrupt, calling it unreliable for driverless use. Elon Musk fired back, dismissively claiming Zoox would have failed without Amazon‚Äôs support. Instead of addressing the critique about Tesla's hardware and safety concerns, Musk opted for a personal jab. This sparked reactions noting the irony, as Tesla had past bailouts, and his non-rebuttal hinted at Levinson's valid points.

"So how many of you are getting / have gotten rid of your Teslas based on the behavior of the person at the helm of that company? Be honest. Of course, the title applies to several owners here on this sub but chime in even if you aren‚Äôt an owner because you decided to not become an owner for wherever reasons. 

My personal standpoint is that I buy a car to buy a car. I‚Äôm not associating myself with any personalities just by buying a car with their name associated with it on paper, and I‚Äôll still criticize its maker and CEO for their words and actions. Additionally, not everything media portrays is contextual. We all know that by now. It‚Äôs a profit driven business. 

And let‚Äôs be honest, Tesla as a concept is not Elon‚Äôs brains. If anything, some of his corner cutting decisions have made the car worse. Being in Technology myself, I am rewarding the real engineers. 

I also criticize the car daily for some key missing features and overall flimsy feel. But I still think it‚Äôs a pretty good car and better than many in its class. Now, if I had the money to throw away, I‚Äôd probably want something different next time around like an R1S just as a breath of fresh air as Tesla are getting stale and gaining Uber cab reputation. But I do appreciate how far along Tesla‚Äôs UI, Infotainment, and infrastructure elements are compared to other EV offerings, let alone traditional ICE cars. So yes, it is hard to leave the Tesla ecosystem for another EV (Rivian slowly becoming a viable albeit expensive alternative)

I just feel like we have a lot of owners here of the brand who think the same. And some who don‚Äôt. But this sub is meant to be critical of everything Tesla and everything Elon, so I‚Äôm also trying to gauge just how far current owners are willing to go to boycott or, well, just talk smack while they drive their Teslas, which is fine. 

I am just curious to know your viewpoints without placing any judgments. So, please stay kind and refrain from personal attacks. ",10-30-2024

Wondering why so much range was lost in 3 years when Tesla says the battery degrades 1% yearly?

I see so much conflicting information. Sometimes it says that it‚Äôs an EPA estimate and nothing to do with battery health.

"For me, the biggest sell of the Tesla is the charging network. How close are we to getting reliable charging for other cars?Recently rented a Kia Niro EV when I was in California, and charging it was a huge pain in the ass, even in an area with ostensibly a lot of charging infrastructure. When I've borrowed a relative's Tesla, the charging infrastructure made it really easy. What's the progress on getting other cars on that network? Or expanding non-Tesla networks? I see all these charging achievements being touted, but my personal experience has been disappointing. I have a 2014 Chevy Volt and trying to charge it ANYWHERE is a coin flip. I'm even someone who will really plan ahead and I'm willing to walk way out of my way to charge it, and I'd say I'm able to charge as planned less than 20% of the time.

I rarely need a car so I'll drive my Volt into the ground before I buy a new one, but it's hard for me to recommend non-Tesla EVs to other people, particularly in cities like mine where you can't really charge at home, without a fast charging network like Tesla's. 

What has everyone else's experience been with your non-Tesla EVs? Have you been able to use Tesla's charging network? Do you have adequate charging options, particularly if you can't charge at home?

Also for the record, I put a down payment on a Model 3 when it was first announced and cancelled it when the Pedophile thing happened, I fuckin hate that dude.",10-24-2024
"Elon Musk Confirms There‚Äôs No $25,000 Tesla EV On The Way",10-24-2024
"Elon's final play before he leaves Tesla?TLDR: Yes, I lost money on Tesla puts. Yes, the margin improvement/cost reduction is impressive. But the golden carrot he put in front of investors faces regarding a bright Tesla future is just bullshit and only serves for Musks well payed exit, if Trump wins. Then he can easily argue, that he has to leave Tesla because duty calls in the government and he never actually has to deliver. So OTM call (280) till/after Trumps win and after that put options once he announces, that he works for Trump now.

First things first, margin improvement, free cash flow and improved cost of production is very impressive and shows that the core business is doing well.

Nevertheless, this does not correlate anyhow with the stock price. So lets talk the golden future laied out in the earnings call.

* There is no way the HW3 will be able to be used as a robotaxi, he finally said that.
* They are already testing ride hailing/robotaxis with drivers --> whats the news here?! Its like any other Tesla with FSD where a driver is sitting behind the wheele.
* How the f\* does he project 20-30% growth in 2025:
   * All factories are close to max. capacity. Mexico factory is on hold, Shanghai might start soon. BUT: The economy in china is f\*. Tensions with Taiwan are rising and could escalate.
   * US sales are down.
   * The economy and EV business in Europe is struggling.
   * The 25k vehicle is canceled --> no growth here.
   * The Cybertruck is a niche product for the US.
   * There are no details regarding the affordable models. If actually starting in Q1 2025 those can only be stripped down existing models. I really doubt that people will go for those cars.
* No news on licences for robotaxis:
   * It is extremely risky to bet on the no stearingwheel/only camera approach. Everybody else uses multiple sensors and still faces situation they cant handle, especially not legally if shit hits the fan.
   * The legal issue regarding robotaxis is not solved and not in Teslas hands to solve.
   * Volume production for Robotaxis in 2026 might sound nice but as stated before, you don't know if Tesla is actually allowed to deploy them.

All those points combined with fact, that he even managed to give multiple contradicting statements during the earnings call leave me with following conclusion:

Due to the financial mess he is in with his Twitter purchase and all those unachievable promises he prepares his golden exit. He wants to push the stock as high as possible before the Trump election and will then leave since the government will call and he is destined to serve America. This way he can solve his financial mess with Twitter while saving his face. So long till the election and short after that.",10-24-2024

"Alternatives to model 3Hi!  
Im looking at getting my first EV.   
My budget is around what a new model 3 costs. Ive been test driving model 3, huyndai Kona, VW id.4, and a Renault megane e-tech.

  
I have not tried KIA as im not attracted to how they look, at all.

The renault megane e-tech is my favourite, but the range and space compared to a model 3 is just 2 different worlds.

Ive never been a fan of tesla, but nothing comes close to a teslas range and efficiency for money. Looking at specs nothing else than a model 3 makes sense tbh... are teslas as bad as some people make them? are they as unreliable as people around here make it sound?

"What if Optimus is for the military?Optimus is what Tesla calls their humanoid-shaped robot with human-like hands that can do human-like things when a human is remote controlling it.  If this thing had good enough AI then it could basically be a Terminator (but a lot slower, weaker, and less tanky).  Instead it has no AI at all and is just remote control.  That means you could stick a standard military rifle into the human-like hands and send the things off to clear out a city without risking the lives of soldiers, who would all be sitting back at base.  When a robot gets 'killed' that soldier just starts controlling another one...and no worries that they will rise up and wipe out humanity.  Sure, they would be less effective than real troops but you could basically deploy as many as the total number of troops you have worldwide to any given location and just overwhelm anyone with numbers, then deploy all those same troops halfway around the world with almost no notice.  You could even bump up your numbers by gamifying it and getting civilians to control them.  Obviously Boston Dynamics or Honda could do this a whole lot better, but they haven't been giving truckloads of money to Trump so they wouldn't get the contract.

"Long Term Reliability I've been driving a 2008 Honda Civic for probably the last 7 years, car had 95k miles when I bought it and now has 245k miles with almost zero maintenance other than routine stuff. I've recently gotten more established in my career and am in a position to upgrade since the Civic is starting to really show its age now. 

  I've considered Accord hybrids and a few others but recently started looking at Teslas because I really like the looks of the 2024 refresh (model 3). Me and the wife went and test drove one at Tesla of Knoxville Saturday and I was blown away. The interior and acceleration are insane in my eyes coming from a 2008 Civic the Tesla seems like a spaceship. 

  My only major concern is long term reliability, I'm wanting to buy new so I'll be covered by the warranty for as long as possible. It's a bit alarming though how many post I see about stuff as simple as door gasket material messing up on cars that aren't even 3 years old yet and all these model 3s that are having issues with less than 100k miles. 

  Pretty much my question is I wanna hear from the people that have had little to no issues, if you have 100k+ mile and have had no problems I'd like the hear about your experience. Also one more thing what's up with all the 2021s that are having battery issues, are the battery's in the 2021s different from other years or is the same kind of battery used in the 2024s.

It seems to confirm the idea that all of Elon's activities are in search of and support of SpaceX, but also that the approach behind Robotaxi and SpaceX has virtues and is potentially very smart. Though it attempts to cover the positive points of Tesla's choices fairly, I think it inadvertently makes a strong case for booting Elon. 

On the other hand, the article finally explains to me at least, why his board may be enamored enough of him to keep him on.

The money paragraph: ""The Tesla bet, though, is that Waymo‚Äôs approach ultimately doesn‚Äôt scale and isn‚Äôt generalizable to true Level 5, while starting with the dream ‚Äî true autonomy ‚Äî leads Tesla down a better path of relying on nothing but AI, fueled by data and fine-tuning that you can only do if you already have millions of cars on the road. That is the connection to SpaceX and what happened this weekend: if you start with the dream, then understand the cost structure necessary to achieve that dream, you force yourself down the only path possible, forgoing easier solutions that don‚Äôt scale for fantastical ones that do.""",10-15-2024

"My Model Y is stressful to drive.Did a 90 mi round trip drive yesterday, I had four phantom breaking events, one with a guy right behind me. On top of that I had two warnings to take control immediately, complete with blaring alarms, and both times with my hands literally on the steering wheel. 
This was in just TACC because I find FSD just a white hot mess.  Everytime I think I can relax a little, an alarm goes off or the brakes slam on.  Not what I was promised, and not something you experience in a demo drive either.  It's only when living with it day to day the negatives really shine through.

I'm asking Tesla about a return, but barring that I'll likely sell at a loss soon and go back to an old-fashioned car with regular cruise control and limited safety systems.  I'm about 3 weeks into ownership and so far 100% of the stressors have been safety system related.  The EV portion of the Model Y is simply amazing, great efficiency and incredible power delivery. It's the safety inclusions that make it stressful to drive, the irony.

I had a Chevy Bolt for 4 years so EV driving is not new to me, but the Bolt had none of these safety or driver assist annoyances, it allowed me to simply drive it.
I just get the impression that the Model Y doesn't seem to want me to drive it, like it just wants to stay plugged into a charger and never move.

This can be tough for Tesla fan-boys to hear, but the car is simply not everyone's cup of tea.",10-13-2024

"The Robotaxi and how Musk is beaten by mathSo the robotaxi costs $30,000 and according to Musk, it will cost riders as low as $0.2 per mile. It consumes 18 kWh per 100 miles and has a range of 200 miles.

So essentially if you use it as a robotaxi you can do 150,000 miles before you exceed the initial cost of buying one. At an average annual mileage of 13,500 miles that means you can use robotaxis for 11 years until you spent $30,000. 

Now let's factor in electricity. By design, a robotaxi will rarely charge at home. Most will be charged on Superchargers. If we assume an average cost of $0.40 (can be much higher during peak times) per kWh those 150,000 miles would have cost us around $10,800. That gets us another 54,000 miles when we simply order one on demand. l

If we factor in insurance at $2,000 per year, that's $22,000 over eleven years, which gives us another 110,000 miles if we order it on demand.

So the actual cost if you own one and use it is $62,800 for 11 years. Versus $30,000 to just order it on demand for 11 years. And you don't have any benefits. You  still have to clean it if you own it. You still can't leave your personal belongings inside if you own it and intend to share it as a robotaxi.

So let's say you own it. One thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the battery in an EV, the more charging cycles you have, meaning it simply dies faster over the same distance. The robotaxi will also be almost exclusively fast charged to minimise downtime. That also means higher degredation.

Going by a large taxi operator, the average mileage of a taxi that is running double shifts (or 24/7) is 70,000 miles per year. 40 % of that time is spent without passengers. That means 42,000 miles per year can be done with passengers. At $0.20 per mile that's potential revenue of $8.400 per year. At the same time those 70,000 miles would cost the owner $5,000 in electricity alone when charged publicly. Insurance is another $2,000. Now you are already at $7,000 cost to earn $8,400 a year. You spent $30k to make $1,400 a year - before cleaning cost, before Tesla's share to get riders to your robotaxi. Before new tires once or twice a year. Before paying any rates for that car. Before taxes. It's quite obvious that at $0.20 per mile the service would be wildly unprofitable. The actual minimum cost would be $1+ to somehow turn this into a profitable operation. And then they aren't competitive with busses anymore, which Musk himself said would cost $1 per mile.

It's a bad idea all around. It's also impossible to use that robotaxi for handicapped people, for groups of more than two, for transporting some Ikea furniture back home and loads of other common taxi use cases. So it can't even reach the same 100 % of the potential customers.

You also can't pay an autonomous taxi $10 more to entice it to reach the destination a bit faster.

Why low profile tires? Its a taxi not a sports car ffs, why would you want to feel every lump in the road?

Why butterfly doors? Good luck getting out in a tight spot or an area with low clearance.

Why are the seats so low to the ground and why is the roof so low? Anyone who has gotten into and out of sedans and SUVs/vans knows exactly how much easier the latter is on the back and joints.

This feels to me like a clever joke, El\*n M\*sk was like, ok how do we make this as bad as possible, just to mess with everybody and he's laughing the whole ride home.

The Model Y would make a better robotaxi because it has more seating, seats at a nice height, roof at a nice height, and higher profile tires for a softer ride.

Its funny that Waymo, which makes robotaxis which actually function, just uses Jaguars and Hyundais and doesn't worry about designing their own car.",10-12-2024

Tesla needed to do five things on Thursday: show a robotaxi, discuss entry to service, discuss safety data, provide details of its business model, and offer an Easter Egg. Tesla hit three of those five.

As for the three it hit, there wasn't much any discussion about how Tesla would enter service or details about what regulatory hurdles the company faces and how it plans to overcome them. For the two that Tesla missed, the lack of any new safety or driving data was glaring.""",10-11-2024

"Launch Event Theatre: An Elon Musk ProductionWe really have Steve Jobs and Apple to thank for this mess. While companies have long tried to announce new products with big events, Apple had a nice run where these events really became EVENTS in the minds of the general public. 

The difference of course is that Apple announced the product when it was built and ready to go, and would be in stores on a set date (not a perpetual ‚Äú18 months‚Äù into the future). 

Elon has realized that there‚Äôs a segment of the population that is now addicted to the show and doesn‚Äôt seem to mind that the product never arrives or when it does, it never lives up to the promises made at the launch event. Tesla Semi exists, but it was supposed to be replacing trains and truck drivers by driving in automated convoys by now. 

It‚Äôs crazy that tomorrow he‚Äôs going to announce a product that isn‚Äôt finished (but definitely will be in ‚Äú18 months‚Äù) and people are going to get a big chubby one for it and buy Tesla stock on Friday. 

FSD still needs major improvements to drive without a driver, and many experts believe it will never happen with cameras alone. If a city allows it to be deployed before it‚Äôs at Waymo levels of safety, people are going to die and it will be a disaster for Tesla stock. I don‚Äôt understand how investors can‚Äôt see this reality. 

And even if it eventually works and gets approved for use, why are we pretending like the taxi business is the same something like software?  When you make something like Microsoft office and dominate the market, you can make billions of copies of it for nothing more than your additional tech support costs. 

Taxis still exist in the physical world and therefore have physical limitations.  I‚Äôve seen articles taking about how a robotaxi can go 24 hours a day unlike a human. Oh really? And the battery charges on what, magic?  

Cars wear out per mile, and that taxi fleet will need maintenance and upkeep. Tires, brakes, batteries, worn out interiors, cleaning, charging stations. A car moving continuously 18 hours per day at 30 mph travels almost 200,000 miles in a year. If it costs $80,000 for the car alone (Waymos are $180,000) it‚Äôs race against time for the car to pay for itself before it has to be replaced. 

Most people use taxis for two reasons: to and from the airport and when drinking to avoid killing someone. The rest of the time they want their own car if they can afford it. Is it possible that kids today will accept not owning a car when they are adults? Yes, but now we‚Äôre talking decades before individual car ownership becomes rare. And if we do get there, I‚Äôm betting that Tesla is not the dominant player in that market. ",10-09-2024

Unfortunately my lease was expiring in September and Tesla was not able to provide parts in time to the body shop. Their solution? Just extend the lease and keep paying them! 

Here I am 6 weeks later, Tesla has sent wrong part again and they are still telling me nothing they can do and I will just have to keep extending the lease!

No matter how much I explain that I can neither return the car, or repair the car due to thier own inability to send new parts, everyone I speak to basically just says ""nothing we can do"".

"Review: 6 Weeks in a Tesla - WTF?!I'll preface this by saying I've never been the type to seek out reddit pages to rant, but my recent experience has turned me into one of those people. I was never an ""Anti-Tesa"" person. My opinional disagreements stem from my personal belief that hybrids are the realistic future unless this country embraces nuclear energy. I would enjoy trolling the type of Tesla owner that acts obnoxious that they are single handedly saving mankind with their Tesla but don't have an answer when you ask them where electricity comes from. 

I had been in a couple different Teslas previously but I just finished a 6 week extended rental of a 23 Model 3 while my car was in the body shop. I don't think I can encounter anything in my life that was so incredibly hyped and turned out so incredibly horrible. 

Now, I'll admit, I was in a rental (likely) base level Model 3 long range, so I'm willing to admit that my experience might have been slightly more positive in a higher end model. That being said, I am now convinced more than ever that the Tesla enthusiasts that obnoxious talk up these cars so much are nothing but rabid fan boys that are completely blind to what a piece of crap this car is. 

Despite being their ""lower"" model car, the MSRP on model I had (when new) started around 40k+. I've seen used models of the exact  i had with the same mileage (16k) for about 30k+. What I experience for a car of that price blew my mind! 

First, when I picked up the car, the drivers door made a loud pop noise when opening in. Fearing the car they gave me must have been in an accident, I asked for a different car. They showed me 2 others that made a similar sound. The rental manager informed me that most of the Tesla they've had make that noise and it was just a ""Tesla thing"". 
Onto the famous Tesla build quality. The cheap plastic panels that creek with the slightest touch. The horrible faux pleather seats and wheel. I personally hate the ipad knock off UI that you have to use for EVERYTHING, but I'll admit that is a personal preference and give that a pass. The sounds this car made with every slightest bump in the road made me feel like I was driving a 2000 Mitsu Mirage. 

While the car has some very unique and (formally) ahead of its time features that I found to be completely novelty and largely useless. (Disco lights and romance mode? Seriously?). After my extended test drive I firmly believe that the fan boys point to these unique gimmicks to cover the fact that a 40k car doesn't have many super basic features you'll find on base model Hyundai's, Hondas, or any other brand.  

First, refusing to integrate Car Play and Android auto in laughable. Its like driving a car from early 2000 when bluetooth audio was a technological gift from God lol. The built in navigation (like the rest of the car) is atrocious. No ventilated seats. Oh a glass roof, that's kind of cool, but it doesnt open lmao. The road noise was something I haven't experience on any car in the last decade. The loud whistling coming from the windows has me constantly checking that the windows were rolled up. They were, of course. I suppose windows that don't seal is part of their fresh air feature. 

I see ""Full self driving"" and think okay, this should be cool. Here is that awesome technological I've heard about. I almost pissed myself laughing when I realized it's nothing more than adaptive cruise control, which I had standard on my 2016 Civic and is not only standard, but far superior only my current 22 Honda and my wife's 22 Hyundai (not to mention insanely significantly better build quality, interior and interior materials).  Outside of engaging ""full self driving"" which seemed to mandate cruise control, the car doesn't even have active lane keep assist!ü§Ø Which is not only standard on my Honda and Wife's Hyndai, it works SIGNIFICANTLY better than teslas full self driving. I start to veer out of my lane and my Honda/Hyundai automatically pulls me back into place. Not to mention the active lane keep assist works at any speed and isnt something that requires cruise control at high way speeda. When adaptive cruise control is on, the car continues to steer itself, accurately, through some very strong curves and bends in the road. This Teslas FSD would disengage at the slightest bend in the road. 

I could go on and on but I've wasted enough of my time on this, frankly, really shitty car lol. 40k+ for that car is absolutely laughable. 

If electric cars are your thing, that's great. But in 2024, every single major car company has Electric cars/SUVs that are infinitely better than these overhyped cheap pieces of junk Elon is making. 

I'm trying to be objective in my review because I really didn't have any prior prejudice against Tesla prior to this 6 week rental. Maybe other than I tend to find a disproportionate amount of Tesla owners I've met to have this douchey arrogance but, to be fair, you can find that anywhere. 
So, what am I missing? Why does this company have such a large cult-like following of enthusiasts? Because what I just drove for 1.5 months was a complete POS and the entire time I wish I had taken the new Elantra or Altima they had but I wanted to see what the hype was about.

"Safety Score and premium score don‚Äôt match, Tesla Insurance hung up on me. I've had tesla insurance since April of this year, and just renewed for an additional six months since its been a good experience, until today. Historically, my premium has been aligned with my safety score (I live in Texas, so whatever Cali has going on doesn't apply to me). Up until this last week, my premium has updated in accordance to my safety score live. However the night before my October bill was finalized, I noticed that although my score was 91, my premium was only for a score of 90. Not a huge deal as a few extra bucks won't kill me, but I took screenshots and sent it over to the Tesla Insurance Support email. Currently my score is now 93, but my premium for November is still showing 90. I have gotten no response, not even an acknowledgment of my email. So this morning, when I had a meeting cancel, I said ""screw it"" and called the number for Tesla Insurance, willing to wait the long hold time. When I got ahold of an agent, and explained the situation, she completely disregarded my concern, and kept saying ""the premium is just an estimate"". I confirmed that I was aware of that, and patiently explained my concern was that the safety score seems completely independent of my premium, and historically that has not been the case. Her response then became ""thank you for that feedback."" Again, I patiently articulated that it wasn't feedback, it was an issue having a financial impact on their customer, and that this didn't align with my previous months. At this point she kept saying there was nothing she could do and I should just wait for an email response (which is obviously just going to say the same thing). At this point I asked if I could speak to a supervisor, she put me on a brief hold (at which point I felt like it might be of value of record the conversation for my own records), and what you hear is her saying a higher up will reach out eventually, and hanging up on me. So yeah, at this point all that good experience is gone and don't really have confidence in their ability to provide the basic function of their variable insurance offering. So if you see a red M3 going dukes a hazard in Texas, its me bc regardless of my score I'm paying for a 90 I guess.",09-26-2024

"NYT article highlights a $22,445.72 hotel payment paid by Musk's security staff.I was reading the recent article on Musk's security apparatus via the NYT and came across something very strange.

It was a segment where they said his security guys sometimes did errands for him, including paying a $22,445.72 hotel bill on his behalf for family and staff in 2016. 

This I find very weird, because firstly its a very high hotel bill. But also why is he entrusting his security staff with such a big payment?

But also, the bill was for **Musk's family and staff's accommodation at a luxury hotel.**

Now either, Musk is personally paying out for his staff's accommodation luxury accommodation which I find unlikely.   
  
Or Tesla shareholders are paying for Musk, his staff and his family to live it up in Hong Kong in a luxury hotel.

"ApologiesTo the people and communities my choices have affected,

I want to extend a sincere apology for my role in supporting a vehicle and a vision that, on reflection, endangers more than it benefits. As a Tesla Cybertruck owner, I recognize the inherent risks my vehicle poses to others‚Äîits oversized, steel-framed design isn‚Äôt just a personal choice or a statement, but a mobile hazard that instills fear among families, cyclists, and pedestrians who share the streets.

When I first made the decision to drive a Cybertruck, I was drawn to its technological promise, its power, and its defiance of convention. But I now understand that this choice contributes to a culture of excess and dominance that dismisses the safety of others and overlooks the responsibility we all share on the road. My vehicle, with its armored frame, presents real dangers‚Äîits weight, dimensions, and visibility challenges turn it into an unyielding force that doesn‚Äôt belong in public streets. I see now that its aesthetic of invincibility, once so appealing, translates directly into risks for anyone who happens to be in its path.

I apologize as well for supporting the egotism and misplaced priorities that brought this vehicle to life. By buying into this vision, I have, in part, endorsed a mindset that values spectacle over common sense and dismisses the impact on the very communities that are meant to benefit from innovation. My choice has, in effect, contributed to a brand that places personal ambition over public safety, technology over human-centered progress.

I know that no amount of regret can undo the dangers my Cybertruck may still pose, but I commit to seeking safer, more responsible transportation. I apologize for the harm and fear my vehicle represents to so many, and I will do my part to ensure the roads are safer for everyone.

Sincerely,
A non-tesla owner that made a template you actual owners should use.

>*We were driving on the freeway yesterday September 3rd at 9:30pm and my passenger side door swung open while on the entrance ramp to highway 24. My infant was sitting in that passenger side in her carseat and thankfully she wasnt injured. A car could have collided with that door or it could have hit anything outside resulting in extreme damage, injury, or death. Upon inspection of the door latch, the door latch is almost completely unhinged. The screw cam off, and the latch simply swivels and does not lock the door or hold it in place. We had to drive home with our hand physically holding the door closed. My driver side door also seems to not be fully latching - though it is not in as bad condition. But upon driving it, you can feel an airgap with the sound at higher speeds which suggests to me that this door latch is also at extreme risk of failure. These two doors are the only ones commonly used by us. But given they are both seemingly failing, my guess is that all four door latches are defective and at immediate risk of causing harm, injury, or death to those Cybertrucks on the road with the same latch.*

"I'm guessing from the posts I've seen on Reddit that most, if not all, of the Wankpanzer owners who are using FSD and posting about it haven't bothered to RT the FM.If they had they might have come across the [limitations and warnings](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/cybertruck/en_us/GUID-E5FF5E84-6AAC-43E6-B7ED-EC1E9AEB17B7.html#GUID-4EE67389-5F55-46D0-9559-90F31949660A) section of the [Cybertruck Owner's Manual](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/cybertruck/en_us/) (Where Tesla actually refers to the feature as ""Full Self Driving (Supervised)""). Here are some highlights from the section dealing with Full Self Driving (Supervised):

>**Warning**  
**Always remember that¬†Full Self-Driving (Supervised)¬†(also known as Autosteer on City Streets) does not make¬†Cybertruck¬†autonomous and requires a fully attentive driver who is ready to take immediate action at all times.**

A fully attentive driver. No napping, no gaming, no watching YouTube or TikTok, no texting, no posting on Twitter, or rubbing one out, or rubbing one out with one hand while you post to Twitter with the other. Nope! Nope! A thousand times nope! You're supposed to keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel, just like *The Doors* told you to in [Roadhouse Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgQg3J7xU1k).

>Warning  
Full Self-Driving (Supervised)¬†is a hands-on feature. Keep your hands on the¬†steering wheel¬†at all times, be mindful of road conditions and surrounding traffic, and always be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death. It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with the limitations of¬†Full Self-Driving (Supervised)¬†and the situations in which it may not work as expected.

""Keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times..."" which I assume means that you shouldn't be like [this lunkhead](https://www.reddit.com/r/CyberStuck/comments/1gf9kk3/this_guy_is_the_last_thing_someone_is_going_to/). Remember, no posting on Twitter, or rubbing one out or rubbing one out with one hand while posting to Twitter with the other.

And then there's this section:

>Warning  
**Cybertruck¬†may quickly and suddenly** ***make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention.***

>The list above represents only a fraction of the possible scenarios that can cause¬†Full Self-Driving (Supervised)¬†to make sudden maneuvers and behave unexpectedly. In fact,¬†Cybertruck¬†can suddenly swerve even when driving conditions appear normal and straight-forward. Stay alert and always pay attention to the roadway so you can anticipate the need to take corrective action as early as possible. Remember that this is an early access feature that must be used with extra caution.

This is the one that really gets me. ""Cybertruck may quickly make unexpected maneuvers or mistakes that require immediate driver intervention"". Uh, hello, I thought that this software was supposed to be better and safer at driving than I am. If I have to constantly pay attention to it and take control if it suddenly glitches out then it isn't a safer driver than I am. Buying FSD (Supervised) for a Tesla is like hiring an expensive chauffeur who says ""I'm a much better driver than you are, but you need to constantly pay attention to me because I may take a massive hit of acid and wash it down with [purple drink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(drug)) while I'm driving. So you might have to take over if I start hallucinating and dissociating.""

This is such bullshit! Imagine if Microsoft Excel came with a warning that said ""Warning, sometimes Excel just plain fucks up and doesn't do math properly. You should be prepared to check all of the calculations in your spreadsheet."" If you had to do this then Microsoft Excel wouldn't be making your life any easier and you wouldn't use it. But Tesla wants you to pay $8,000 for this lousy software and then constantly supervise it in case it shits the bed potentially causing a dangerous situation. Now that's bad enough but what makes it worse is that these submissive dimwits are actually doing it. They are actually paying $8,000 to work as beta testers on seriously flawed software.",10-31-2024

He also explains that nobody chose this approach before because Elon is a genius and so only he can pull it off.

Fast-forward to 2024 and all that is left of the exoskeleton is a few glued on stainless panels that have a tendency to fly off. But hey, that Leon-guy is still a genius, I guess.",10-29-2024

"Would You Trust a Doctor Who Drives a Cybertruck?I live in a small town that thinks it is a city.  We have a pretty decent hospital and some good doctors and..... some not so good.  Think, *Caribbean medical school*.  So for major medical problem, other than emergencies, we drive 40 minutes to the big city.

Anyway, I was taking a friend to have minor foot surgery and I had to wait while it was done and then drive him home because of the anesthesia (and sit with him for the night as well).  They finished the operation and told me to drive to the patient pickup area.  So I got in the car and was leaving the parking lot when a cyberschmuck in a cybertruck comes roaring in (hospital zone, 25 mph, right?) and nearly clips me.

I have my windows down so I give him the ""thumbs down"" sign that was recommended here on this forum.  Apparently that triggered him.  *Snowflakes*, amirite?

So I drive over to the patient pickup area and he zooms around to cut me off and I drive around him (I have a normal-sized car for daily driving) and out of impulse, give him the bird (NOT recommended by this forum!).

He pulls in behind me and gets out of the thing and accosts me.  ""I'm Doctor so-and-so and I work at this hospital and you can't give me the bird!  I'm calling security!""  So he tromps off, leaving his dumpster blocking the driveway to patient pickup.  I'm fairly confident ""security"" will laugh in his face.

A few minutes later, he returns, red-faced.  Apparently security gave him the bird as well.  He starts trying to lecture me and I cut him off.  ""You're a very insecure person."" I said.  He said, ""why do you say that?"" and I relied, ""Because you can't admit you made a $100,000 mistake!""

He got all huffy and said, ""Well,  you are just jealous because you can't afford one!""  

I said, ""I can afford one, I just choose not to.""  I could afford one, and pay cash for it.  I could literally afford 21 of them, at least according the Merill's ""net worth calculator"" this morning.  But I'm retired and need that money to live on, not squander on rapidly depreciating assets.

As he walked away, I said, ""Besides, I already have a King Ranch"" but I don't think he heard me.  It is nearly a decade old and other than tires, a battery, and oil changes (and a $150 sunroof repair I did myself) it has never broken down, left me stranded, or needed towing.  I don't drive it to the store or the hospital, that would be stupid.  I only use it to tow my camper and occasionally haul things.  That's really the only reason to have a big pickup truck.  Personal transportation?  No.

That being said, the Ford came with a paint job.   It isn't stainless steel, but aluminum - with a steel frame rated for 11,500 lbs (max tow package).  Spare tire included, too - not a $3000 option. And it fits *under* the bed.  No recalls, no rocking seats, no blown motors, no trim falling off.  Say what you want about Ford quality, it is miles above Tesla.

As for the ""doctor"" it scares me a bit that someone who has such poor judgement is allowed to care for patients.  I mean, I wouldn't trust this guy to mow my lawn, much less treat my body.  Road-raging patients *at your place of employment* is just icing on the cake.  Oh, and he was about 100lbs overweight.  A doctor!

Would you go to a doctor who drives a cybertruck?  A lawyer?  A dentist?  A plumber?

Not me.

This is adjacent to Gwinnett Place Mall where Stranger Things filmed the ""Starcourt Mall"" scenes. Plenty of open land so a giant parking deck is puzzling. ",10-06-2024

I‚Äôm not 100% certain, but the prototype possibly had better parts, components and manufacturing and they only had to build that one. 

Leon said building 1 is easy, building them in mass is hard. So that gives you the idea these things are not only POS to build, but also to maintain.

If you look at the parts and manufacturing it‚Äôs cheap garbage. The parts look like they were made in China, that‚Äôs probably an insult to China. BYD actually makes good products.

I don‚Äôt know how long Tesla can keep this up but unless they are making tons of money on each one (which I doubt) the recalls, and ridiculous depreciation would kill this thing unless it‚Äôs just pure Fanboyism.

What an awful POS vehicle though.

Musk didn't create this vehicle for earth he created for it our future on Mars. 

Gravity on Mars is slightly over 1/3 that of the earth and guess what, the toothpick thin suspension components are more than strong enough to hold up the cybertruck when it weighs 2/3 less...genius

It also doesn't rain on Mars, so no software crashes, no wet truck beds and no leaks coming through the giant oversized glass windshield/roof...genius

Lastly thanks to all those stainless steel panels the owners, who we would all be happy to see sent to Mars, now have easily accessible shovels and axes and tent poles and walls. They just need to gently tug on the body panels to pull them off and they can start building a colony...genius

"Buy a CuckTruck, Get Cucked by the Universe. When purchasing a CuckTruck the first you‚Äôll be greeted is your CuckTruck looking all dirty with it not being cleaned up and looking brand new with the cost of $100k. 

Second, when you show up at home your wife will be looking disappointed when you could‚Äôve put a down payment on a beautiful new house. She will be questioning every purchase you make from now on. 

Then 2 days later after shelling out $500 for a new charging station after installation fees and taxes you come to your new CuckTruck and it‚Äôs bricked. You called Tesla and wait on hold for 4 hours as Tesla doesn‚Äôt want to deal with you. 6 hours later, after you could‚Äôve been at work you arrived at the Tesla dealership where they tell you, you have to wait 4-6 weeks for it to be repaired. 

8 weeks has passed and you went on to Twitter to beg Elon to fix your truck and state many times over in your tweets that you love the truck. Elon doesn‚Äôt reply to you. And 2 weeks after your CuckTruck is ready to be picked up, thinking Elon has heard you. 

On the way home from Tesla, you accidentally hit a pothole filled with water from last night‚Äôs heavy rain storm and the red screen of death appears. And you have no choice to wait another 2 hours on hold with Tesla. 

Another 2 weeks goes by and you got your CuckTruck back. However, Tesla states that you will have to pay for the repairs due to it not being covered by the warranty. You get home and get berated by your wife that she hates the CuckTruck and doesn‚Äôt want to see it anymore. You beg and plead with her at your love for this ‚Äútruck‚Äù. She gives you an ultimatum, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me or the CuckTruck!‚Äù

Begrudgingly, you post it on FB Marketplace at $100k and it‚Äôs just people asking questions about your decisions in life. A month goes by, you drop the price by $5000 stating you know what you got and no low ball offers. 

Weeks goes by and still no buyers, so you stick a for sale sign on the back of your CuckTruck hoping for some to buy it as you keep taking it for joyrides. Still nothing. Your wife gets more frustrated that you cannot sell the vehicle that you‚Äôve noticed your wife has changed in front of you. 

You take it off FB Marketplace and put it on Turo for others to love your pride and joy of a vehicle. It goes off wonderfully and others enjoy it that people are renting it out every weekend and the CuckTruck is your commuting car. Then 2 months later the unthinkable has happened, your pride and joy CuckTruck was in an accident due to the guy on Turo had a few too many drinks and crashed it into a ditch, the indestructible truck got damaged and you demand it to be repaired through insurance but the driver insisted that he will pay for it in cash on a bi-weekly basis. You‚Äôre thrilled and excited you shake his hand. He gives you his contact information and email address and he sets off for you to set up the contract. Later that night, you send it and it comes back as an invalid email. You call the number he gave you and it‚Äôs the local Hooters restaurant. You tell your wife about it and she becomes apathetic towards you. 

Determined to pay off the damages you post again on to FB Marketplace this time to pull trailers and haul loads for people doing DIY projects because you have a truck and it can do truck stuff. But you quickly realize that it cannot tow anything nor put heavy objects in the vault due to severe battery loss and the tailgate is now warped. You don‚Äôt want to wait 1.5 hours everyday and pay $75 to use a supercharger. You even come home to your wife and she loaded her recent shopping at Costco in her Honda Fit and it used up the same space as the bed of the CuckTruck. When you asked her, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you call me?‚Äù She just rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúThat thing is useless.‚Äù And told you you‚Äôre sleeping on the couch from now on. 

Defeated, you put it up on FB Marketplace $15k below what you paid for it. Still no buyers, you blame all the CuckTruck YouTubers, Twitter and r/CyberStuck for all your problems except Elon Musk. 

Then one day, you find that your tires are worn out just after 6000 miles of usage and need to be replaced. But you‚Äôre broke, you up to your wife‚Äôs room just to find her ‚Äúspread eagle‚Äù by your next door neighbour who owns a real truck. They don‚Äôt stop with you staring at them and just keep going like you‚Äôre not there. You quietly close the door behind you and sob in the love of your life, your CuckTruck. You speed off to get away from it all. Speeding up to a T-intersection and as you approach it, you realize the gas pedal is stuck to the floor. Before you can get control of the CuckTruck by stomping on the brake and gas pedals you collide on to an embankment at 88 MPH. 

You wake up and realize it was all just a dream and you just fell asleep after cancelling your preorder in your brand new Vinfast.

"""Not driven by human"" markings?This is not strictly Tesla specific, but this community appears like the right place to bring it up. With Waymo and other sensor-based self driving systems, it's been quite obvious that the car is not driven by a human by just looking at it. But with Tesla insisting on going with cameras only, and sensors likely becoming smaller over time, should these cars not be marked with something to indicate the car may not be operated by a human driver? Similar to how some countries mandate special signs on vehicles driven by learners, as well as novice or very senior drivers?

"Looks like more owners are experiencing battery and PCS failuresEarliest Model 3s are barely seven years old.  People want to believe that there are fewer parts and repairs on their Teslas but that's likely only true when comparing them to really unreliable vehicles.

Haven't really spent much on my 14 y.o. ICEV bought new and 13 y.o. HEV (bought off a friend) besides refueling and oil and fluid changes.  On my HEV, $900-1,200 a year on gasoline expenditures.

With depreciation and repair costs, I wonder if I am really missing out any anything by having withdrawn my security deposit a year after the Model 3 unveil.

"Never again a Tesla for a reason I did not expect (even though I like my Model Y)I actually like my Tesla Model Y. I find it a great car and I enjoy driving it. Even with Musk being the idiot that he is I would buy another Tesla. But that all came to crashing halt when I saw the repair costs.  
  
If you look at the body damage there is a slight scratch on the paint in the middle. The body is slightly dented. I took this to my regular body shop who does our Mercedes cars and he said give or take about a 1,000 Euros. But he could not do the work because he is not an official Tesla place and hence cannot do the work, or will not do the work. He also indicated only get it done in a Tesla shop because of the warranty.

So I asked for two quotes and the answer was 2,380 Euros and 2,550 CHF. Are you fracken kidding me? We always fix our own little dents because our deductible is about 750 Euros. In most cases we are always below 1,500 Euros. My wifes Mercedes GLA who had a torn fender that needed replacing cost 1,350ish CHF. And that was done by Mercedes Switzerland, not exactly a cheap haven.

I said to my wife, nope never again a Tesla. She agreed because those are outrageous prices and if we have to go via the insurance our already expensive insurance will continue to go through the roof. As she said I will drive around with a dented car until the battery completely dies.

"Hey #NHTSA, can you please stop Tesla from allowing people to watch videos while drivingSo numerous people keep posting videos of themselves watching video while driving. Something that Tesla was supposed to have stopped, and the NHTSA is supposed to have told them to stop. 

Famously Tesla still allows an open browser in North America, which is stupid enough by itself, NO web browsing!  And there are workarounds from third parties to allow video while driving.

Tesla should be duty-bound to realize and prevent this, it's widely known; not a secret hack. Also the NHTSA should mandate they turn off the web browser altogether.  It's disallowed in Australia because of distracted driving.

"The current EV Market sucks if you want a sports sedan that is affordableRight now outside of Tesla, your only options if you want a sports sedan are in the ultra luxury category. The closest cars to the model 3 are the polestar 2 and ioniq 6, and unfortunately they both have similar issues to the Tesla. The ioniq 6 has touch buttons which are pretty annoying. And the polestar 2 is really cramped inside. Then there's the issue of the polestar 2 is really heavy and can't get 300 miles of range. It's so annoying that all the legacy auto makers are copying Tesla for interior design. Oddly enough there's plenty of gas cars out there that still have tons of buttons. Right now I'm planning on sticking to gas cars till we get EV sedans that are fast and have lots of buttons. But I overall feel hopeless that will ever happen. The sedan/coupe market in the USA is almost dead. Maybe 10 years from now some of the ultra luxury EV sedans will be affordable, but then there's the issue of long term maintenance costs/battery degradation",11-04-2024

"So how many of you are getting / have gotten rid of your Teslas based on the behavior of the person at the helm of that company? Be honest. Of course, the title applies to several owners here on this sub but chime in even if you aren‚Äôt an owner because you decided to not become an owner for wherever reasons. 

My personal standpoint is that I buy a car to buy a car. I‚Äôm not associating myself with any personalities just by buying a car with their name associated with it on paper, and I‚Äôll still criticize its maker and CEO for their words and actions. Additionally, not everything media portrays is contextual. We all know that by now. It‚Äôs a profit driven business. 

And let‚Äôs be honest, Tesla as a concept is not Elon‚Äôs brains. If anything, some of his corner cutting decisions have made the car worse. Being in Technology myself, I am rewarding the real engineers. 

I also criticize the car daily for some key missing features and overall flimsy feel. But I still think it‚Äôs a pretty good car and better than many in its class. Now, if I had the money to throw away, I‚Äôd probably want something different next time around like an R1S just as a breath of fresh air as Tesla are getting stale and gaining Uber cab reputation. But I do appreciate how far along Tesla‚Äôs UI, Infotainment, and infrastructure elements are compared to other EV offerings, let alone traditional ICE cars. So yes, it is hard to leave the Tesla ecosystem for another EV (Rivian slowly becoming a viable albeit expensive alternative)

I just feel like we have a lot of owners here of the brand who think the same. And some who don‚Äôt. But this sub is meant to be critical of everything Tesla and everything Elon, so I‚Äôm also trying to gauge just how far current owners are willing to go to boycott or, well, just talk smack while they drive their Teslas, which is fine. 

I am just curious to know your viewpoints without placing any judgments. So, please stay kind and refrain from personal attacks. ",10-30-2024

I see so much conflicting information. Sometimes it says that it‚Äôs an EPA estimate and nothing to do with battery health.

"For me, the biggest sell of the Tesla is the charging network. How close are we to getting reliable charging for other cars?Recently rented a Kia Niro EV when I was in California, and charging it was a huge pain in the ass, even in an area with ostensibly a lot of charging infrastructure. When I've borrowed a relative's Tesla, the charging infrastructure made it really easy. What's the progress on getting other cars on that network? Or expanding non-Tesla networks? I see all these charging achievements being touted, but my personal experience has been disappointing. I have a 2014 Chevy Volt and trying to charge it ANYWHERE is a coin flip. I'm even someone who will really plan ahead and I'm willing to walk way out of my way to charge it, and I'd say I'm able to charge as planned less than 20% of the time.

I rarely need a car so I'll drive my Volt into the ground before I buy a new one, but it's hard for me to recommend non-Tesla EVs to other people, particularly in cities like mine where you can't really charge at home, without a fast charging network like Tesla's. 

What has everyone else's experience been with your non-Tesla EVs? Have you been able to use Tesla's charging network? Do you have adequate charging options, particularly if you can't charge at home?

"Elon Musk Confirms There‚Äôs No $25,000 Tesla EV On The Way",10-24-2024
"Elon's final play before he leaves Tesla?TLDR: Yes, I lost money on Tesla puts. Yes, the margin improvement/cost reduction is impressive. But the golden carrot he put in front of investors faces regarding a bright Tesla future is just bullshit and only serves for Musks well payed exit, if Trump wins. Then he can easily argue, that he has to leave Tesla because duty calls in the government and he never actually has to deliver. So OTM call (280) till/after Trumps win and after that put options once he announces, that he works for Trump now.

First things first, margin improvement, free cash flow and improved cost of production is very impressive and shows that the core business is doing well.

Nevertheless, this does not correlate anyhow with the stock price. So lets talk the golden future laied out in the earnings call.

* There is no way the HW3 will be able to be used as a robotaxi, he finally said that.
* They are already testing ride hailing/robotaxis with drivers --> whats the news here?! Its like any other Tesla with FSD where a driver is sitting behind the wheele.
* How the f\* does he project 20-30% growth in 2025:
   * All factories are close to max. capacity. Mexico factory is on hold, Shanghai might start soon. BUT: The economy in china is f\*. Tensions with Taiwan are rising and could escalate.
   * US sales are down.
   * The economy and EV business in Europe is struggling.
   * The 25k vehicle is canceled --> no growth here.
   * The Cybertruck is a niche product for the US.
   * There are no details regarding the affordable models. If actually starting in Q1 2025 those can only be stripped down existing models. I really doubt that people will go for those cars.
* No news on licences for robotaxis:
   * It is extremely risky to bet on the no stearingwheel/only camera approach. Everybody else uses multiple sensors and still faces situation they cant handle, especially not legally if shit hits the fan.
   * The legal issue regarding robotaxis is not solved and not in Teslas hands to solve.
   * Volume production for Robotaxis in 2026 might sound nice but as stated before, you don't know if Tesla is actually allowed to deploy them.

All those points combined with fact, that he even managed to give multiple contradicting statements during the earnings call leave me with following conclusion:

Due to the financial mess he is in with his Twitter purchase and all those unachievable promises he prepares his golden exit. He wants to push the stock as high as possible before the Trump election and will then leave since the government will call and he is destined to serve America. This way he can solve his financial mess with Twitter while saving his face. So long till the election and short after that.",10-24-2024

Im looking at getting my first EV.   
My budget is around what a new model 3 costs. Ive been test driving model 3, huyndai Kona, VW id.4, and a Renault megane e-tech.

  
I have not tried KIA as im not attracted to how they look, at all.

The renault megane e-tech is my favourite, but the range and space compared to a model 3 is just 2 different worlds.

Ive never been a fan of tesla, but nothing comes close to a teslas range and efficiency for money. Looking at specs nothing else than a model 3 makes sense tbh... are teslas as bad as some people make them? are they as unreliable as people around here make it sound?

If this thing had good enough AI then it could basically be a Terminator (but a lot slower, weaker, and less tanky).  Instead it has no AI at all and is just remote control.  That means you could stick a standard military rifle into the human-like hands and send the things off to clear out a city without risking the lives of soldiers, who would all be sitting back at base.  When a robot gets 'killed' that soldier just starts controlling another one...and no worries that they will rise up and wipe out humanity.  Sure, they would be less effective than real troops but you could basically deploy as many as the total number of troops you have worldwide to any given location and just overwhelm anyone with numbers, then deploy all those same troops halfway around the world with almost no notice.  You could even bump up your numbers by gamifying it and getting civilians to control them.  Obviously Boston Dynamics or Honda could do this a whole lot better, but they haven't been giving truckloads of money to Trump so they wouldn't get the contract.

"Long Term Reliability I've been driving a 2008 Honda Civic for probably the last 7 years, car had 95k miles when I bought it and now has 245k miles with almost zero maintenance other than routine stuff. I've recently gotten more established in my career and am in a position to upgrade since the Civic is starting to really show its age now. 

  I've considered Accord hybrids and a few others but recently started looking at Teslas because I really like the looks of the 2024 refresh (model 3). Me and the wife went and test drove one at Tesla of Knoxville Saturday and I was blown away. The interior and acceleration are insane in my eyes coming from a 2008 Civic the Tesla seems like a spaceship. 

  My only major concern is long term reliability, I'm wanting to buy new so I'll be covered by the warranty for as long as possible. It's a bit alarming though how many post I see about stuff as simple as door gasket material messing up on cars that aren't even 3 years old yet and all these model 3s that are having issues with less than 100k miles. 

  Pretty much my question is I wanna hear from the people that have had little to no issues, if you have 100k+ mile and have had no problems I'd like the hear about your experience. Also one more thing what's up with all the 2021s that are having battery issues, are the battery's in the 2021s different from other years or is the same kind of battery used in the 2024s. Crazy how many HV packs have been failing on the 2021s with low low miles.

It seems to confirm the idea that all of Elon's activities are in search of and support of SpaceX, but also that the approach behind Robotaxi and SpaceX has virtues and is potentially very smart. Though it attempts to cover the positive points of Tesla's choices fairly, I think it inadvertently makes a strong case for booting Elon. 

On the other hand, the article finally explains to me at least, why his board may be enamored enough of him to keep him on.

The money paragraph: ""The Tesla bet, though, is that Waymo‚Äôs approach ultimately doesn‚Äôt scale and isn‚Äôt generalizable to true Level 5, while starting with the dream ‚Äî true autonomy ‚Äî leads Tesla down a better path of relying on nothing but AI, fueled by data and fine-tuning that you can only do if you already have millions of cars on the road. That is the connection to SpaceX and what happened this weekend: if you start with the dream, then understand the cost structure necessary to achieve that dream, you force yourself down the only path possible, forgoing easier solutions that don‚Äôt scale for fantastical ones that do.""",10-15-2024

Four people dead after a Tesla erupted into flames in France,10-13-2024
"My Model Y is stressful to drive.Did a 90 mi round trip drive yesterday, I had four phantom breaking events, one with a guy right behind me. On top of that I had two warnings to take control immediately, complete with blaring alarms, and both times with my hands literally on the steering wheel. 
This was in just TACC because I find FSD just a white hot mess.  Everytime I think I can relax a little, an alarm goes off or the brakes slam on.  Not what I was promised, and not something you experience in a demo drive either.  It's only when living with it day to day the negatives really shine through.

I'm asking Tesla about a return, but barring that I'll likely sell at a loss soon and go back to an old-fashioned car with regular cruise control and limited safety systems.  I'm about 3 weeks into ownership and so far 100% of the stressors have been safety system related.  The EV portion of the Model Y is simply amazing, great efficiency and incredible power delivery. It's the safety inclusions that make it stressful to drive, the irony.

I had a Chevy Bolt for 4 years so EV driving is not new to me, but the Bolt had none of these safety or driver assist annoyances, it allowed me to simply drive it.
I just get the impression that the Model Y doesn't seem to want me to drive it, like it just wants to stay plugged into a charger and never move.

"The Robotaxi and how Musk is beaten by mathSo the robotaxi costs $30,000 and according to Musk, it will cost riders as low as $0.2 per mile. It consumes 18 kWh per 100 miles and has a range of 200 miles.

So essentially if you use it as a robotaxi you can do 150,000 miles before you exceed the initial cost of buying one. At an average annual mileage of 13,500 miles that means you can use robotaxis for 11 years until you spent $30,000. 

Now let's factor in electricity. By design, a robotaxi will rarely charge at home. Most will be charged on Superchargers. If we assume an average cost of $0.40 (can be much higher during peak times) per kWh those 150,000 miles would have cost us around $10,800. That gets us another 54,000 miles when we simply order one on demand. l

If we factor in insurance at $2,000 per year, that's $22,000 over eleven years, which gives us another 110,000 miles if we order it on demand.

So the actual cost if you own one and use it is $62,800 for 11 years. Versus $30,000 to just order it on demand for 11 years. And you don't have any benefits. You  still have to clean it if you own it. You still can't leave your personal belongings inside if you own it and intend to share it as a robotaxi.

So let's say you own it. One thing to keep in mind is that the smaller the battery in an EV, the more charging cycles you have, meaning it simply dies faster over the same distance. The robotaxi will also be almost exclusively fast charged to minimise downtime. That also means higher degredation.

Going by a large taxi operator, the average mileage of a taxi that is running double shifts (or 24/7) is 70,000 miles per year. 40 % of that time is spent without passengers. That means 42,000 miles per year can be done with passengers. At $0.20 per mile that's potential revenue of $8.400 per year. At the same time those 70,000 miles would cost the owner $5,000 in electricity alone when charged publicly. Insurance is another $2,000. Now you are already at $7,000 cost to earn $8,400 a year. You spent $30k to make $1,400 a year - before cleaning cost, before Tesla's share to get riders to your robotaxi. Before new tires once or twice a year. Before paying any rates for that car. Before taxes. It's quite obvious that at $0.20 per mile the service would be wildly unprofitable. The actual minimum cost would be $1+ to somehow turn this into a profitable operation. And then they aren't competitive with busses anymore, which Musk himself said would cost $1 per mile.

It's a bad idea all around. It's also impossible to use that robotaxi for handicapped people, for groups of more than two, for transporting some Ikea furniture back home and loads of other common taxi use cases. So it can't even reach the same 100 % of the potential customers.

You also can't pay an autonomous taxi $10 more to entice it to reach the destination a bit faster.

Why butterfly doors? Good luck getting out in a tight spot or an area with low clearance.

Why are the seats so low to the ground and why is the roof so low? Anyone who has gotten into and out of sedans and SUVs/vans knows exactly how much easier the latter is on the back and joints.

This feels to me like a clever joke, El\*n M\*sk was like, ok how do we make this as bad as possible, just to mess with everybody and he's laughing the whole ride home.

The Model Y would make a better robotaxi because it has more seating, seats at a nice height, roof at a nice height, and higher profile tires for a softer ride.

"Launch Event Theatre: An Elon Musk ProductionWe really have Steve Jobs and Apple to thank for this mess. While companies have long tried to announce new products with big events, Apple had a nice run where these events really became EVENTS in the minds of the general public. 

The difference of course is that Apple announced the product when it was built and ready to go, and would be in stores on a set date (not a perpetual ‚Äú18 months‚Äù into the future). 

Elon has realized that there‚Äôs a segment of the population that is now addicted to the show and doesn‚Äôt seem to mind that the product never arrives or when it does, it never lives up to the promises made at the launch event. Tesla Semi exists, but it was supposed to be replacing trains and truck drivers by driving in automated convoys by now. 

It‚Äôs crazy that tomorrow he‚Äôs going to announce a product that isn‚Äôt finished (but definitely will be in ‚Äú18 months‚Äù) and people are going to get a big chubby one for it and buy Tesla stock on Friday. 

FSD still needs major improvements to drive without a driver, and many experts believe it will never happen with cameras alone. If a city allows it to be deployed before it‚Äôs at Waymo levels of safety, people are going to die and it will be a disaster for Tesla stock. I don‚Äôt understand how investors can‚Äôt see this reality. 

And even if it eventually works and gets approved for use, why are we pretending like the taxi business is the same something like software?  When you make something like Microsoft office and dominate the market, you can make billions of copies of it for nothing more than your additional tech support costs. 

Taxis still exist in the physical world and therefore have physical limitations.  I‚Äôve seen articles taking about how a robotaxi can go 24 hours a day unlike a human. Oh really? And the battery charges on what, magic?  

Cars wear out per mile, and that taxi fleet will need maintenance and upkeep. Tires, brakes, batteries, worn out interiors, cleaning, charging stations. A car moving continuously 18 hours per day at 30 mph travels almost 200,000 miles in a year. If it costs $80,000 for the car alone (Waymos are $180,000) it‚Äôs race against time for the car to pay for itself before it has to be replaced. 

Most people use taxis for two reasons: to and from the airport and when drinking to avoid killing someone. The rest of the time they want their own car if they can afford it. Is it possible that kids today will accept not owning a car when they are adults? Yes, but now we‚Äôre talking decades before individual car ownership becomes rare. And if we do get there, I‚Äôm betting that Tesla is not the dominant player in that market. ",10-09-2024

Tesla has lost one of its top executives in Europe in charge of all business development and public policies.

He is one of two top Tesla executives to leave this week.

Jos Dings joined Tesla in 2017 after more than a decade at Transport & Environment (T&E), a European group promoting sustainable transport.

After a few years managing Tesla‚Äôs government affairs in Europe, Dings was promoted to Director of Public Policy and Business Development for EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa).",10-04-2024

"Elon Musk is staking Tesla's very future on his Oct. 10 robotaxi unveilIs this another ""people will be able sleep while traveling cross country"" moment where suckers buy in and don't see shit for a decade? ",09-29-2024
"Review: 6 Weeks in a Tesla - WTF?!I'll preface this by saying I've never been the type to seek out reddit pages to rant, but my recent experience has turned me into one of those people. I was never an ""Anti-Tesa"" person. My opinional disagreements stem from my personal belief that hybrids are the realistic future unless this country embraces nuclear energy. I would enjoy trolling the type of Tesla owner that acts obnoxious that they are single handedly saving mankind with their Tesla but don't have an answer when you ask them where electricity comes from. 

I had been in a couple different Teslas previously but I just finished a 6 week extended rental of a 23 Model 3 while my car was in the body shop. I don't think I can encounter anything in my life that was so incredibly hyped and turned out so incredibly horrible. 

Now, I'll admit, I was in a rental (likely) base level Model 3 long range, so I'm willing to admit that my experience might have been slightly more positive in a higher end model. That being said, I am now convinced more than ever that the Tesla enthusiasts that obnoxious talk up these cars so much are nothing but rabid fan boys that are completely blind to what a piece of crap this car is. 

Despite being their ""lower"" model car, the MSRP on model I had (when new) started around 40k+. I've seen used models of the exact  i had with the same mileage (16k) for about 30k+. What I experience for a car of that price blew my mind! 

First, when I picked up the car, the drivers door made a loud pop noise when opening in. Fearing the car they gave me must have been in an accident, I asked for a different car. They showed me 2 others that made a similar sound. The rental manager informed me that most of the Tesla they've had make that noise and it was just a ""Tesla thing"". 
Onto the famous Tesla build quality. The cheap plastic panels that creek with the slightest touch. The horrible faux pleather seats and wheel. I personally hate the ipad knock off UI that you have to use for EVERYTHING, but I'll admit that is a personal preference and give that a pass. The sounds this car made with every slightest bump in the road made me feel like I was driving a 2000 Mitsu Mirage. 

While the car has some very unique and (formally) ahead of its time features that I found to be completely novelty and largely useless. (Disco lights and romance mode? Seriously?). After my extended test drive I firmly believe that the fan boys point to these unique gimmicks to cover the fact that a 40k car doesn't have many super basic features you'll find on base model Hyundai's, Hondas, or any other brand.  

First, refusing to integrate Car Play and Android auto in laughable. Its like driving a car from early 2000 when bluetooth audio was a technological gift from God lol. The built in navigation (like the rest of the car) is atrocious. No ventilated seats. Oh a glass roof, that's kind of cool, but it doesnt open lmao. The road noise was something I haven't experience on any car in the last decade. The loud whistling coming from the windows has me constantly checking that the windows were rolled up. They were, of course. I suppose windows that don't seal is part of their fresh air feature. 

I see ""Full self driving"" and think okay, this should be cool. Here is that awesome technological I've heard about. I almost pissed myself laughing when I realized it's nothing more than adaptive cruise control, which I had standard on my 2016 Civic and is not only standard, but far superior only my current 22 Honda and my wife's 22 Hyundai (not to mention insanely significantly better build quality, interior and interior materials).  Outside of engaging ""full self driving"" which seemed to mandate cruise control, the car doesn't even have active lane keep assist!ü§Ø Which is not only standard on my Honda and Wife's Hyndai, it works SIGNIFICANTLY better than teslas full self driving. I start to veer out of my lane and my Honda/Hyundai automatically pulls me back into place. Not to mention the active lane keep assist works at any speed and isnt something that requires cruise control at high way speeda. When adaptive cruise control is on, the car continues to steer itself, accurately, through some very strong curves and bends in the road. This Teslas FSD would disengage at the slightest bend in the road. 

I could go on and on but I've wasted enough of my time on this, frankly, really shitty car lol. 40k+ for that car is absolutely laughable. 

If electric cars are your thing, that's great. But in 2024, every single major car company has Electric cars/SUVs that are infinitely better than these overhyped cheap pieces of junk Elon is making. 

I'm trying to be objective in my review because I really didn't have any prior prejudice against Tesla prior to this 6 week rental. Maybe other than I tend to find a disproportionate amount of Tesla owners I've met to have this douchey arrogance but, to be fair, you can find that anywhere. 
So, what am I missing? Why does this company have such a large cult-like following of enthusiasts? Because what I just drove for 1.5 months was a complete POS and the entire time I wish I had taken the new Elantra or Altima they had but I wanted to see what the hype was about.

"Safety Score and premium score don‚Äôt match, Tesla Insurance hung up on me. I've had tesla insurance since April of this year, and just renewed for an additional six months since its been a good experience, until today. Historically, my premium has been aligned with my safety score (I live in Texas, so whatever Cali has going on doesn't apply to me). Up until this last week, my premium has updated in accordance to my safety score live. However the night before my October bill was finalized, I noticed that although my score was 91, my premium was only for a score of 90. Not a huge deal as a few extra bucks won't kill me, but I took screenshots and sent it over to the Tesla Insurance Support email. Currently my score is now 93, but my premium for November is still showing 90. I have gotten no response, not even an acknowledgment of my email. So this morning, when I had a meeting cancel, I said ""screw it"" and called the number for Tesla Insurance, willing to wait the long hold time. When I got ahold of an agent, and explained the situation, she completely disregarded my concern, and kept saying ""the premium is just an estimate"". I confirmed that I was aware of that, and patiently explained my concern was that the safety score seems completely independent of my premium, and historically that has not been the case. Her response then became ""thank you for that feedback."" Again, I patiently articulated that it wasn't feedback, it was an issue having a financial impact on their customer, and that this didn't align with my previous months. At this point she kept saying there was nothing she could do and I should just wait for an email response (which is obviously just going to say the same thing). At this point I asked if I could speak to a supervisor, she put me on a brief hold (at which point I felt like it might be of value of record the conversation for my own records), and what you hear is her saying a higher up will reach out eventually, and hanging up on me. So yeah, at this point all that good experience is gone and don't really have confidence in their ability to provide the basic function of their variable insurance offering. So if you see a red M3 going dukes a hazard in Texas, its me bc regardless of my score I'm paying for a 90 I guess.",09-26-2024

"Buys a car and complains about negative equityI just read a post where the OP was complaining about negative equity, and from the discussions, it seems like Tesla buyers often view their cars as *something special that holds a higher value than others*.

"Tesla / Elon are keeping a No-Mars list?A close friend who works at Tesla recently got laid off. Without sharing any personal identifying details, he was working on one of the more high profile projects at Tesla which Elon often tweets about.

"NYT article highlights a $22,445.72 hotel payment paid by Musk's security staff.I was reading the recent article on Musk's security apparatus via the NYT and came across something very strange.

It was a segment where they said his security guys sometimes did errands for him, including paying a $22,445.72 hotel bill on his behalf for family and staff in 2016. 

This I find very weird, because firstly its a very high hotel bill. But also why is he entrusting his security staff with such a big payment?

But also, the bill was for **Musk's family and staff's accommodation at a luxury hotel.**

Now either, Musk is personally paying out for his staff's accommodation luxury accommodation which I find unlikely.   
  
Or Tesla shareholders are paying for Musk, his staff and his family to live it up in Hong Kong in a luxury hotel.
