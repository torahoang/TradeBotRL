The company laid off more than 10% of its workforce on Monday, and lost two of its highest-ranking executives. A few days later, Tesla asked shareholders to re-vote on CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation package that was struck down by a judge earlier this year.Reports of problems with the Cybertruck’s accelerator pedal started popping up in the last few weeks. Tesla even reportedly paused deliveries of the truck while it sorted out the issue. Musk said in a post on X that Tesla was “being very cautious” and the company reported to NHTSA that it was not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the problem.The company has now confirmed to NHTSA that the pedal can dislodge, making it possible for it to slide up and get caught in the trim around the footwell.

The vehicle will not unlock if you are wearing pants. With a resolution of 1.2 megapixels, you should be able to see all the good stuff. ” At press time, the feature was reportedly discontinued after the company discovered not a single Tesla owner was a woman.</blockquote>

The myth of green growth is just a dirty ideological magic trick to close ranks against domestic criticism. It suggests a way out of the climate catastrophe. But “green capitalism” stands for colonialism, land theft, and an exacerbation of the climate crisis! Lithium batteries come from toxic mines in Chile and use up other rare metals, which means misery and destruction for those who live where the mines are. The battery factory in Grünheide near Berlin, for example, requires the rare raw material lithium, which is also mined in Bolivia. Musk puts his cards on the table when it comes to pushing through lithium mining in Bolivia: “We will coup whoever we want,” he says, commenting on Indigenous resistance to mining. Mineral resources are being ripped from the earth under brutal conditions. The “green deal” is merely the expansion of economic growth without limits. In Portugal, too, the rural population is resisting the forced extraction of lithium.""     ",negative

10-11-2024,"I just finished watching  where they unveiled a bunch of things like the Robovan, Robotaxi, and bunch of other things. They all looked fun and nice. Elon, as usual, sold hard. Why wouldn’t he, he’s the CEO of the company.One thing that really caught my eye and freaked me out was the Tesla Optimus.Look at that thing yourself. That is scary. Before I get to why I think it’s scary, let me explain something.Tesla’s OptimusOver the past few years, Elon has complained incessantly about regulating AI. Now, I know why he did and continues to do that – ’cause he or his companies aren’t leading the efforts and he’s just salty that one of his investments (*cough* OpenAI *cough*) took off <em>after</em> he threatened it and left it. Anyone with more than two working brain cells would know why he wants to regulate AI. He just can’t stomach the fact that OpenAI took off and is leading now in terms of AI research. He just can’t get over it and even filed a lawsuit. He later dropped it. I mean, why wouldn’t he? He didn’t have a valid case. Classic, Elon. Funny thing is he co-founded OpenAI because he couldn’t stomach the fact that Google was leading the efforts in AI research. He wanted to stick it to Google and ended up royally sticking it to himself.He did the same with Twitter – filed a lawsuit and later dropped that one too. He was then forced to buy it. He then decided to spin it off as if he bought the platform for protecting free speech. This is just to show how he tries to spin his failures and make them look like successful endeavors.After bitching about regulating AI all these years, he even started a new company called xAI and shoved their efforts down Twitter users’ throats. This man thinks AI is so dangerous and yet decides to put it in all his cars, the new Robotaxis, Robovans, and bots.Now that I’ve painted a picture of what kind of a person Elon is, here’s why I think these Optimus bots are dangerous.What if the bot trips and falls on your infant child?<br>What if it accidentally knocks someone out?<br>What if the bot gets hacked and goes rogue? <br>These seem ridiculous to hear at first, but they are real possibilities.Now my question is – <em>Why isn’t Elon talking about regulating the bots?</em>The only right answer is because he’s the one developing them. When he does it, it’s fine. When others do it, he goes on to sulk, bitch and moan endlessly, and files a senseless lawsuit…and drops it.These bots should 100% be regulated. There should be a spec to comply to for manufacturing these bots. Some of the regulations that I can think of for safety –<ol><li>They shouldn’t be able to overpower a young adult. They should be weak.</li><li>They should be short.</li><li>They should have very limited battery power and should require human intervention to charge them.</li><li>They should have limited memory.</li></ol>I think there’s a real need to regulate these bots early on. Elon can absolutely not be trusted. He’s a quite smart and cunning person.      ",positive

Tesla’s warning shocked some folks. Here’s what it said:    “To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for complete wash. If necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.”<br>    Tesla Cybertruck owner’s manualThat’s right, stainless steel exposed to certain substances can corrode–and the Cybertruck is no different. So if you go for a drive in the summer and bugs splatter across the solid stainless “grille” of your Cybertruck, you’ll want to scrape them off immediately.

08-09-2024,"Elon Musk  is attacking the core foundations of American democracy on multiple fronts. ♦️There’s his thus-far successful effort to get rid of the National Labor Relations Board (  ). ♦️There’s his political action committee, , which pretends to help register people to vote but is just hoovering up voter data to give to the Trump campaign. ♦️And there’s his lawsuit seeking to force companies to advertise on X, despite the fact advertisers generally do not want their ads running next to the Nazi content X is full of now. 🔥All of these efforts have the potential to succeed because the federal courts are broken, and the administrative state is dying a slow and painful death.&nbsp;⚠️Immiserating workers⚠️Let’s start with the . <br>It’s no surprise that Musk is no friend to labor. <br>He doesn’t believe in unions, saying that they create “a lords and peasants sort of thing,” whatever that means. When workers at his Fremont, California,  plant began an organizing campaign, 💥he tweeted that they would lose their stock options if they joined the union. 💥This sort of threat is extremely illegal, and the NLRB sided with the workers who brought multiple unfair labor practices charges against Tesla. Tesla also 💥prohibited workers from wearing t-shirts with union insignias, 💥even though the right to wear pro-union clothing at work has been a legally protected activity for several decades. Then, of course, there’s the class-action lawsuit in California state court, where almost 6,000 Black workers at the Fremont factory recently got the right to sue Tesla for ignoring   at that plant. How massive? Nooses at the workstations of Black workers massive.&nbsp;Of course, ❓why follow the law when the lower federal courts are now stuffed with anti-worker Federalist Society denizens <br>and the Supreme Court just gutted the regulatory state? ❓After the NLRB filed a formal complaint against  over its firing of several employees who wrote an internal letter critical of Musk, <br>💥SpaceX made sure to find a friendly Trump-appointed judge in Texas, 💥 , <br>to entertain its theory that the NLRB itself is unconstitutional.&nbsp;In late July, 🔥Albright issued an injunction blocking the NLRB from proceeding against SpaceX, 🔥<br>saying that it is likely the company would prevail in showing that the NLRB, <br>which was created by Congress nearly 90 years ago, impermissibly infringes on the president’s power. Members of the NLRB board and the Administrative Law Judges (ALJ) cannot be removed by the president. That insulation from removal, of course, is critical, as otherwise the NLRB would basically cease to exist every time a Republican president takes power.Narrowly, Albright’s holding means that the NLRB can’t go after Musk until the constitutional issue is resolved. Broadly, Albright’s holding tees up the possibility that the anti-worker judges of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the conservative majority on the Supreme Court will have an opportunity to just get rid of labor protections entirely. Given the composition of the courts, Musk doesn’t need Trump to win this November to succeed at wiping a nearly century-old agency off the map. But Musk, of course, is all in on Trump, despite places like the New York Times pretending the man’s politics are a mystery. Musk has also learned that he’s basically untouchable, <br>which is likely why his America PAC is flagrantly deceiving voters. There will probably be no consequences for Musk at all<br>",negative

03-13-2024,"How Do You Put a Tesla Model X in Gear?OVER THE WEEKEND, the Wall Street Journal published a long report on the accidental death of the shipping magnate  , sister to former transportation secretary Elaine Chao and sister-in-law to soon-to-be former Senate Republican leader  . News of Angela Chao's death first appeared in shipping trade publications with no explanation, then was vaguely reported as an automobile accident; <br>McConnell, in announcing his plans to resign from his leadership post, said her dying had prompted him to think about the end of his own career.&nbsp;What the Journal reported was that Chao had  inside her  Model X after accidentally backing it into a pond on her Texas estate, on the short drive between the guesthouse and the main house. According to the story, she called a friend in the guesthouse from inside the sinking car to ask for help:&nbsp;<br>While making a three-point turn, she had put the car in reverse instead of drive, she said. It is a mistake she had made before with the Tesla gearshift. <br>The car had zipped backward, tipping over an embankment and into a pond.&nbsp;By now, whenever anyone dies in a Tesla, the natural question to ask is whether or not the Tesla killed them, or helped kill them. How do you put a car into reverse instead of drive? <br>The online manual for the Model X, has a diagram showing how you put the car in gearIt shows an interface on the Tesla's touchscreen. It has no label for either ""Drive"" or ""Reverse""; the blue arrows, judging by the diagrams in the rest of the manual, are not part of the display, but the manual's indication of how the driver is supposed to move their finger. <br>The text explains: When you press the brake pedal when parked, the drive mode strip displays on one side of the touchscreen. Use the drive mode strip to shift Model X: swipe up for Drive, swipe down for Reverse or touch the P for Park or N for Neutral. The drive mode strip is always available on the touchscreen when you touch Controls.Even by Tesla's ridiculous design standards, this is a shockingly bad control system. There is no stable convention around whether swiping up means ""go up"" or ""go down""; <br>notoriously, Microsoft and Apple have completely opposite theories about which way makes sense. And that dispute is only about manipulating text on your computer screen, not setting a two-and-a-half-ton vehicle into physical motion. Tesla's choice of direction<br>—flicking the little car-glyph upward, as if you're pushing the car itself, rather than flicking it down, as if you're pulling the landscape so the car moves forward<br>—is not only the opposite of the way you advance along the road on a touchscreen in Google Maps, it's the opposite of how you drop a normal automatic-transmission car into Drive with a physical shifter. The wrist and shoulder rotate down and back, and the car goes forward. Presumably this had something to do with why Angela Chao had previously had trouble shifting the Tesla into the correct gear.  's design team, committed to his adolescent theories of futurism<br>—and to moving as many controls as possible from physical buttons, knobs, or levers to the much cheaper touchscreen, even in a car that starts at $79,900<br>—built a system that runs contrary to a driver's muscle memory of how to put a car in gear. It's also theoretically possible that the Tesla put itself in gear. The Model X includes a beta feature, which a driver would need to specifically activate, in which the car scans its surroundings and makes a guess on its own as to whether it should shift into Drive or Reverse: When Auto Shift out of Park is enabled, Model X is designed to automatically select Drive or Reverse. The instrument panel displays the selected drive mode when the driver's door is closed and seat belt is buckled.To override the selection, press the brake pedal and use the drive mode strip on touchscreen to shift into your desired drive mode (Drive, Reverse, Park; see Shift Using the Touchscreen).Confirm the drive mode selection and follow the instructions on the instrument panel before you press the accelerator.With your car rolling backwards out of control, simply turn your attention to the touchscreen<br>—because there is no physical button to feel for <br>—stab your finger at the letter P, hit it precisely, and hold it there. What could be easier? ",negative
