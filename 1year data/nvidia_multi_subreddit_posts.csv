"AI Stocks: Tech Giants, Cloud Titans Face 'Show Me' Moment. Nvidia Mojo Gone? ",12-30-2024
"NVIDIA's GPU monster is about to come out of the cage, and today's prices will be its starting point.The Nvidia Blackwell B300 series processors excel in a number of ways that make them an important breakthrough in AI, big data, and hyperscale computing:



1. Dramatic Performance Improvements

The B300 series delivers a 50% increase in compute performance over the B200 series. This performance increase is not only achieved through more compute cores and higher clock frequencies, but also through a more optimized 4NP process (Nvidia's custom 4nm process). For applications that need to process complex AI models, the B300 delivers more efficient computing power, especially in the areas of machine learning, deep learning and high-performance computing.



2. Extra memory and bandwidth

The B300 is equipped with a 12-Hi HBM3E memory stack providing 288GB of memory and 8TB/s of bandwidth. The increased memory capacity enables it to handle larger datasets, making it particularly suitable for training large language models (LLMs) and handling long sequence inference tasks. Higher memory bandwidth accelerates data access and processing, reduces latency, and improves model inference and training efficiency.



3. Lower inference cost

Since the B300 supports processing larger batches and extended sequence lengths, it significantly reduces latency in the inference process and lowers inference costs. For example, the ability to triple inference efficiency allows the full computational power of each GPU to be utilized, thus reducing the cost required to generate the number of tokens per second.



4. Innovative interconnect technology

The B300 utilizes the 800G ConnectX-8 NIC, which provides twice the bandwidth of its predecessor for large-scale clusters and supports more PCIe lanes (48 instead of 32). This enables more efficient data sharing across multiple GPUs, significantly improving overall cluster throughput and computing efficiency, making it ideal for large-scale distributed and cloud computing applications.



5. More flexible supply chain and customization

Nvidia has changed its traditional sales model by no longer supplying complete server hardware, but instead offering core components such as SXM Puck modules and Grace CPUs to OEMs and ODMs, allowing customers to customize them according to their needs. This change brings higher flexibility and scalability to better adapt to the needs of different enterprises, especially for hyperscale data centers and cloud computing vendors, where customization can improve overall performance and efficiency.



6. Higher Scalability

For hyperscale organizations, the B300's NVLink 72 (NVL72) architecture enables 72 GPUs to collaborate on the same problem with low latency. Compared to traditional 8 GPU configurations, the B300 significantly improves batch size scalability, reduces costs and increases the intelligence of the inference chain. This makes the B300 computationally and economically efficient for large-scale inference tasks.



7. Efficient Cooling and Energy Management

Although the power consumption of the B300 series has increased (TDP of 1,400W), the B300 is able to dynamically allocate and adjust power between the CPU and GPU to maximize overall energy efficiency, thanks to a more efficient dynamic power allocation mechanism. Additionally, its design allows for a more efficient water cooling system, which helps reduce operating costs and improve system stability.



Value Proposition

Improved Computing Efficiency: The B300 Series is capable of handling larger datasets and more complex AI models, making it suitable for organizations that require high-performance computing, such as those in the areas of deep learning, inference services, large-scale AI model training, and other applications.

Reduced inference costs: With higher memory capacity and bandwidth, the B300 significantly reduces the cost per inference and improves economics, which is a huge value-add for cloud providers or organizations offering AI services.

Flexible customization: Nvidia's new supply chain model enables organizations to choose the most appropriate hardware configuration for their needs, reducing overall procurement costs and increasing flexibility.

Underpinning Hyperscale Computing: The B300 is a significant technology upgrade for data centers, cloud giants, and other hyperscale computing platforms (e.g., Amazon, Google, Meta), helping them scale compute capacity more efficiently and improve performance.



In summary, the B300 series not only brings significant improvements in multiple aspects such as performance, memory, bandwidth, and energy management, but also provides greater adaptability and scalability through a flexible supply chain and customized design, helping enterprises achieve higher efficiency and lower operating costs in large-scale computing and AI applications.",12-27-2024
"NVIDIA's $30 billion net retail buy-in in 2024 and when NVIDIA's market cap will overtake Apple's with the rise of artificial intelligence

Retail investors bought nearly $30 billion of NVIDIA stock this year through Dec. 17, making it the company with the largest retail inflow this year, according to Vanda research data. That's nearly twice as much as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a large-cap U.S. stock ETF, and is on track to overtake Tesla, which will be “Retail's Favorite Stock” in 2023

https://preview.redd.it/dui8qh7dc79e1.jpg?width=353&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=131be4eca17c3e1afa52c8f3b230213598115518

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda, said, “NVIDIA's stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla.”



　　



NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month, NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index's 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December, NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180% by the end of 2024. Today, its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, behind Apple.



　　



NVIDIA's retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda's data, NVIDIA's weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5% earlier this year to more than 10%. Currently, NVIDIA is the second-largest position for retail investors, behind Tesla. This year, net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885% from three years ago.

"Bullish on Intel boys, but why isn’t the market?1. Their GPU line is locking in entry level gamers to lock in VTube.
2. They have proceses that are on track to whip TSMC butt. Making Samsung eat their words like a depressed incel eating ice cream while watching CNN
3. They already have large customer base for their fab line, even getting an endorsement from Huang if China tries to blow up Taiwan. 
4. They have coordinated with Google to establish an open compute standard to make Nvidia lose its AI monopoly. Giving them a chance in leading AU waifu creation.
5. They lost AMD to server CPUs but their new line could benefit from the proprietary CPU trend to let them dominate again indirectly.
6. Meme in Chief wants American manufacturing jobs to boost their competitiveness in the US economy. Knocking out TSMC for 5 years and Samsung on lower capacity for 5.

Its valuation is half the size of AMD. It’s an absolute gigachad in the making. Why is the market not liking the company?

"Nvidia will moon - In Depth Benchmarking tests of AMD MX300 vs Nvidia H100 and H200 by SemiAnalysistl:dr - the world is as expected. AMD's software needs lots of hand holding and support, Nvidia's runs very well right out of the box. Nvidia maintains performance advantage in nearly every test run. [https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/](https://semianalysis.com/2024/12/22/mi300x-vs-h100-vs-h200-benchmark-part-1-training/)

  
Key Findings

\- Comparing on paper FLOP/s and HBM Bandwidth/Capacity is akin to comparing cameras by merely examining megapixel count. The only way to tell the actual performance is to run benchmarking.

\- Nvidia’s Out of the Box Performance & Experience is amazing, and we did not run into any Nvidia specific bugs during our benchmarks. Nvidia tasked a single engineer to us for technical support, but we didn’t run into any Nvidia software bugs as such we didn’t need much support.

\- AMD’s Out of the Box Experience is very difficult to work with and can require considerable patience and elbow grease to move towards a usable state. On most of our benchmarks, Public AMD stable releases of AMD PyTorch is still broken and we needed workarounds.

\- If we weren’t supported by multiple teams of AMD engineers triaging and fixing bugs in AMD software that we ran into, AMD’s results would have been much lower than Nvidia’s.

\- We ran unofficial MLPerf Training GPT-3 175B on 256 H100 in collaboration with Sustainable Metal Cloud to test the effects of different VBoost setting

\- For AMD, Real World Performance on public stable released software is nowhere close to its on paper marketed TFLOP/s. Nvidia’s real world performance also undershoots its marketing TFLOP/s, but not by nearly as much.

\- The MI300X has a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to the H100/H200, but training performance per TCO is higher on the MI300X on public stable releases of AMD software. This changes if one uses custom development builds of AMD software.

\- Training performance is weaker, as demonstrated by the MI300X ‘s matrix multiplication micro-benchmarks, and AMD public release software on single-node training throughput still lags that of Nvidia’s H100 and H200.

\- MI300X performance is held back by AMD software. AMD MI300X software on BF16 development branches have better performance but has not yet merged into the main branch of AMD’s internal repos. By the time it gets merged into the main branch and into the PyTorch stable release, Nvidia Blackwell will have already been available to everyone.

\- AMD’s training performance is also held back as the MI300X does not deliver strong scale out performance. This is due to its weaker ROCm Compute Communication Library (RCCL) and AMD’s lower degree of vertical integration with networking and switching hardware compared to Nvidia’s strong integration of its Nvidia Collective Communications Library (NCCL), InfiniBand/Spectrum-X network fabric and switches.

\- Many of AMD AI Libraries are forks of NVIDIA AI Libraries, leading to suboptimal outcomes and compatibility issues.

\- AMD customers tend to use hand crafted kernels only for inference, which means their performance outside of very narrow well defined use cases is poor, and their flexibility to rapidly shifting workloads is non-existent.",12-22-2024

"$SERV DD, long term play - Nvidia tendies?Sharing some of my own recent DD, found SERV only 5 days ago and have gone down the rabbit hole.  Conservatively estimating 200-1000% in the next 2 years, much greater if next year is successful.  Institutions are going to like this stock.

Market cap 560M 

Consistent uptrend after major buying in late July after Nvidia investment announced.  People like Jensen Huang tendies.



Summary - Leading autonomous / AI robotics company with a proven team having gotten through an alpha test with their early round of deliveries and is now expanding in 2026 with 2000 more units to scale.  Lower cost than using a car and reduces strain on streets and parking.  Exploring other robotics areas to build products in (think Starbucks, McDonald’s, etc) Major brand names investing and partnering with SERV.


Investors, Integration and News - Invested in by Nvidia (likely getting internal tech support)

Already integrated with Uber and 7-11


Recent events - 

October - Partnered with wing.com (alphabet / google venture).  Serv will drop packages to wing for pickup and delivery’s. The ground game of autonomous delivery chain.

November - acquired Vebu full stack restaurant automation allowing them to build offerings outside of delivery (Starbucks, McDonald’s)

Future - 2026 plan to deploy 2000 more units in progress.



Revenue or Total Addressable Market - massive, if you see the vision and they’re able to execute next year you’re buying a leader massive market potential.  Ali has stated these numbers I believe at 20 million deliveries a day, half of which are walking distance so 10 million a day in the US alone.  20-50 Million $ a day in delivery fees up for grabs in the US alone.  These fees will likely be lower than a driver (at first) prompting people to use the service.

They hope to turn 60-80 million next year from 2000 robots but if they get nowhere near that, the potential is there with other gains they will make advancing the product and getting out the kinks.  Once critical mass is reached and consumers accept these in an area you could imagine them running 24/7 moving things.  We are in the future.


Leader - with Nvidia, a working product that is expanding and weak competitors (e.g competitors drive their robots while serv will operate automously) expect Serv is well positioned to come out as a leader in the US autonomous delivery and restaurant automation.  


Design - care for aesthetics and design with the eyes / wall-e / shopping cart design, needed to make people feel comfortable with the future.


Institutions - started onboarding immediately and expect this to pick up heavily, and into next year with support of Nvidia and partnership with wing.  heavy buying volume from late July.   After cool off has been in constant uptrend from September and edging higher.


Costs - Robot build prices will come down with economies of scale.


Other Benefits - Research and Development in this robotics area poises them for additional spinoffs or pivots into new businesses or government contracts.",12-20-2024
"Nvidia Will Be the next Intel, Why I'm bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.",12-20-2024

"Broadcom’s Nvidia moment The rally in shares of chipmaker Broadcom after last week’s earnings is reminiscent of when Nvidia’s stock started to take off in 2023. Broadcom now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the AI era.

Broadcom shares have soared 38% since it reported, pushing its market value to almost $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the market for AI components it designs for data centers will be as big as $90 billion in three years. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that into reality.

""This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year and a half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” per Ken Mahoney of Mahoney Asset Management. Broadcom is showing investors that AI computing is so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia.

Broadcom stock is up 124% this year, set for its biggest annual gain ever. The stock is now priced at 38 times estimated earnings, suggesting the company has limited room for error. Nvidia, though, has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Its profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip.",12-17-2024
"NVDA vs AVGONVDIA vs Broadcom
I have a pretty big position in NVDA but am obviously not too thrilled with the stock performance since June.

While I am still bullish on NVIDIA and AI, there are a few things that make me pause

Apple doing its whole Apple Intelligence thing not planning to spend a single dollar with NVIDIA but rather building custom chips with Broadcom
Anthropic going all-in with Amazon's Trainium chips. In the past, big funding for AI startups meant a big check for Jensen. This didn't happen here and could set a precedent
Broadcom announcing that it will build 1 million XPU (ASIC) data centers with hyperscalers.
So while NVIDIA is clearly ahead of AMD, I don't like the shift to Broadcom ASIC chips. And to be honest it makes a lot of sense to me that Meta or Amazon would build their own chips to do stuff like recommendation engines.

So my question is: would you diversify/sell some NVDA stock to buy AVGO in order to be able to benefit both from the GPU and ASIC trends?",12-17-2024

"One thing I learned this year is to just trust my gut…I started late  and researched a bunch of stocks, palatir, soundhound, nvidia when it was still 200-300 pre split, Sofi, Lunr, Tesla at 200 in June July, the list goes on. I bitched out on everything because I have such tight funds and was worried of losing anything and now I’m looking at the year in review and my paper trades for those companies and I am KILLING MYSELF.

Any personal advice for continuing and not getting discouraged feeling like I am not gonna pick well again? 

Edit: didn’t expect this to really get attention and maybe only a couple replies not be on the front page? 

But thanks to everyone who gave me words of wisdom whether hard to hear or not. 

I’m just grateful for lessons and knowledge and perspective, stories etc; since I’m still a beginner and determined to learn this. 

Edit 2: To be clear I mean Trusting my gut based on charts, stats, earnings, valuation, market cap, growth potential, net operating income Etc. actual numerical data and news. 

I’m not just saying Ooooo that looks good I got a good feeling about this one! 

No that’s actually just roulette and I’m not tryna live like that. 

Also a big reason I didn’t take the risks is because money is so damn tight and I was trying to have more capital for making decent investments as opposed to smaller or less likely contracts; or shares for things I thought would maybe give me some return on now but probably still had some time or that I didn’t have enough to make more than a 10s of dollars on. so I did the safer thing.

"NVIDIA: A Victim of Its Own SuccessPeople wondering today why AVGO spiked but isn’t helping NVDA. In fact, there are now (idiotic) rumors that AVGO’s business booming is bad for NVDA.
Just so you guys are aware, Broadcom competes with Mavel in specialized custom GPU chips (which cost, say $400-500 million a chip). NVDA competes with AMD (although AMD is like miles behind) in non-specialized GPU chips which come with software (CUDA), development assistance etc for companies. 

NVDA and Broadcom DO NOT directly compete. Broadcom is NOT a threat to NVDA’s business. However, NVDA can be a huge threat to Broadcom. If NVDA tells big tech they will produce custom chips for them, Broadcom’s business will take a MASSIVE hit. Broadcom cannot compete with NVDA or even AMD in the non-specialized GPU chips section because there’s a software lock in, logistics base etc that NVDA has already developed.

Now, why is NVDA stock getting destroyed? Because it became too popular, and now trades so purely on swings in the market due to lots of retail traders etc, that good news barely moves it etc. There’s very little correlation. Expectations to NVDA now are so sky high—the expectation is that NVDA will always beat, so it’s hard for the stock to blow away expectations anymore. Compare that with Broadcom, which isn’t the most popular AI name (i.e. NVDA). That keeps overall sentiment much more tame for AVGO allowing it to blow out even though the quarter was mixed.

If news came out tomorrow that Blackwell is selling like hot cakes, stock still wouldn’t move on it. NVDA’s stock has become a victim of its own success—of its popularity. When I invested in the stock in 2018, it acted much more rationally than the stock price does nowadays.

"Englander just 10X'd his fund's stake in Walgreens Englander just 10X'd his fund's stake in this nearly 12%-yielding healthcare stock

But while Israel Englander has been sending shares of the hottest AI stock on the planet to the chopping block, he's been busy purchasing shares of pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), which is trading at levels last observed in the late 20th century and yielding more than 11.5%!

During the September-ended quarter, Englander's fund bought 5,138,342 shares of Walgreens, which increased its position by a whopping 953% in just three months! It should be noted that Millennium commonly hedges its common-stock holdings with put and call options, which is the case with both Nvidia and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

To say that things have been challenging for Walgreens would be nothing short of an understatement. It's facing growing online pharmacy pressure from the likes of Amazon, has endured complications (i.e., sizable writedowns) in its efforts to become a healthcare-services company, and has even had its operating results negatively impacted in select markets by theft.

Despite these challenges, which have slashed Walgreens Boots Alliance's share price by more than 90% since it hit an all-time high, Englander and his team have piled in.

One of the primary catalysts for Walgreens was the appointment of Tim Wentworth as CEO in October 2023. Whereas prior CEO Rosalind Brewer was a seasoned retail leader but lacked healthcare experience, Wentworth brings decades of healthcare leadership to the table. While his rip-off-the-Band-Aid approach has been a bit of a shock to Wall Street and investors, he's not been shy about laying out his long-term vision for Walgreens.

For the moment, the company is focused on bringing down costs, as well as promoting higher-margin initiatives. The plan is to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 U.S. stores over the next three fiscal years, which will lower its operating expenses and focus the company's efforts on areas of higher opportunity.

Furthermore, Wentworth intends to keep promoting its healthcare-services transition. Even though its partnership with and investment in VillageMD has led to sizable writedowns, Walgreens' chief believes the company is moving toward recurring profitability from its co-located primary care clinics.

As of this writing, Walgreens Boots Alliance is yielding an almost unfathomable 11.5%. However, with Walgreens in cost-cutting mode and the company attempting a multiyear turnaround, it wouldn't be surprising if this payout was cut again or shelved entirely to preserve cash.

While I do believe Walgreens Boots Alliance has the tools to effect a turnaround, it's going to be a slow process filled with plenty of potholes and speed bumps.

"NVIDIA Positioned for Growth Amid AI Boom Fueled by TSMC's Strong RevenueNVIDIA Positioned for Growth Amid AI Boom Fueled by TSMC's Strong Revenue

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a remarkable 34% increase in November revenue, reaching NT$276 billion ($8.48 billion) compared to NT$206 billion in November 2023. This surge underscores the continued strength of the semiconductor market, driven largely by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. As TSMC plays a pivotal role in manufacturing advanced semiconductors, including those designed by NVIDIA, this is a positive signal for NVIDIA’s growth trajectory.

A Strategic Partnership in AI

TSMC’s position as the primary manufacturer of NVIDIA’s advanced GPUs places NVIDIA at the heart of the AI boom. The robust demand for AI-driven applications, ranging from data centers to autonomous vehicles, highlights the increasing reliance on NVIDIA’s cutting-edge technology. TSMC’s strong revenue performance reinforces the sustained demand for NVIDIA-designed chips, which are integral to powering the AI revolution.

AI Momentum Driving Growth

The rising sales at TSMC indicate that NVIDIA’s AI-focused products continue to be in high demand despite macroeconomic challenges such as geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties. NVIDIA’s GPUs are critical for AI workloads, and the continued momentum in semiconductor sales reflects the growing adoption of AI technologies across industries.

NVIDIA’s reliance on TSMC for chip production aligns with the latter’s robust manufacturing capabilities, ensuring that NVIDIA remains well-positioned to meet global AI demands. This strategic partnership enables NVIDIA to leverage TSMC’s technological advancements, further solidifying its leadership in the AI space.

Industry Outlook and Strategic Advantage

While TSMC’s sales dipped 12.2% from October, the company’s year-over-year growth and the upward trend in AI adoption suggest a long-term positive outlook for NVIDIA. As analysts project NT$849 billion in TSMC revenue for the December quarter, meeting this target would further validate the strength of NVIDIA’s demand pipeline.

The AI sector’s explosive growth has been a key driver for NVIDIA, whose stock has already experienced significant gains in 2024. With TSMC’s revenue figures reinforcing the broader AI market momentum, NVIDIA remains a critical player poised to capitalize on this trend.

Conclusion: A Bright Future

TSMC’s strong performance is a bellwether for NVIDIA’s continued success in the AI market. As AI applications expand across industries, NVIDIA’s leadership in GPU innovation and its strategic relationship with TSMC position the company for sustained growth. Investors can view TSMC’s robust sales as a reinforcing factor for NVIDIA’s bright outlook in an increasingly AI-driven world.",12-10-2024
"Here's why I'm shorting Soundhound, a current WSB darlingAlright, degenerates, let’s talk about SOUN. If you’ve been printing tendies off this 600% rocket, congrats – I genuinely mean that (but also, fuck you). But here’s the thing: stocks don’t just go up forever, and Soundhound’s hype train has more red flags than a Chinese parade. The good news? You can still make money – big money – by embracing your inner gay bear and shorting this house of cards for all the reasons I’m about to tell you. [Position: Short 1,000 SOUN shares](https://imgur.com/a/5qWs8Sp)

**Tl;dr:**

* At the start of the year, Nvidia crossed the $100M threshold in securities holdings, requiring it to disclose its stock portfolio for the first time, thanks in large part to the ARM IPO. Among its disclosed investments was SOUN, which sent the stock soaring, trading its second-highest daily volume ever.
* Ever the opportunist, SOUN CEO Keyvan Mohajer issued a press release a month later hyping Soundhound’s integration with Nvidia DRIVE, despite Soundhound having been an ecosystem partner for over six months already. SOUN is pushed to new highs, with its highest daily trading volume on record.
* Shortly thereafter, speculation (mine) suggests a key customer informed SOUN of their intention not to renew a licensing agreement. High on tendies but short on time, Mohajer acquires a much larger, declining legacy business—Amelia. This move masked Soundhound's declining performance while propping up top-line revenue
* Naturally, WSB and retail traders ate it up, fueling the hype cycle

# Despite misleading headlines of “record” growth last quarter, Soundhound revenue is declining

Soundhound reported “record” Q3 revenue of $25.1M, up 89% year-over-year – but failed to mention that **all** of this “growth” came from having closed its acquisition of Amelia in the quarter, and in reality, **Soundhound’s business declined \~9%.**

Nowhere does Soundhound disclose how much revenue Amelia contributed in the quarter, but pretty much any regard with half a brain can figure it out from the merger filings. Amelia generated revenue of $45M in the first half of 2024, down 4% year-over-year (yes, the company they acquired ***is also declining***). Assuming the same negative growth rate in the second half, you get \~$44.7M. 

[Amelia Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/o6mvsq4dav5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f34074638912ededf539313815c93fb003f2b7)

We don’t have quarterly results for Amelia; however, we can observe that there isn’t any seasonality between the first and second half of 2023. This might seem odd if you’re familiar with SaaS, because there tends to be seasonality in Q4, but **Amelia is actually not a SaaS business**, despite best efforts to hide that fact. It sells on premise software licenses, and most of its revenue comes from maintenance services and professional services. Therefore, it’s fair to assume that revenue is recognized evenly over the quarters, so we can estimate Q3 2024 revenue for Amelia to be \~$22M (50% \* $44.7M). 

Since the acquisition closed in the middle of the quarter (8/8/2024), Soundhound was able to recognize \~58% of Amelia’s Q3 revenue and included this in its Q3 results. Of the $22M that Amelia generated in Q3, **$13M (58% \* $22M) of that was recognized by Soundhound as revenue generated by Amelia after 8/8/2024.** 

Backing this out of Soundhound’s “record” Q3 revenue, we can see that **the organic Soundhound business generated just \~$12M, declining \~9% year-over-year.**

[Soundhound Q3 Growth](https://preview.redd.it/yu7yewcf5v5e1.png?width=287&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a4772913c6de5115fd73ae89163d65190b96187)

Honestly, this is so basic and wrong that I can’t believe the Company had the balls to run with this headline. The stock isn’t widely covered, but not a single analyst brought it up on the earnings call or in their subsequent reports. Obviously it’s wrong to compare results that include revenue from an acquisition to a prior quarter that doesn’t - you’re not comparing the same company between periods. The reason it’s wrong is because in this case, **revenue for** **both** **Amelia AND Soundhound declined in the quarter, yet presented this way it appears that the combined business actually grew!** 

Even worse, Q4 guidance implies organic revenue **will decline by a staggering 27% YoY**. This isn’t a growth story; it’s a shrinking one, cleverly obscured by acquisition accounting.

[Soundhound Q4 guidance](https://preview.redd.it/tdflfz1j5v5e1.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=c27f8baa8ce37100bf9ab74aad5af901f0ffef70)

When I first saw these numbers, I thought something must be wrong with my math. Software companies don’t just decline after periods of rapid growth, they have recurring revenue that you can see declining way before it happens. But Soundhound is not a subscription software business at all - **95% of their revenue comes from product royalties that depend on the in-period sales of physical products like cars, smart speakers, and other devices.** 

[Soundhound revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/ruxcyb0s5v5e1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f2a5ffd325ab2615d2c0831f31a879b92cebb19)

This is not an isolated incident, but rather a pattern of misleading and selective disclosure by the company. 

# Amelia: A legacy boomer-tech business that now represents 2/3rds of Soundhound's revenue

Amelia, the acquisition that accounts for this “growth,” is a declining, legacy business. Founded in 1998 as IPSoft, Amelia’s has always specialized in automating back-office stuff with rudimentary chatbots. Amelia only recently began offering customer-facing chatbots, which it now claims to be leading AI Agents despite not being built on a modern LLM stack. 

Don’t take my word for it, you can see for yourself just how leading Amelia’s “conversational AI” is. Amelia counts American Heritage Credit Union as a proud customer, and you can go to their [website](https://www.americanheritagecu.org/), click Live Chat, and you’ll be taken to a dialogue box where you can chat with an Amelia powered agent - it even proudly displays the Amelia logo in the bottom right. Here’s how my conversation went: 

[Amelia Chat](https://preview.redd.it/r5ujc4en6v5e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb43d5aff2e3d3fb7da62ce343c93c9c2574cd12)

Nothing about this interaction was helpful, and it couldn’t answer basic questions like “What are some things you can help me with?”. **This is not AI, this is the same old, legacy chatbots powered by rudimentary decision trees that have been the standard for decades.** 

Contrast this experience with one powered by a truly leading AI Agent, Sierra. Sierra counts OluKai, a footwear retailer, as a customer, and you can chat with their AI Agent by going to the OluKai [website ](https://olukai.com/pages/contact)and clicking “Contact Us”. Here’s how my conversation went: 

[Sierra chat](https://preview.redd.it/b7txd7lq6v5e1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=088bfe0c601b8be9afd42b1acb3d6c2ecd3430e6)

The difference is night and day. The Sierra-powered agent is actually inferring and reasoning like a human agent would. And Sierra isn’t the only well funded competitor automating customer service operations with AI, there’s also Salesforce, Microsoft, Kore.ai, Yellow.ai, Parloa, and many others. 

None of this should be controversial or surprising - Amelia is boomer tech founded in the 90s, with loads of technical debt and miscalculated moves compounded over 25 years. 

But, let’s suppose Amelia truly were a leading, next generation conversational AI company and has been for decades. If that were the case, **why would revenue be declining despite selling into an environment where CEOs and CIOs are hyper-focused on how they can leverage Generative AI in their customer service operations?** That would be like losing money as a crypto trader in 2024 - the problem might be you. 

None of this would be too concerning for Soundhound if it wasn’t for the materiality of the acquisition and its size relative to Soundhound. Amelia is a much shittier business than Soundhound, but it’s also \~2x its size from a financial perspective. Soundhound’s financials will now be driven by the results of Amelia, and so too will the stock price. Here’s the side-by-side combined view of the income statement that was filed as part of the merger:

https://preview.redd.it/icz23hx07v5e1.png?width=1387&format=png&auto=webp&s=95b6f256e0975d1efcbd30088077176ed268f551

In 2023, Soundhound generated revenue of \~$46M, compared to Amelia which generated $93M. Going forward, Amelia will represent the majority of Soundhound’s revenue, good or bad. And I think it’s bad, because this is low quality, low margin revenue. **Amelia’s cost of revenue was $65.7M, leaving gross profit of $27.6M, for a whopping gross margin of 30%!** 

Seriously, do you know of any software company with 30% gross margins? YETI makes common household items out of metal and has better margins than this. The reason Amelia’s margins are so terrible is because **they don’t sell very much software**, despite their best efforts to hide that fact. Here’s the revenue composition that was disclosed in the merger filings: 

[Amelia revenue by type](https://preview.redd.it/hfmpse697v5e1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=8347bb1b070988f4e2b28a5fc51760fa07978b9c)

The vast majority of revenue came from “Subscription”, which, according to the company, includes SaaS revenue but also ongoing support and maintenance service revenue. **The reason they’re not breaking out SaaS revenue separately is because it would be immaterial and embarrassing to report,** so they’ve combined it with services and called the whole thing “Subscription”. 

Obviously these are not the same. SaaS and Licenses command 80%+ gross margins - very different from Amelia’s gross margin of 30%. 

# Soundhound's business model is fundamentally flawed and overexposed to risk

Soundhound isn’t a SaaS company. 95% of its revenue comes from product royalties, heavily dependent on the sales of physical goods like cars and smart speakers. This is not a recurring software model; their revenue is highly susceptible to fluctuations from the sales of its own customers. 

Adding to the problem is customer concentration: **62% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from just two automotive customers**, likely Hyundai and Kia. If either customer scales back purchases, Soundhound’s revenue will crater.

https://preview.redd.it/lwhmohjk7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=684e25adcd9bcb7a1aa1d565549e32196a4c429e

Worse, only 15% of Soundhound’s revenue comes from US customers. Since most of Soundhound’s revenue comes from product royalties, and most of these royalties come from customers located outside the US, **Soundhound is exposed to US tariff and trade policy that could negatively impact the sales of its foreign customers.**

https://preview.redd.it/zgvxxjan7v5e1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f3483c49c95c31b3f348a3f0a1f8f49bd1f87d5

# The NVIDIA hype is an overblown fantasy perpetuated by Soundhound's CEO

If you’ve been riding the SOUN hype train, you’re probably thinking: “But what about Nvidia!” And sure, Nvidia’s name being linked to Soundhound gave this stock rocket fuel. But here’s the cold, hard truth: this “partnership” is anything but strategic and it's more smoke than substance.

Yes, Nvidia owns a small stake in Soundhound – just 1.7M common shares – but this is not a new development. Nvidia first invested in Soundhound back in 2017 as part of a [private $75M venture round](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/soundhound-raises-75m-to-bring-its-voice-enabled-ai-everywhere/), long before the stock ever traded publicly. This investment was disclosed again during Soundhound’s [2021 de-SPAC process](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840856/000121390021059758/ea150505ex99-2_archimedes.htm), yet retail investors and media only took notice when [Nvidia filed its first-ever 13-F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000021/xslForm13F_X02/information_table.xml) report in February 2024, disclosing its SOUN holdings. The market collectively lost its mind, sending SOUN up 67% in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/3o6rpulq7v5e1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=224e650fcb4281072d203301362e0f74fdb2a786

Prior to this, the **one and only time** NVIDIA was ever mentioned in any of Soundhound’s earnings transcripts was in Q2 2023, when CEO Keyvan Mohajer rattled off a list 9 “strategic” investors, NVIDIA among them:

https://preview.redd.it/0y6gvezt7v5e1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=379365fe89c9d7410816d3ea0dc662c10d27180e

Just one month after the NVIDIA 13-F filing, in an effort to capitalize on the hype, Soundhound issued a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318067099/en/) about its integration with Nvidia’s DRIVE platform for in-vehicle voice assistants. During its next earnings call, **Kevyon mentions NVIDIA six times**, describing the “collaboration” as a “very big milestone” for in-vehicle generative AI. While Kevyon positioned the “partnership” as new, **Soundhound has been an NVIDIA DRIVE partner since at least October 2023** based on a trip to the Wayback machine

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Oct 2023](https://preview.redd.it/4toe71qx7v5e1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596eeddf44e08e19aaf7dd7c321a3d886ad4ea1)

But let’s examine the facts. [Nvidia’s DRIVE platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/) is an end-to-end development platform for autonomous vehicles, designed to attract a broad ecosystem of partners. It’s not an exclusive club. Nvidia’s DRIVE Partner Ecosystem website lists over 100 partners, **including Soundhound’s closest competitor** (Ironically I'll be banned for mentioning its ticker). Nvidia even published a [blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/cerence-generative-ai-in-car-experience/) showcasing its offerings on the DRIVE platform – something it hasn’t done for Soundhound. **If this “partnership” were truly transformative, wouldn’t Nvidia at least acknowledge Soundhound publicly?**

[NVIDIA DRIVE Partners, Current \(Cerence\)](https://preview.redd.it/c0iczsy28v5e1.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a889071b541ebc556505e51c7e2a5b0ec9e2ec)

The reality is, Soundhound’s integration with DRIVE is one of many among hundreds of partners. This isn’t a deep, strategic relationship – it’s a basic vendor integration, the kind that doesn’t move the needle for Nvidia. **Soundhound hyped it up because they knew the name recognition alone would excite retail investors, but the lack of reciprocation from Nvidia tells a different story.**

This isn’t a transformative partnership; it’s an opportunistic narrative crafted to milk the Nvidia association for all it’s worth. Don’t fall for the hype.

# Soundhound has obfuscated the true price it paid for Amelia, which is much higher than headline reports of $80M (as much as 3x higher)

In its [press release](https://www.soundhound.com/newsroom/press-releases/soundhound-ai-acquires-amelia-significantly-expanding-its-scale-and-reach-in-conversational-ai-across-new-verticals-and-hundreds-of-enterprise-brands/) announcing the acquisition, Soundhound characterized the purchase price as “$80 million in cash and equity, with partial payment and assumption of Amelia’s debt, as well as future earnout potential…”

While there’s nothing wrong with this statement, it’s unusual that the number they decided to disclose ($80M) wasn’t the full transaction price. Now, you may not believe this is misleading, but it literally misled Techcrunch, which wrote up a story on the acquisition, announcing it as an $80M deal. 

https://preview.redd.it/zv6qjd798v5e1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1b556d4a600df16dfc48a0a38d59c79ce40bf64

The details can be found in the [stock purchase agreement](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/121390024066351/2?cik=1840856), but here’s the summary: After accounting for the $80M upfront payment, $70M in paid-down debt, $39.7M in assumed debt, $8.6M in transaction expenses, and up to $90M in equity earnouts, the total acquisition cost could hit $288M (and much higher at these current prices)

This price tag is staggering for a declining business with abysmal gross margins. Soundhound’s selective disclosure of Amelia’s cost highlights a troubling pattern: management glosses over bad news and amplifies good news, regardless of the facts.

# Implied valuation for Soundhound is astronomical, even by WSB standards

I won’t spend much time on this topic, because honestly, who cares? Prices go up and down all the time. But there’s an important nuance here, and it has to do with how Amelia is valued with the rest of Soundhound

Soundhound currently trades at an enterprise value of $5.4 billion, or 32.8x forward revenue. But most of this revenue comes from Amelia, and $1 from Amelia is worth much less than $1 from Soundhound (that’s how Soundhound was able to acquire a business with much more revenue than itself). 

We don’t know what Amelia is worth today, but we can approximate it as the maximum amount Soundhound could end up paying for it ($288M). After all, that’s what Soundhound just paid for the asset in August. 

With this information we can back into the implied value of the core Soundhound business, which is $5.1 billion at a revenue multiple of 68x.

For comparison, Palantir only trades at a lofty 2025 revenue multiple of 49x.

"My thesis on INTC going into 2025I am going to add my technological and geopolitical fundamentals here, because I think these are going to be important factors heading into 2025. Disclaimer: I own 575 shares of Intel at an average PpS of $29.30

I think most analysts are forgetting that the next president is the same guy who is trying to block the acquisition of US steel by Nippon steel at all costs, regardless if it makes financial sense or not because he wants to retain as much American Manufacturing as possible and wants it to succeed.

Most of the ""AI revolution"" has happened over the past 4 years where the administration had no problem letting foreign chip manufacturing take the lead. Intel is competing with TSMC, and TSMC receives massive subsidies and discounts from the Taiwanese government which dwarf the 7.9B (which was even reduced) from the US government. On top of that, the US government is also giving slightly less in subsidies, 6.6B, to TSMC to build in the US. So really, the current administration is not giving Intel an advantage over TSMC. The most effective thing that they could do is levy tariffs against Taiwan, which the next president has gone on record stating he wishes to do, instead of subsidies. This would increase demand for American chip manufacturing; while TSMC can manufacture in the US, CoWoS packaging is done outside of the US, in either Malaysia or Taiwan, and would cause the product to be subject to tariffs.

In the chip design space, Intel is hopelessly behind on GPUs compared to Nvidia, and now Apple, Amazon, OpenAI and others are designing their own chips and using TSMC for manufacture. Intel still dominates the CPU space, but your average datacenter rack might have 10/20+ GPUs for each CPU. AMD is also a viable alternative to Intel for CPUs, and as such takes about 25% of the market. Intel's only way to compete in the GPU space is in the cost performance market, which mainly targets budget gaming, crypto mining, and cheap datacenter. The newest release of the ""Battlemage"" B580 is expected to compete with Nvidia's 4060 at the under $300 MSRP market, which are lofty goals. Nvidia and AMD still have offerings in these spaces but they are not lucrative ones. So Intel is basically competing to be a 3rd rate designer in the US, while they still have the CPU lead it matters a lot less for the lucrative markets right now.

It's clear that on the design front, Intel is not going to receive much help to be successful. While this is their core business and majority of revenue, it is a business they are falling behind substantially compared to others. Design demand is GPUs and they are late to this party. Revenue for products is expected to stagnate or decline unless they have a competitive GPU offering.

However, the US needs to have a domestic cutting edge chip manufacturing supply chain. It has expressed as much as a result of the 2022 supply chain shortage when we realized that letting TSMC manufacture 90% of the world's sub 5nm chips was a bad idea. That was the motivation behind passing the CHIPS act; Pat Gelsinger was instrumental in advising the current administration for this. The method for doing so has left a lot to be desired; Pat himself even expressed as much given the delay in fund disbursement, which in all fairness was only accelerated as a result of the election result and comments from republicans that they wanted to repeal the act.

TSMC is not allowed to have the latest node fabricated in the US by law of the Taiwanese government. This is so that the country keeps its ""Silicon Shield"", the dependence globally to have manufacturing be done there which keeps Taiwan protected from China. But Intel has no such limitation. And TSMC is not able to fufill 100% of the orders for its customers; it is aggressively building more fabs to keep up with the ever increasing demand of AI. This demand exists for Intel to take part of.

So, Intel in the next administration will have a tremendous amount of support for its Foundry, not Products, side of the business. This leaves Intel with a potential alternative to many of the scenarios analysts predict: It could solely dedicate to Foundry and sell off its Products division, most likely to AMD which shares the x86 architecture already and is solely focused on design. This would allow Intel to become a Foundry for external customers without having a conflict of interest, which I suspect is keeping them from customers. The CHIPS act stipulates that Intel has to retain a majority stake of Foundry but NOT Products, so this does not prevent Intel from dedicating itself to Foundry, which is what the US wants.

I think Pat was waiting for the right climate to do this and it is coming soon. It is sad he did not stay long enough to see it happen. If Intel received the same amount of support from the US government that the Taiwanese government gave to TSMC, and was able to win external customers as a result of Tariffs, it could become the US TSMC. Much of this hinges on the 18A and later 14A nodes which are competitive with TSMC 2nm, which is the current cutting edge. But I think this is the desire of Intel and the next administration, and so they will work towards this goal. To diminish foundry would be a slow death for Intel. That is why I am still looking forward to Intel in 2025.

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, it is also entirely possible for Qualcomm to buy Intel's Products division. I think they expressed as much earlier this year, but being they are primarily ARM I am not sure if it would be a good fit.",12-07-2024

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

" NVDA's stock is down 10% in a week, is he still worth following?NVIDIA reported impressive earnings, with quarterly revenues reaching $35 billion, up 94% year-over-year, with even stronger growth in the data center business, up 112%. Net income doubled to $20 billion and the company showed a strong outlook for future quarters, slightly exceeding market expectations. However, while growth remains impressive, fourth-quarter expected revenue of $37.5 billion is growing at a slower pace, well below the strong growth seen in previous quarters (122%, 262%, 265%). Since then, market concerns about a possible trade war in China have intensified, causing shares to fall

Despite the slowing growth concerns, analysts believe NVIDIA's fundamentals remain solid. The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence and its production capacity constraints mean that it still has plenty of room to grow its revenues. The stock is expected to reach $170 in the next three months. However, while NVIDIA still has investment potential, a number of other AI stocks could offer higher returns in the shorter term and are worth keeping an eye on.

"Where are future returns even supposed to come from? Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market.

Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

Of course, no financial advice. I’m long 800 shares and loading as much as I possibly can.",11-28-2024

"NVDA is about to take off (technically speaking): why I feel more confident following my previous post Greetings,

I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright?

I for one will be talking about NVDA.

I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there.

And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast

Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable.

And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H"").

If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing.

This mean stock go up.

Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm...

"$Dell Earnings I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. 

Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house. ",11-26-2024

**Potential Positive Factors:**

1. **Strong Demand for AI-Optimized Servers:** Dell has experienced significant growth in its Infrastructure Solutions Group, particularly in AI-optimized servers. In the second quarter, this segment achieved record revenue of $11.65 billion, a 38% increase year-over-year, driven by partnerships with companies like Coreweave and Elon Musk's xAI, which utilize Dell hardware for AI infrastructure. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/dell-beats-second-quarter-revenue-estimates-driven-by-ai-server-demand-2024-08-29/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
2. **Strategic Partnerships and Product Launches:** Dell's collaboration with Nvidia has bolstered its AI capabilities, including the shipment of server racks based on Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 Blackwell system. These advancements position Dell to capitalize on the growing AI market. [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/dell-stock-earnings-501814ec?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
3. **Positive Analyst Outlooks:** Analysts have expressed optimism about Dell's performance. Morgan Stanley reiterated an ""Overweight"" rating with a $154 price target, citing expected momentum building into 2025.

"PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD]On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",11-25-2024
"Prepare for a significant NVDA pullback until the company reports more conclusively positive numbers on Blackwell My breakdown touches upon:  

1)        Overall market context; 2) NVDA specific policy changes coming under Trump administration 

Overall market context is important, especially if we are headed for a correction or a consolidation period after the period of exuberance we have seen across asset classes. 

The overall market has largely yawned at potential tariffs, regulatory framework, and possibility of more export controls to Chinese market that could be enacted under a second Trump administration. Ex Goldman analyst Robin Brooks has alerted that markets are discounting the prospect of tariffs and how their effects could be really damaging for equities in 2025 ([https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst](https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/42134031/markets-got-it-wrong-after-elections-prospects-of-tariffs-not-good-for-equities-vs-dollar-says-ex-goldman-sachs-analyst)). I don’t know whether there is hyperbole here, and if tariffs will actually cause pain for stocks, but it is at least worrying that the market has not seemed to care at all now that we know Trump will take office in January.

Goldman Sachs’ forecast shows robust 2.5% growth for the US economy in 2025, with slightly worst results if Trump enacts a 10% tariff on all imports. ([https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/2025-outlook-will-tailwinds-trump-tariffs/OutlooksFinalTranscript.pdf)) Frankly, I believe Goldmans’ forecasting model is overly optimistic for two reasons. First, their estimates does not include a 10% across-the-board tariff on all imported goods, which Trump campaigned on. Nor does it include a scenario in which a large deportation program – both of which could have the effect of suppressing economic growth if implemented.

Wage growth has largely slowed and consumers would feel fatigued if a new bout of inflation rips across the economy—this would definitely have an impact on earnings. On top of this, a weakening labor market seems to threaten consumers’ comfortability with rising prices again.

One could argue that Trump’s immigration policies, including his plan for a large deportation initiative could see a tighter labour market, and rising wages that could counter a weakening labor market and slowing wage growth. But it’s important to be cognizant of the fact that tariffs would happen instantly, whereas deportations take time, and their effects would not be felt immediately throughout the economy.

Now that I’ve covered the overall market context, let’s get specific on NVDA.

Since NVDA reported earnings last week, the stock price has seesawed in pre-market trading as well as during trading hours. There has been plenty of pontification by market analysts either discounting or raising concerns about slowing sales growth and lower guidance going forward. The stock ended last week largely down, with significant selling happening on Friday.

But I want to focus on what’s in store for NVDA under a the administration.

Howard Lutnick, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump as Secretary of Commerce and USTR, has signaled his commitment to intensifying export controls on advanced semiconductors and related technologies to China. Lutnick’s statements and policy positions suggest a focus on maintaining U.S. dominance in critical technologies, particularly in the semiconductor sector, as a countermeasure to China's rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and military applications.

In a recent interview, Lutnick described semiconductors as ""the cornerstone of America's technological edge"" and emphasized that ""export controls are not merely economic tools but strategic weapons to protect our national security."" He has voiced strong support for continuing and expanding the Biden administration's measures, including targeting AI chips and semiconductor manufacturing tools.

Under Lutnick's guidance, policies could further restrict sales of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips to China. He has highlighted concerns about these chips enabling advanced AI capabilities that could be leveraged by the Chinese military. Lutnick stated, ""We cannot afford to let cutting-edge American technology become a tool for our adversaries,"" signaling potential restrictions on Nvidia and other U.S. tech firms developing high-performance semiconductors.

 The implications of Lutnick's policies could be significant. Stricter controls on exports, including modifications to loopholes that allowed companies like Nvidia to tailor products for the Chinese market, might accelerate China's efforts toward semiconductor self-sufficiency. U.S. firms could face reduced revenues, but Lutnick argues that ""short-term sacrifices are essential for long-term strategic security”.

In addition, we cannot discount the Biden administration making last minute policy moves to box in opponents and make it harder for the new incoming administration to deviate. This has already been reported by Reuters ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chamber-commerce-sees-new-us-export-crackdown-china-email-says-2024-11-22/)). According to this report, the Biden administration is set to enact new regulations could make up to another 200 Chinese chip companies subject to a trade restriction list that bars most U.S. suppliers from shipping goods to the targeted firms. This news broke on Friday, but ten minutes before the market closed. If this is correct, it will put price pressure on the semiconductor sector, which could affect NVDA as well.

 I really do believe given this context, we are entering a period where NVDA could suffer, at least until we have more clarity on tariffs, export control regulations, and Blackwell sales numbers which won’t be reported on for some time.

The largest NVDA drawdowns that have happened recently (March-April; June-August; August-September) averaged anywhere between 21-30%. Smaller, more muted corrections have also occurred of around 10% in the stock since. A similar effect here (10% or so from its high of 152.88 would bring shares close to 137, and break through a key support level. A larger plunge could see it closer to 120 or below.

All in all, a dip here would be a good opportunity to buy up shares at a discounted price.

 I will be holding cash for buying on what I believe will be significant dips coming in the coming weeks, in the lead-up to inauguration and what will be a flurry of announcements as Trump will want to signal change and do so in true Trump fashion: loudly.

"NVDA may see red next weekThis isn’t bear porn and I’m going to get flamed for this one, but I think NVDA has a red week coming.  Earnings were very good, beating on both EPS and rev, but guidance came in conservative.  Gross margins were also down slightly to 74.6% from 75.1% in the previous quarter(still insane numbers).  The issue with this slight deceleration is that the stock is priced for exponential growth like we’ve been seeing for a couple years now.  That ridiculous growth may be slowing down a little for now, and their new Blackwell chips are still rolling out.  We don’t know what kind of revenue those will bring in yet.  The stock got plenty of price hikes post earnings, but nothing too significant(160-170’s for the most part).  It just seems like the train is slowing down a bit.  

As far as the chart goes, it has tried to break and hold $149-150 7 times since November 6.  It briefly broke over the day after earnings, but was quickly bitch slapped back below that threshold.  IMO, this earnings report was the catalyst that it needed to get over that resistance, and it has clearly failed to do so. So the question is: where do we go from here?  We’re right on the trend line that it’s held since September 6.  We could go higher, but earnings failed to impress the market, and it doesn’t seem like we have enough gas to pump it higher just yet.  We saw some significant selling pressure today without any buyers stepping in EOD.  I think that trend continues Monday and we break the trend line.  That is a solid red daily candle today, and I expect to see a gap down and another candle just like that on Monday. I would love to see it hit the 100 day EMA(right around $130) and bounce from there.  Thats definitely the spot to load up on calls if you’re still bullish(which you should be).  

One more risk over the next few days and weeks:  geopolitical tensions.  Normally we just ignore everything Putin says, but the escalation of launching an Oreshnik ICBM and hitting Dnipro can not be ignored.  NATO is holding an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss this event.  There have been many escalations recently, with multiple countries now directly involved in the conflict.  Monitor it and tread carefully. ",11-23-2024

"Why I am bullish on SMCI. #Calls SMCI has been on a roller coaster this year but personally I think this one is set to be one of the greatest comebacks we have witnessed in a while.

Reasons why I am bullish on SMCI.

1. The company has launched next-generation products utilizing NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs and CPUs, which are expected to drive demand from AI and cloud service providers. Early testing has been promising, and production is ramping up
2. SMCI remains a key supplier for AI servers and infrastructure, benefiting from the explosive growth of AI and data center investments by major companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Its servers, including liquid-cooled models, are crucial for high-efficiency AI applications
3. Despite recent challenges (which many other companies have went through may I add), SMCI's underlying business remains solid. Demand for its products is robust, driven by the need for scalable, energy-efficient server solutions in AI and cloud applications. SMCI has made significant progress toward regulatory compliance, including hiring BDO USA as its auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq to avoid delisting.
4. Recent insider purchases totaling 1.51 million shares indicate confidence in the company’s future prospects. Insider buying is often viewed as a positive signal regarding management's belief in the company’s growth potential and frankly my belief as well.
5. The company’s partnership with leading firms in AI and cloud services ensures a steady demand pipeline. Expanding client adoption of its innovative server solutions further strengthens its market position.

Personally I am extremely bullish. 1.51M shares bought is absolutely mind blowing they must know something retail doesn't and the stock is trading at a huge discount right now.

Calls it is.

As of Wednesday, Nvidia’s stock accounts for **2️⃣4️⃣**% of the index’s gains this year.

The result is that when Nvidia does well, animal spirits 🦍 rise across the market. Bank of America analysts had calculated this week that investors were expecting a **1% index move** in response to Nvidia’s earnings — greater than the shift they expect from US inflation data later this month.

 In the short term, Nvidia has the enviable benefits of both scale and scarcity. 

Supply constraints keep prices high, and the company says demand for its new Blackwell chips will exceed its expectations of 'several billion dollars' in the current quarter. 

💸 Meanwhile, governments from Saudi Arabia to Denmark are seeking to build their own state-backed artificial intelligence initiatives, so while Silicon Valley depends on Nvidia, the reverse is becoming less true.

 That suggests the virtuous circle can continue. Whether that justifies a valuation of **3️⃣4️⃣** times forward earnings is up for grabs. Cisco stock, after a moment on top of the world, plunged during the dotcom crash, and never recovered.

 While Nvidia’s customers are paying hand over fist for chips driven by the promise of AI, it remains to be seen whether their customers — and their customers’ customers — will pay up for the resulting services too.💡

Nvidia has two things in its favour. First, its valuation is far behind the **1️⃣3️⃣0️⃣** times earnings Cisco enjoyed in 2000. Second, Huang has the benefit of hindsight and lavish profitability. Cisco’s earnings were **2️⃣0️⃣**% of its sales before the dotcom crash; Nvidia’s are nearly **6️⃣0️⃣**%.

 Spend that wisely, and his company will move the market for some time to come.""(+++Opinions are my own. Not investment advice. Do your own research.+++)",11-21-2024

"NVDA timeNVIDIA will report post-earnings after the bell today. In fact, I think NVIDIA's results will have more of an impact on the S&P than U.S. jobs data, inflation data or even the Fed meeting

I won't just focus on NVIDIA's last quarter's sales. I want to know if the chipmaker's next-generation Blackwell chip can maintain or even solidify its dominance in the AI chip industry

"NVIDIA Q3 earnings preview: strong AI chip growth, but supply chain and tariff risks raise market concerns?Nvidia is set to report its Q3 earnings after the close of trading today, an earnings report that will be crucial for investors to understand the latest developments in the AI industry.Nvidia, the world's largest publicly traded company by market capitalisation, has benefited from the AI tech



According to the current speculation, Nvidia's third-quarter revenue (EPS) is expected to be $0.74 for $33.2 billion, up 83% year-over-year, respectively. Of this, revenue from the data centre division is expected to reach $29 billion, an increase of 100% from the same period last year. Gaming Revenue



Investors are not only focusing on the financial performance of the third quarter, but also on whether Nvidia will adjust its earnings estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts are still predicting $37 billion for the fourth quarter. However, even if the earnings report exceeds expectations, Nvidia's stock will still hit $37 billion. The possible decline could be partly due to the market its earnings expectations have trended higher, or investors



Also, Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips are expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for the company, but shipments of the series have been delayed, mainly due to overheating issues affecting servers, which may be its installations in data centres. , the current government department may impose tariffs on global products, especially on chips made in Taiwan, giving Nvidia levy uncertainty. Since most of Nvidia's chips are made by Taiwan's TSMC, the tariffs could raise the price of AI chips, which could affect its profit margins or pass the cost on to customers.



These signs could lead to a less-than-expected market reaction. It could create uncertainty for Nvidia's future. Do you think these potential risks will affect Nvidia's long-term growth?

A small write up on the company:

ASML is the Dutch manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipments and lithographic machines.

They have the EUV [Extreme Ultra Voilet] technology to produce machines to craft 5 nm and smaller size chips. These are the latest AI chips used for very high performance tasks like training LLM models etc.

Nvidia and other foundaries (TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix) depend on ASML machines.

But their workhorse is DUV [Deep Ultra Voilet] technology which is used for manufacturing non AI chips and far exceed requirements in form of less intensive but more utilitarian forms like house hold appliances, cars, home laptops, computers etc.

Chinese have developed/acquired DUV technology and are able to produce upto 7 nm chips at a fraction of the cast. DUV machine may be used to produce 5 nm chips but it will lack density and in computing power. Some unconfirmed reports have stated that Chinese have made significant progress in EUV technology but we are yet to see an actual proof of that. 

US govt have put restrictions on US, EU, Korea and Taiwan based chip manufacuturers to provide latest AI chips or manchines to manufacture latest AI chips.",11-20-2024

"$VRT ➡️ S&P 500: Coming SoonVertiv ($VRT) has been ripping all year and is up 190% YTD fueled by continuous AI & data center demand.  I think it has a high likelihood of being **added to the S&P 500 during the Q4 rebalancing** which will be announced Dec 6th. I'll share a brief overview of $VRT and then my thinking behind the S&P 500 inclusion.

*Position*: $VRT shares, 2025 & 2026 leaps

# Company Analysis

**High level company overview:**  
[Vertiv Holdings Co.](https://www.vertiv.com/en-us/) *engages in the design, manufacture, and service of critical digital infrastructure technology that powers, cools, deploys, secures and maintains electronics that process, store and transmit data. It also offers power management products, thermal management products, integrated rack systems, modular solutions, and management systems for monitoring and controlling digital infrastructure.* 

**Leadership team:**

**Financial Overview**:  
Strong financials across the board and continue to raise guidance. 2024 guidance confirmed, data is here:

Net Sales: $7,805M, organic up 14%  
Adj. Operating Profit: $1,485M  
Adj. Operating Margin: 19.0%, up 370 bps  
Adj. Free Cash Flow: $1,000M

Another overall view from today's investor day presentation, the full deck can be found here: [Nov 18 - Investor Day](https://s23.q4cdn.com/959471387/files/doc_presentations/Vertiv-2024-Investor-Event-Presentation.pdf).

Fundamentally I think they have some **key advantages** that will allow for them to continue to dominate the market:

(1) AI-Demand & Margin Expansion: Multiple levers for continued further expansion of adjusted operating margin to \~25% in 2029 (Slide 14 & 36)  
(2) Product Leadership: Vertiv services provide unmatched critical digital infrastructure support (Slide 26-28)  
(3) Flexible Capital: $12.5B of capital deployment through 2029. Up from $6.5B at Nov 2023 Investor Day (Slide 48)  
(4) Energy Demand: Power and cooling capabilities are already crucial today, as energy demand surges, efficiency and cost will become a major factor

**Risks**  
\- AI Bubble: tbh I'm not a believer in this narrative but its something to consider since their sales are driven by AI related companies  
\- $NVDA: $VRT trades with $NVDA (so does the market in a way) but if you pull up the charts there is high correlation. Also $NVDA ER is tomorrow  
\- Valuation: They trade at a 81.86 PE ratio 

# S&P 500 Inclusion

The S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.

S&P rebalancing presents an opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is potential for a \~5-10% price increase. In short, the rebalance forces institutions who follow certain indexes to buy the stock as it is now in the index & generally there is a positive impact on company's reputation.

Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable. Negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility.

Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):  
Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%

**Why Vertiv ($VRT)?**

* Thematic fit: the index is focused on representing the best large/mid cap companies in the US and $VRT fits the industrial/energy category (the industry will get more love under the new administration), it fits the innovation/technology aspect, and of course the energy/AI theme 
* Solid earnings and growth: self-explanatory in the company financial analysis above
* Strong momentum: this is important and imho, an underrated factor. A great example of this is Palantir ($PLTR) which btw pumped like 10% off of the news. Now I know r/wallstreetbets has a love/hate relationship with $PLTR but put that aside for now (it was added to the index around $35)

**Rebalance Timeline**: [Q4 2024 ](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/ICE_NYSE_2024_Yearly_Trading_Calendar.pdf)  
\*based on the usual schedule, check the website for official announcements

* Quarter End Date: Dec 31
* Announcement Date: Early December (typically 1st week)
* Rebalance Date: Dec 20 (typically 3rd Friday)

# Closing Note

I will be waiting until after NVIDIA reports earnings on 11/20 to make any adjustments to this trade or to rethink my thesis. Would recommend this especially if you do not already have a position in $VRT. I could be completely wrong. God speed!


POST NVIDIA ER UPDATE (Edit 11/21)
- $NVDA great earnings, beat expectations, and currently trading green in the pre market
- $VRT might not pull back at all since the momentum is continuing and they literally talked about the need for data centers and cooling solutions on the ER
- IF and that’s an IF we pull back, look for the $127/$130 level to buy in

"ASML, they make the machines that make the semiconductors, orders have slowed and share price has tumbled, is it now undervalued?They make the shovels (machines) that mine the gold (semiconductors). Therefore once companies have the machines they don’t immediately need new ones, hence the hype around this company reduced as people realised its profitability isn’t as exponential as Nvidia. However, they lead the market in terms of the size of semiconductor their machines can produce and are only ever another set of orders away from a surprise upside on earnings and when advances are made to the technology companies will need the new machines to stay competitive.

I’d like to share some thought.

**My label**

1.Long-term investing on the product of market

**Important material I’ve read**

1.Youtube: How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio

2.The Little Book of Common Sense Investing

3.Psycology of money

**Thought**

Part of my money is on sp500 related. Besides this, I still did some stock picking, which is I really want to share.

1.Nvdia:Never sold out, keep buying

Three reasons: 

a.I deeply believe productivity gain is the most powerful drive for economy growth(read it from How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio). 

b.GenAI dramatically improves productivity.

c.Nvidia is the cornerstone of the GenAI

2.PAN:Hold 

I bought some last Dec. In March, the CEO announced the strategy change of the company, the stock dropped by 30%。This does not affect me at all since I am in this industry and their strategy is not bad.

Now the price came back even higher.

3.Tesla: Bought below 200 and then sold out after “We robot” event. I was disappointed on the bland event

We all know what is going on now. LOL

4.Crowdstrike:

Sold out after outage.

**I really don’t understand it.. How come the stock price of company with this huge mistake still came back. The customers still believe in the reliability of the company product? or other competitors are so behind?**

This black swan event can dramatically affect my cognization.

5.Palantir

Seriously considered and decided not buy. Now it is 6x.

6.Micron, Dell, qualcomm

Mediumlconsidered and decided not buying it.

Since I watch news everyday, I noticed some good quarterly report and  stock gain. so want to jump in.

I don’t feel strong confidence, the drive is from its recent performance and their AI-related product, but I still feel doubt of them and don’t have strong internal acknowledge of the products.

===

This year really get me deeper understanding of my own mindset and the market

Big lessons:

When you don’t have rational confidence of a company, you are much emotionally affected by single event and the market. 

Business acumen: should’ve seriously considered Tesla before election. 

Biggest Mistake:

I still got tricked into making more transaction due to make more money mindset.",11-19-2024

NVIDIA is helping Google to accelerate the quantum computing devices,11-18-2024
"NVIDIA is next-gen Blackwell chips delayed again, exposed to overheating issues？NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned.

Blackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers.

To address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems. While such engineering improvements are a routine step in large-scale technology releases, they also further delayed product delivery.

I think the overheating issues with the Blackwell chips reflect the technical complexities and challenges in the development of advanced AI hardware, but NVIDIA is responding to these issues with design adjustments and enhanced collaboration. While the delays may have some negative impact on customers and NVIDIA's results in the short term, the Blackwell chips are still expected to be a significant driver of the AI and HPC markets as optimizations are completed and products are shipped at scale.",11-18-2024
"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise valueHello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

https://preview.redd.it/6povwnwzcn1e1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ebbefc794996c48be08cbb0144c0ee9d675cd

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

Happy investing!",11-18-2024

"Jen-Hsun Huang's Dialogue with Masayoshi Son: Japan's New AI Pie, Arm's AI Ambition and NVIDIA's New East Asia OpportunityOn 13 November, Jen-Hsun Huang and Masayoshi Son had an offline conversation in Japan, with a relaxed atmosphere, reviewing the latter's past investment in NVIDIA and discussing the development of AI in Japan. This article provides a summary of the past entanglements between the two, as well as the direction of the current stage of development.



At the 2020 Softbank World Congress, Masayoshi Son and Jen-Hsun Huang had a round-the-counter conversation on ‘What's Next for AI’. Jen-Hsun Huang, sitting by the fire in his trademark leather jacket, talked about the value of bringing Arm into the fold, and Masayoshi didn't mince his words, saying that the elder Huang would reach the level of Steve Jobs in the next 10 years.



Four years later, the 61-year-old Jen-Hsun Huang and the 67-year-old Masayoshi Son sat down together again, and the topic still revolves around AI, but their personal situation and their helms of Nvidia and SoftBank have changed. 4 years of vicissitudes, Nvidia's plan to buy Arm at a huge cost has been aborted, but it has become one of the highest flyers on the wind of AI. On the contrary, Masayoshi Son, after putting his main efforts into Arm, experienced a trough, and finally ushered in a reversal in 2023 with the east wind of AI, and the success of Arm's IPO greatly alleviated the pressure on Softbank's revenue.



On a different path, whether it's Jen-Hsun Huang or ambitious Masayoshi Son, they are all betting on AI, Nvidia is known as the ‘arms dealer in the AI era’, and all of them, from big companies to unicorns, rely on their high-performance GPUs to guarantee their arithmetic power; Arm announced in July this year that it has formally entered into the field of AI chips, and it plans to realise mass production in the autumn of next year.



So it was no surprise that AI was the theme of the dialogue, which began with a ‘brag’ from Jen-Hsun Huang, who praised Masayoshi Son as ‘the only entrepreneur and innovator in the world who chooses and partners with the winners in every generation of technological change’. They then focused on AI development in Japan.",11-13-2024

"NVDA: Why the stock is still massively undervalued? NVDA stock closed at 148.31$ on 12th November, 2024.

With the influx of AI chips is all electronic and home appliances, demand for NVDA latest offerings are going to stay strong till the end of this decade.

Some of the applications of AI chips:

LLM Training Models
Data Centers
Cloud Computing
Enterprise computer systems
Home computers
Cars (latest EV and IC models)
Smart phones
Home appliances (televisions, refrigerator, washing machine, micro wave, oven-toaster-griller etc)
Home security systems & door locks
Home bots 
Industrial robots
Medicine and industry
Aircrafts and in airlines operations
Shipping
Minning
Inventory Management Tools
Police and Homeland Security
Cameras (Digital hand held, security camera etc)
Digital Wear (smart watches, smart glass etc)
Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality/Metaverse

The AI chip market is likely to explode from some 130 B$ market in 2025 to 500 B$ by end of 2029. 

Some research publications are pegging the AI chip market size estimate at 300 B$ by 2029, which in my opinion is too small considering the ever widening adoption of AI chip embedded products within industries, corporations, and households.

If AI chip market reaches 500 B$ by 2029 then this will mark a 3.85X increase in the size of the pie, with major chunk [baring any breakthrough by a competition] falling in the laps on Nvidia.

Charitably, let us say that NVDA is able to corner only 60% of the market in 2029 [from current 90%], that would mean annual revenue of 300 B$.

Say profit margins drop from current 60% to only 40% by 2029, this translates to 120B$ in annual profits.

Based on a reasonable P/E ratio of 40 [current is 69], the stock price by 2029 should be at staggering 343$ per share.

"My views on why NVDA beats earnings and flies to higher supports. Likley past 200. For the PE bitchers and moaners, I leave you this:

AMD Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 126  

NVDA Trailing Twelve Month ACTUAL PE is: 69 


Chanos bitched and moaned all the way to the broke house where he had to close shop. Tesla preaching and evangelizing the PE did him an apostate. He's done. TESLA CRUSHED HIM. Tesla easily slid into it's PE and Chanos is no more. Same thing happened with the bitchers and moaners with Amazon, Google, etc. When a company is a quality company and especially part of the SP500, where every iteration of that index HAS TO PURCHASE this stock, you ride well, and the company easily slides well into it's PE very well and snuggly like. 

Just like Zuckerberg sucker punched Open AI LLM's by making it's LLM open source and scorching the Earth, So goes NVDA: Open sourcing their DATA CENTER TECH, ( a little secret, its not just about the GPU, it's the entire package, it's not just about BLACKWELL GPU. But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :

This OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.

( Jensen is busy busy busy )  
""At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.""  
..""said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.”

Everybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\*\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.

Crazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info=

""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs. The company is right, as a decent discrete GeForce RTX GPU can blow away any NPU inside of any CPU now, and for years to come.""

""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors.""

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter.

"IonQ - The Hyperbolic Run Just StartedLadies and Gentlemen, let me explain to you why IONQ, though up 84%YTD, is about to start an explosive bull run.

**What is IonQ?** Backed by Industry Veterans from companies such as NVIDIA, Amazon, Dell, Microsoft: IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company, developing a general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and software to generate, optimize, and execute quantum circuits.  Quantum computers will not take over traditional computers, but rather will exist alongside them.  For certain computational tasks, you currently need 2,500,000,000 GPUs worth of energy to solve what ONE Quantum Computer will be able to do near-term, an unbelievable saving in energy.  Explaining Quantum Computing as a whole would take several paragraphs, I encourage you to watch this beginner video if interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA) 

Quantum computers have just recently become more powerful than the worlds largest supercomputers for certain problems.

**Energy** \- With the rise in AI energy usage, we’re expected to double our energy consumption demands over the next few years.  Everyone seems to think building up a ton of nuclear reactors and power plants will be the solution to this new energy issue, but the CEO of IonQ disagrees.  He believes Quantum Computing can help AI drastically reduce its energy necessity. 

**AQ64, The Catalysts of all Catalysts** \- A task ran with AQ64 will use 18 Kilowatts of power, comparatively to **multiple billions** of kilowatts for an equivalent task on a GPU.   IonQ says reaching AQ64 will be a “ChatGPT” moment for Quantum Computing, equating to the recent AI boom of just a few years ago.  AQ64 is expected to release towards the end of 2025, but they have consistently CRUSHED target dates, beating their 2022 target date in 2022 by 2 months, 2023 by 7 months, and 2024 by 12 months.  AQ64 is coming sooner than we think.

**UAE x Quantum**: XPANSE QUANTUM is an exclusive forum taking place Nov 20-22 in Abu Dhabi, focusing on cultivating strategic relationships with 2,500 key global leaders in the UAE, and the GCC region.  Obviously they have a ton of money, and with the USA and China recently pouring billions into a new “Quantum Race”, it’s in their best interest to get involved.

**Elise Stefanik, UN 2025 and the “year of quantum”** \- Elise Stefanik was recently, as of 8 hours ago, appointed as UN Ambassador by Donald Trump.  Stefanik has close ties with IonQ [https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524) , and is a strong believer in the US beating China in the “Quantum Race”  Currently, the USA has only issued 1.2 Billion$ to be invested in Quantum over the next 5 years, while China has invested 15 Billion$.  So far, IonQ has received just 54.5M$ from the United States Air Force Research Lab… but that’s about to change…

The United Nations has proclaimed 2025 as the International “Year of Quantum Science and Technology”.  Elise Stefanik is the new UN Ambassador, wants to beat China in the “Quantum Race”, and the entire globe is about to accelerate Quantum development… Get it yet?

The last topic I will mention is Blockchain and Encryption being at threat due to Quantum Computing:  I don’t know enough of this, so I’ll quote one line and leave a link: “Quantum computers could potentially break current blockchain encryption, risking billions in cryptocurrency assets, according to a quantum policy expert.” [https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/)

**Why not other quantum companies?** Compared to other companies Algorithmic Qubits (AQ), IonQ has achieved near to ideal fidelity, AKA, their methods actually work, whereas other companies fail.  On top of this, IONQ has recently begun a spree of not only partnering with, but also acquiring multiple companies in a strategic play to make themselves a defining leader in this emerging sector. 

First came the CPU, then the GPU, next up: the QPU.  So far Quantum Computing has found Value in potential Market Sizes of up to $220 Billion USD, expecting to be in the Trillions in a few years.  None of this is financial advice, and do your own research.

AI Giants Poised for Unprecedented Growth: Palantir and NVIDIA Set to Soar 2025, As education systems worldwide grapple with fundingfrom the article - However, the implications of AI extend far beyond corporate growth. As education systems worldwide grapple with funding challenges, AI emerges as a powerful tool to bridge gaps and enhance learning experiences. AI-driven educational tools, such as virtual tutoring and adaptive learning platforms, can help mitigate the effects of under funding by providing personalized assistance and adjusting to individual learning styles.

Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.

I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.

All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.

* Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them.
* Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs.
* Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption.
* IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&utm_content=webinar&utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.

# Revenue Growth and Business Progress

After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.

https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55

This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.

Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.

Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.

Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.

With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.

# Business Applications

I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.

This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.

Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.

It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.

The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.

# Options Chain

I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.

# Institutional and Government Interest

In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.

Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.

# Competitors

For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.

IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.

# Bear Thesis

The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.

Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.

But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?

I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.

# Founders

I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.

It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.

# Conclusion

That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",11-06-2024

In the current secondary market, chips are no longer the most favored AI investment target. Instead, the spotlight has shifted to AI applications. The U.S. stock market's ""AI+"" trend is producing an increasing number of standout performers.

Recently, AI application stock $**Applovin (APP.US)** reached a new all-time high, with its stock price surging over 850% year-to-date and a market cap exceeding $100 billion, continuing to fuel the AI narrative. Meanwhile, **Palantir (PLTR.US)**, known for its ""AI+Defense"" focus, has also risen an impressive 318% this year.

According to Menlovc data, overall enterprise AI spending has grown from $2.3 billion last year to $13.8 billion this year. While foundational models remain the largest area of expenditure, spending on model deployment and application layers is accelerating at a faster pace.

Namely, Nvidia.  I was the biggest nvidia fan boy.  I was fully committed, put in a significant amount into the stock; nearly all prudent investors would have disapproval of.  But I believed it would hit big.  This was when it was first hovering over $950($95).

Days later it dropped big and it scared me shitless.  I had to wait months for it to finally get back to break even, and the moment it did, I got out.  It felt great getting my money back.  Then, of course, it kept trending up.  I never got back in.

Then that flash crash happened.  I had a feeling that crash would happen, and told myself that when it did, I would get back in.  It happened, and I was worried it would crash more, never got in.  I convinced myself I would be better off using the money to buy a house.

"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global MarketsEdit: People are misunderstanding the question. I’m not bearish on tech. It’s more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech’s strong performance fades (maybe it doesn’t, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech—especially the “Magnificent 7”—and compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching “international” here if you haven’t already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the “Magnificent 7” (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I’m particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets—both developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I’m asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I’ve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I’m also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see, excluding tech from the equation, international equities don’t appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So, I’m interested in seeing if global diversification, especially in emerging markets, would still yield solid returns after this adjustment.

A few questions I have:
Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500’s performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

"Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",12-16-2024
"$AVGO Analysis [DD]  ----Broadcom(AVGO)

This ticker is surfing multiple growth waves, including the AI boom, 5G rollout, and enterprise software takeover. My research reflects a top-tier supplier of custom chips powering cloud titans like AWS and Google Cloud, and its recent $61 billion VMware acquisition just opened a fat new cash spigot with juicy profit margins. With AI and 5G still in the early innings, Broadcoms got a serious baller vibe rn.

Financially, Broadcom is a cash cow. Were talking monster gross margins at 75% and a cash-printing machine generating around $16 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Dividends are popping off, up 24% annually over five years, and the current yield at 2.3% isnt too shabby for a growth beast.

On valuation, this stock looks like a steal. Trading at \~20x forward earnings, its way cheaper than high-flyers like NVIDIA, despite packing serious growth potential. Analysts are eyeing the $1,000+ zone for the stock in the next few years, which spells a tasty upside from here.

The risks? Regulatory heat and a macro slowdown could throw some shade, but Broadcoms diversified playbook spreads the risk nicely.

TL;DR: Broadcom is a money-printing machine crushing it in semis and software. With AI, 5G, and VMware in its corner, this one’s a no-brainer. Slap a $950 short-term target on it, and long-term, its got legs to hit $1,200+.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",12-16-2024

"Question on whether I should take some profit on Nvidia and reinvest.For context, I am 25 years old and from the UK. 

I bought 5 shares of Nvidia in late May 2020. 
Fast forward to today and they have obviously risen considerably and I have seen multiple stocks splits. 

I have been investing in SP500 and other stocks in the meantime too, and would say that my stake in NVDA now accounts for about 38% of my portfolio.

My question is whether I should reduce my position, take out the profits and put them back into an ETF?

Alternatively, I’m thinking that  I’m young and can take the risk to see a potential greater upside over the next 5-10 years?


What would your advice be? Many thanks in advance.",12-13-2024
"NVDA Fundamental Analysis w/ ChartsThere is no shortage of dollars or bullshit when it comes to NVDA, the world's AI GPU hero of heroes. And with NVDA's revenue and profits not just increasing but multiplying in such a short timespan, investors want to know is it still a good time to buy, to catch the AI wave, as it builds and crashes upon the world, both that of capital investment and the greater world at large. 

Revenue and profits multiplying:
https://imgur.com/oOetNo4
https://imgur.com/caOkRlh

And here’s the chart that shows the impact of ChatGPT on the share price and earnings:

https://imgur.com/SxhIF9z

The top line is the price investors are paying. 

The bottom line is what those investors are getting, so to speak (NVDA’s net income over the previous year (trailing twelve months)) 

The vertical line roughly represents ChatGPT hitting 100m users with the line at 2023 January 1st and ChatGPT reportedely hitting 100m users sometime in that month of January according to Reuters and The Guardian.

Reuters:

The firm will present you with the basic facts about NVDA, not as, and never as, a financial recommendation, but as an introduction to its financials, to give you a better idea if it's even worth your time to further explore NVDA as a company and potential vehicle of investment. The firm does not want you to be falsely misled into thinking we can offer you expertise on NVDA, we cannot. We can however answer the questions that we would expect any man who'd risk his capital to answer. How much money does NVDA make? How much do they have? And you would think, most importantly, how much has NVDA paid their previous investors so far? And while we don't believe the answers to these questions to justify investment, this firm adamantly believes that not knowing the answers to these questions is unacceptable for those who do or would choose to buy common stock in NVDA. 

In short, you'd have to be a fucking idiot to lend your money to a company without reading our charts and commentary, or the equivalent there of. To assess the full risk of NVDA however, will require a much deeper dive than a single blog post can provide.

Let’s take a look at what investors were thinking during the ChatGPT hype and whether that investment panned out at a fundamental rather than speculative level. In other words, did NVDA actually make more money or did its share price just go up?

https://imgur.com/wRnNWlD

This graph shows what percentage of NVDA’s share price was being represented by the money it had made (ttm net income/shares/share price). This 10 year low during 2023, shows unequivically that there was in fact investment hype during this time, that the price per earnings went very high as people were willing to accept less than 1% earnings just to get in on the hype. Why would investors accept such low earnings per dollar? Because these investors anticipated that the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and the AI hype around it, would mean a growth for NVDA that would more than make up for the price they paid. So were they dumb? Did they overpay? Let’s find out! 

For our example, we’ll imagine an investor that bought sometime in February after the 100m user threshold was announced:

February 15th, 2023
  $22.75 price
  $0.175 net income
  $0.175/$22.75 = ~0.8% 


December 10th, 2024
  ~$2.57 net income
  $2.57/$22.17 = ~11% 


If an investor had bought sometime in February after the news of the 100m users was released. Let’s say for example February 15th at a closing price of approximately $22.75 per share they would have bought when NVDA’s trailing twelve month net income was about $0.175 (17.5 cents) per share, or about 0.8% of the price of the share at that time. Today, those same shares carry about $2.57 per share, a wopping 10x increase (almost 15 actually) in just 2 years. $2.57/$22.75 = ~11%, which means investors that bought in on the AI hype are already seeing the net income of their shares exceed the growth rate of the money supply (M2), which is about 7-8%. Meaning that NVDA isn’t just earning more dollars, its earning a greater share of the economic pie, and in a world where profits are actually returned to investors, would mean beating inflation (at least from a micro perspective). Now whether this cash that NVDA is reporting to generate will ever actually make it back to the shareholder is another story.

Now that we’ve seen that buying (even when the fundamental value of the shares was at its lowest) has paid off, let’s take a look at how much money NVDA actually has:

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

As you can see, NVDA has almost no money relative to its price. The market’s pricing of NVDA is derived principally from the money it is supposed to make in the future, rather than the present value of the company.

This is not what the firm would deem a good fundamental investment. Why? Because one would be paying a future price for future value, rather than the current price for its current value. Furthermore, the market is a game of desperation, and if shareholders are desperate for money, they should be offering their shares below the liquidation value of the company. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush after all. 

However, if one understands that NVDA’s price has been based on the growth of its earnings, and if one can also see that the growth of said earnings has gone up, but its stock price has gone down (as is the case for NVDA at the time of this post ~$135) then one could speculate that the market will not only price NVDA’s earnings higher than they are currently being priced, but that the market will actually price its earnings higher than in the previous quarters unless the market believes that NVDA’s future growth will be lower. The firm believes that within the next 3 months, NVDA will almost certainly attain new all time highs. In fact, we believe the passive participant in the market, will be genuinely surprised by how high the price of NVDA will go. At the time of this post, the firm has no positions in NVDA. An associate of the firm has exposure to NVDA through long options on the SNP500. A position the firm feels is not worth mentioning as longing the SNP500 might as well be a long on inflation.

So NVDA has made all this money? How much of that money has been returned to shareholders? 
https://imgur.com/RANJVwo

As you can see by that line at the bottom, almost none. About half of the money has been spent on share buybacks and when the company’s evaluation is 50x the money that it makes and 50x the money that it has, these buybacks only break even once the company has actually grown 50x (less so if you’re only evaluating the company on past earnings and not the amount of money it actually has, in this case, you might only want a 5x to consider yourself breaking even) . I’d much rather have my money now and use it to make more money, than wait around for NVDA to 50x. But NVDA doesnt give shareholders the option of how to spend their own money or how to evaluate the company. They don’t give the money to the shareholder to decide whether they want to wait for a 50x gain on NVDA. They’ve decided they’ll spend it for you. Not on growing the company or acquiring others, but by buying their own stock. 

Now that we can understand a basic view of NVDA’s finances and how it relates to its price, let’s take a glance at some of the more sinister aspects of NVDA.

First is this little tidbit the firm discovered while reading NVDA’s Q2 filing:
https://imgur.com/b438cbJ

NVDA expects you to follow **ALL**  6 of its listed social media accounts and will be leaving out material information in its 10Q and 10k filings that will only be available in its listed social media accounts. This is clearly unethical, and our firm at this time questions whether this intent to distribute exclusive material information across 6 different channels is even legal. Though we do not have the legal training or background to make a claim one way or the other, we would like to assume that the system in place would not allow such a thing.

Now lets throw a bone to the hardware guys. If you’ve never heard of Moore’s Law, you can skip this section as trying to understand what Moore’s Law means will get in the way of seeing the blatant contradiction between NVDA’s CEO and his company’s own SEC filings. For your time:

   Moore's Law is the observation that the  number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.

   The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel

   From Wikipedia: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law


So why is the firm bringing up Moore’s Law? We don’t even know what half that sentence means, and we certainly wouldnt be able to explain the nuances of NVDA’s hardware products. Well, there’s one thing we do know, it’s how to bullshit. So let’s wind back the clocks to the end of 2022. September. Right before entering Q4.

“Moore’s Law’s dead,” Huang said, “And the ability for Moore’s Law to deliver twice the performance at the same cost, or at the same performance, half the cost, every year and a half, is over. It’s completely over, and so the idea that a chip is going to go down in cost over time, unfortunately, is a story of the past.”

Source: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moores-laws-dead-nvidia-ceo-jensen-says-in-justifying-gaming-card-price-hike-11663798618



Ok, so going into Q4, Moore’s Law is dead. The CEO said it’s over baby. Rapid growth is a thing of the past. That means the market should be lowering its growth expectations for NVDA right?

https://imgur.com/VSPPMhj
https://imgur.com/6KPxWte

But it did the opposite. Investors were willing to pay more for less, implying they actually expected NVDA’s long term growth rate to increase not decrease. Almost as if the market knew what NVDA would end up publishing in its Q4 filing:

Source: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581023000017/nvda-20230129.htm

(10k filed Feb 24, 2023)

So not only did the company contradict the CEO’s statements made in the September prior to the reported quarter, now theyre actually ahead of Moore’s law, and according to them, giving the entire industry a path forward. What the fuck. 🤣

And to finish things off, we’ll put on our tin foil hats. The firm does not know how to verify the veracity of the following information. 

There has been a short report put out by Hindenburg Research regarding SMCI:

    https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/



The firm has no idea if the information reported is true. So this last section is just for fun. If the information in the report is true, then the firm would conclude that it paints the picture that SMCI has been funneling money out of the company into other companies, out of shareholder hands, into the hands of insiders and their network of family and friends. SMCI’s biggest customer? NVDA. In other words, if the allegations are accurate, the biggest chunk of money that SMCI funneled out came from NVDA. So it’s really not outside the realm of possibility that NVDA was intentionally buying from SMCI knowing where the money was ending up. The firm is not in the practice of lawsuits or building criminal cases. So the firm cannot and has no intention of doing so here for you now. The firm, however, is also not stupid. And the fact that all this money the company is making is not ending up in shareholders pockets, really isnt helping the “management would never steal from shareholders” fantasy that many would like to be the truism that must be disproved with mountains of evidence. It should have to be proven that the money is being returned to investors, not the other way around. When the vast majority of the profits dont go to the investors, which we can see from the dividend chart, but get spent on buybacks at 50x multiples, well people start to listen when accusations start to be made about money being funneled into other companies.

We’ve learned a lot. We’ve seen the impressive growth of NVDA’s earnings and how they relate to its price and the general hype around AI. We’ve shown that the company has barely any money at all and is being priced on future earnings. We’ve shown where some of this money is going. And we even got to put on our conspiracy hats for a little bit. 

And that is our fundamental analysis of NVDA, the AI giant. The good, the bad, and the fugly. Thanks for tuning in.

"Unpopular opinion: I'm bullish on $GOOGHear me out:

1. **It’s the only cloud not dependent on Nvidia**: Google Cloud has carved out **11%** of the global cloud market, a significant jump from **6%** just a few years ago. In 2023, they generated about **$33.1 billion** in revenue, showing impressive growth and potential. 
2. **Leader in quantum computing**: Google's ""Willow"" chip might be a quantum leap. It can tackle problems in minutes that would take even supercomputers **10 septillion** (what the heck is the number?) **years** to solve. 
3. **Search Domination:** Google still holds over **90%** of the search engine market share worldwide. Every day, billions turn to Google first, last, and always. Perplexity? Not even close. Google's still the king, and the throne isn't going anywhere. 
4. **Top streaming platform**: YouTube has over **2.5 billion** monthly active users, making it the largest streaming service out there. With $29 billion in ad revenue in 2023, they're not just streaming—they're literally printing money. 
5. **Only operational robo-taxi business**: Waymo, a part of Alphabet, is leading the charge in self-driving technology. They’ve completed over **20 million miles** of autonomous driving on public roads, putting them ahead of Tesla and others. 
6. **Browser war winner:** Google Chrome has nearly **65%** of the web browser market share, making it the most popular choice globally. Its smooth integration with other Google services keeps users coming back for more.

"Portfolio allocation talkHello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

Thanks all.",12-08-2024
"What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**

**Individual stocks 25%**

\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

"Talking with my dad about Nvidia over ThanksgivingMy dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

"Advice needed. Should I pull off the market temporarily?I’m 38, living in the U.S., and looking for some guidance on my Roth IRA investments. This account is primarily for my daughter’s future education and my retirement (I also have a pension to fall back on). I’m still working and ham 22 years from retirement.

Currently, I have about $13k invested in this account. Most of it is in FGBRX (a blue-chip fund), with smaller positions in NVidia and AMD.

The market has been performing well, but I’m nervous about a potential downturn, especially if Trump re-enters office. Tariffs seem to be back on the table, and from everything I’ve read and watched, they seem like a bad idea economically. I’m worried a market crash could be looming.

I know the conventional wisdom says to stick it out and let the market ebb and flow over the long term. But I’m considering pulling out of the market temporarily—just for a few months—to see how things play out.

I’d really appreciate some advice. Am I overthinking this? Should I just stay the course, or does it make sense to go to cash for a bit given the uncertainty?",11-28-2024

"$Dell Earnings Down 11%..I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

These are some companies I’m thinking so far, I appreciate any insight or suggestions for other sectors/stocks 

-Tesla and other Battery/mining related companies Tesla uses?
-UFC/Endeavor/WWE/ZUFA (Dana white companies) (don’t remember the exact parent company ticker)

-US Oil / Fracking companies?

"MPWR should be in your portfolio, TODAY!Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has been a powerhouse in the semiconductor space for years, bringing top-tier power solutions across hot sectors like cloud, telecom, automotive, industrial, and consumer tech. Established back in ‘97 out of Kirkland, WA, MPWR has built a solid rep as a go-to for high-performance power components.

**Recent Stock Action**

In October, MPWR traded in the $950 price range and as of November 12, 2024, MPWR is trading at $638.26, taking a hit of about 13.98% from the previous close. It saw an intraday high of $689.00 and bottomed out at $610.00. Price action lately has been choppy, but analysts are still very much on board with this stock.

**Analyst Ratings and Price Targets**

Despite the pullback, the Street remains bullish on MPWR. Here’s the rundown:

* **Truist Financial**: Analyst William Stein kept his ""Buy"" rating on October 31, boosting his target from $918 to $994.
* **Stifel Nicolaus**: Back on October 9, Stifel held the ""Buy"" call and upped the target to $1,100.
* **TD Cowen**: Matt Ramsay reiterated a ""Buy"" rating on October 31, tagging it with a $975 target.
* **Rosenblatt Securities**: Also bullish, reissuing a ""Buy"" on October 29 with an $880 target.
* **Needham & Company**: On November 11, Quinn Bolton reaffirmed his ""Buy"" rating with a $950 target.

With an average price target around $942.40, that’s roughly a 23% upside from here. MPWR is a consensus ""Strong Buy.""

**Latest Developments**

The stock took a 15% dive on November 11 after rumors hinted at MPWR losing some Nvidia business. Management fired back, denying any issues with Nvidia, and the analysts stepped in to support the stock. It’s a shake-up, but nothing management isn’t handling.

**The Bottom Line**

MPWR is still a major player with a strategic foothold in high-growth sectors. Despite the recent noise, analysts are holding steady on their bullish stance. For long-term growth in semis, MPWR has the fundamentals to keep driving forward.",11-12-2024

"Creating a Python library for Mandelbrot's metrics, doubts with Hurst Exponent/ScaleSorry if I am off-topic, I am new to this world and to get feedback I had to start somewhere (send me to the proper subreddit if I'm wrong).

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

"NVDA To Join Dow Jones Industrial Average

Nvidia is replacing rival chipmaker Intel

The switch will take place on Nov. 8. Also, Sherwin Williams will replace Dow Inc
in the index, S&P Dow Jones said in a statement.

Nvidia shares have climbed over 170% so far in 2024 after jumping roughly 240% last year, as investors have rushed to get a piece of the AI chipmaker. Nvidia’s market cap has swelled to $3.3 trillion, second only to Apple.

"What are the best resources for research?I'm a few years into investing, and I've mainly invested in ETFs the entire time. I've made money, but would also like to start researching individual stocks. This is usually discouraged, but I would research stocks in industries I know, like tech, web, and pharma. For example, I made almost as much with my 10% of individual stocks as I did with all 90% of my ETFs. I know I got a bit lucky buying into NVDA relatively early, but I've built my own computers for two decades and always considered them a solid company. However, I didn't predict the need for Nvidia cards during the AI boom. 

More recently, I have been watching RDDT since its IPO. When it sank to 40.00 shortly after the IPO, I felt it was undervalued and a bargain at that price. One significant predictor for me was that most of my google searches would autocomplete with “reddit” on the end of it. Those were my two huge winners out of nine stocks total.

TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

2) Stock vs Sp500

So when a business reach there expected earnings for the year does that mean that they beat the Sp500 or match it?

Like is the only way they will underperformed the Sp500 is if they underperform?

3) Should I care about Stock share prices?

Like I'm confused on why Costco ($800) and ulta beauty ($400) cost so much while apple, Nvidia, Google and Amazon are like $200 to $150

Like those 4 overall makes more money than Ulta & Costo so why are they less?

Is it because they are younger?

Also should I care about a stock share costing so much. To be honest Costco is a great business but since there share is so much it kind of scares me to invest in it.

4) So since I'm taking a 1% Risk would it be the best idea to do the risk on my Roth Ira & HSA since it is a tax advantage account?

"Investment strategy for my 401kI'm looking to roll my 401k into index funds, it was previously sitting in a low-yield bond; which is my fault, I didn't pay attention.

now I'm looking to invest it better, I'm looking CHAT, VTSAX, VTI, VGT, VOO, intel, nvidia, XLY and LQD. so i'm looking for a general idea on what I should look at more closely. I have a six figure sum lookin to invest for the next 20 years. I was checking out CHAT, NVIDA, SMH mostly for the AI boom.

Any advice or insight would be appreciated. I understand no one is a financial advisor and I hold no one responsible.

"Is it a good time to do DCAWhen stocks plummet it feels like you can start doing DCA to prevent emotional investing. I'm more concerned about chip stocks, September got off to a rough start for chip stocks, with $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ tumbling nearly 10%, the $PHLX Semiconductor Index (.SOX.US)$ slumping 8%, and shares of $Micron Technology (MU.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ declining by more than 5%, etc. But I didn't have a DCA investment plan before, investing in ETFs containing shares of these stocks looks safer...ETF recommendation?

"Chip/AI supplier recommendationsNovice investor. Have $1500 to play with at high risk. The whole chip and AI boom has me thinking about looking for publicly traded suppliers to those manufacturers/digital companies. Not Nvidia-like companies, but the step before.

"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing CompanyDoes anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment?

Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow.

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

Any thoughts on TSM as an investment?",09-03-2024

"Nvidia’s massive stock buybackFrom MarketWatch. 

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell

> The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That’s double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago

> Looking beyond the year, Nvidia’s announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia’s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.

I tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you’re spiraling down in the dumpster, there’s really no need to buy back— especially if you believe this is the High Point and it’s only going down from here.

Nvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow

But as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it’s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.

It’s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It’s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn’t destroy competition. 

So they’ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.

However, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It’s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that’s good news for them because they’ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.

So in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  

OR they feel they aren’t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.

Either way it’s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there’s so much money and the scale is so vast that it’s hard to wrap my head around. 

If they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it’s astounding how much money they would’ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.

Obviously, companies of this size don’t move that fast and they aren’t playing a shell game. So it’s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would’ve created out of a blip.

Lots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I’m having a tough time seeing through it. 

In the past, they haven’t been a really savvy financial company. They’re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They’ve just been “boring” R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. 

The stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn’t fit who they’ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they’re 3000 or 100? I suppose it’s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn’t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don’t really see the point.

As I’ve said, there’s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.

I like to think it’s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.

That’s my hope anyways.

Question about index fund vs nvidia Right now I have 7k in a Roth IRA and it’s all in fxaix. I’ve been seeings lots of stuff about nvidia eventually becoming a new apple type company that will be way higher than where it is now. Is it worth taking the risk and buying it with 3k now? I’m worried about missing an opportunity to get a company like this cheaper and getting a great head start in investing.,08-29-2024
"Poke holes in my theory pleaseSo to make numbers lets say I use $100. I can buy fractional shares and I buy nvidia for $100. I see a 5% gain over whatever period of time, and I sell. I take half the profit and save it for taxes, and the other half I feed into a SWPPX. That initial $100 dollars gets reinvested into something new. Always hold till a gain or if I am spooked a break even at the very least. 

Am I planning on making a living doing this? No. Do I want to? Not at the moment, maybe in the future when I have excess capital and a very stable and broad financial base. 

Whats wrong with this? Alot of friends tell me its pointless, its only gonna bite me in the ass in the end, and so on. I have done it a few times and it seems to work alright. 

It might be a bit of time waster, but I dont commit more than 15 minutes to it a day. I just buy low and sell high.

"So disappointed in the current state of AI after working with it for several yearsWe all read the headlines ""AI is coming to take over"", ""new LLM with massive performance gain"", ""something something AI"". Now let's try to apply AI to real world scenarios that provide actual value for companies (to justify the insane valuation of selling golden shovels - yes I am looking at NVIDIA which I miss when it was just a company building gaming GPUs when I was a kid in the early 00's), here are two examples from personal experiences:

* Customer A wants to build a system that replaces humans on the production line for QA. Customer A feeds images to Florence-2, visual GPT or any other pretrained generative AI model. Since the data is so sparse (it has not been trained on defects of a niche production line), the output is just complete garbage ""there's a spider crawling across a web in the middle of the image"" was seriously one of the outputs when asking one model to find dents on a metal surface (super visible obvious dent, even a monkey could be trained to detect it). Then you may ask, but why not train a custom object detection model?  Well surprise surprise, the defect rate is 0.001% so it will take 10 years for the customer to collect enough data to fine tune a model and by that point the production item is obsolete and replaced by a new one, also gen AI can't generate realistic images because, like before - the data does not exist (chicken and egg problem). 
* Customer B wants to use an LLM to sanitise code from memory leaks and overflow attacks before it gets pushed into production code. Unfortunately the LLM has been trained on global GitHub data which guess what, contains a bunch of crap code full of memory leaks written by humans (again, shit in - shit out). I've also struggled using copilot or GPT for anything more advanced than really trivial stuff, it also struggles writing test cases, it understands the ""general logic"" of the code however it messes up the details completely.

So why do I post this crap here? Well, there's this general over belief in AI which scares me as I am quite exposed to these companies from an investment standpoint (I've made a shit ton of money out of it, but it just doesn't feel right at the end of the day). Most of the over belief comes from senior positions that have very little insight in how the algorithms actually work and I feel like all the top 10 companies on the S&P are just circlejerking and propping up their valuations without providing any real value rather than a biased glorified search engine. How can I hedge against this AI bullshit when I am forced to buy these companies as part of my global diversification strategy? ",08-25-2024

"16 years old, looking for help!Hello guys,

I'm from Germany, and we start something like an apprenticeship for 3 years at the age of 16. You work 40h a week though you alternate between work and a school meant to combine theory and practice and prepare you for an actual job in the field you did the apprenticeship in.

My employer offers capital accumulation benefits of 40€/$44 a month. I've decided to put this,essentially,free money into an investment fund. As I am gonna be working in the banking industry,I don't gave to pay any additional fees to a investment fund including a stock depot,if that's the right word. I am using the UniGlobal offer.

Over the course of at least 6 years,these 40 euros go to the fund,which picks and buys stocks of different branches,something like ETFs. Right now, 70% of all stocks bought come from the IT branch, so from companies like Apple,Amazon,NVIDIA etc.

What stocks are bought are influenced by worldly events,so during the covid epidemic,mostly Medical and Pharmaceutical stocks were getting bought. 

After 6 years of paying in, I can freely access the depot and do whatever I want with the money. I can keep putting money in or sell everything off,though I will probably do the former.

My question is if you guys think that this is a good choice, as my only other 2 options were putting the money into a retirement account/fund or a savings contract. There is obviously risk involved but i am confident in it working out for the better. I ak still pretty young and would appreciate others' opinions on this.

"Investments in same industry as new employerHi all - I'm curious about thoughts on diversification away from the industry/sector of your employer.  Here is my dilemma:

1. Purchased shares in NVIDIA awhile back.  Current market value represents about 5% of my portfolio.  I'm bullish on the semiconductor industry over the relative long-haul and my intent was to hold long-term.  

2. Recently I've accepted a job in a company that supports the semiconductor industry.  Stock price seems to mirror the overall semiconductor industry as a whole.   As part of this job offer, I'll receive an initial RSU award with a 3 year vest with estimated total value of 15% of my current net worth with refreshers each year that should allow me to cash out at around 5% of my current net worth.  Stock price is fairly volatile but I see more upside than downside risk. 

3.  About 50% of my investment portfolio (retirement and brokerage) is tied to S&P500 index so I'm further exposed to NVIDIA there.  

I'm concerned about overexposure to the industry.

"Stock split vs trading priceThe recent nVidia split has me wondering if I understand the mechanics of how organized markets set prices around split events.  The split chronology, per nVidia's FAQ about it, is:

May 22 - 10:1 split announced

Thursday, June 6 - record date for entitlement to split

Friday, June 7 - distribution of split shares

Monday, June 10 - split shares start trading, at about 1/10 the price

Nasdaq's published closing prices around the split dates were:

6/5 - 1224.40

6/6 - 1209.98

6/7 - 1208.88

6/10 - 121.79

(BTW, not easy to find the actual pre-split prices on the internet.  EVERYBODY ""adjusts"" prices ASAP.)

\*\*\* BUT \*\*\*

With T+1 settlement, no buyer of nVidia on either the Thursday or the Friday of that week would have paid over $1200 for a share that would not be entitled to the split shares distributed after the close on Friday.

Did brokers show when-issued prices to their clients on the Thursday and Friday?  Adjust the quotes they showed?  Is there some standard, perhaps mandatory, mechanism for brokerage back offices to fix up the prices on all Thursday and Friday trades?

How did that work?",08-08-2024
"Is diversifiyng your portfolio wiht small ammounts worth it?I am 33, and started investing a couple of years ago. I cannot afford to invest much, I spend 250-300€ a month on my investments. As I started I just bought a bunch of ""stuff"" since I didn't understand much (not like I do now). So anyways, I recently started diversifying my portfolio, sold the penny stocks I saw online that might ""blow"" and was left with couple of etfs, Nvidia, AMD S&P500.  
So I decided to allocate that monthly budged into savings plan, and my broker allows it without any fees. I left majority of my money in Nvidia and S&P.

"Critique my logic - Making sense of the selloffHi all, I'd love to get some critique on my data points about this selloff to make sure I'm not missing anything.

For this event, the share market has dropped but there is up to $6.1t in money market funds (source: Financial Times (https://www.ft.com/content/ab2c5531-1b9b-42e4-b3b3-e6220d2595a8) which was on the sidelines before this. Jobs are in a good place, inflation is coming down - overall the data itself says the markets are pretty healthy. The sell off seems to be bullish investors heading for the doors to lock in profits, then others following to lock in profits and then others selling because they are freaking out. We see the VIX only started to go up on Thursday which was the day after nvidia's share price volatility, then explode over the last few days. If we look historically, the VIX in 2008 was going up in August before the penultimate in Oct.

So overall this tells me that this episode might be short lived. Given the high amount of cash on the sidelines BEFORE the markets started to tumble, and the Fed Reserve looking at a double interest rate cut of .5%, that'll drop saving account earning and force that money into the markets and now with share prices 'correcting' it might be a reasonable time to jump in

"Would you consider plowing money into single stocks prematurely?It was my goal to get $100k into the S&P 500 by age 30. I accomplished that task back in April, and now have been stacking cash ever since. I now have roughly 35% liquid cash uninvested which is a combination of my emergency fund, potential down payment for a property or land, and vacation money. 

I’m comfortable having the $60k in a HYSA right now, and my plan was after getting to the $100k invested, I would build my cash reserves closer to $100k, which is where I’m at now. After that I would go back to investing heavily, possibly starting with some single stocks since I have my great $100k base in the index. But seeing names like nvidia getting hammered right now, I’m tempted to throw another $10k or $20k into some single stocks now. 

I’m a bit of an emotional investor so it was hard for me to do $100k in the S&P. But I’m comfortable holding that for the long term no matter what.

"I (like many others) am bullish on NVIDIA and have a risky strategy in mind involving borrowing on margin and I would like to know if it all makes sense the way I’m picturing it in my head.Basically my plan is to fund a margin account with shares of VOO that I already own with Fidelity. 

After transferring the shares of VOO from Fidelity into an Interactive Brokers (IBKR) margin account, I then want to buy shares of NVDY (NOT NVDA) with margin. I chose IBKR because they had the lowest margin interest rate I could find; 7.8% compared with 12.125% that I’d get if I did this with Fidelity.

For those who may not be familiar with NVDY, it is a Yield Max fund that does not invest in Nvidia stock directly, but instead generates high yield income from a covered call strategy. The current dividend yield, based on the latest monthly dividend projected forward for 12 months, is 105% and their TTM dividend yield is 60%. [If you like, you can read more about NVDY and read the fund’s Prospectus here on the YieldMax website](https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/our-etfs/nvdy/)

With each dividend distribution received, I’d like to buy more shares of NVDY to decrease my average cost-basis, especially on the day where the stock price drops equal to the dividend distribution. This will allow me to own more shares and collect larger dividends as time goes by.

I am aware of the risk for NAV erosion, but given that I am long on NVIDIA and the stock price of NVDY seems to correlate with NVIDIA’s stock price, I actually think that as time passes and NVIDIA’s share price eventually increases over the coming several years, that the price of NVDY will remain relatively resilient. I don’t need it to go up, I just need it not to go substantially down, but I think it actually may go up as well. I do not believe this to be the case for other YieldMax funds however.

To give you an idea, I would like to buy 2000 shares of NVDY which is currently trading at $28.60 (which would be $57.2k in total). The most recent dividend distribution which was announced on July 3rd was $2.47 per share. Had I owned these stocks then, I’d have received $4940, on an investment that I purchased on margin and didn’t even have to have the money myself. This comes out to roughly 8.6% yield each month. Obviously there is no guarantee that you would get this amount each month and it probably won’t be the case, but I’d settle for an average of half of that amount on average over the next several months until the election and end of 2024. Regardless of how much it ends up being, it will almost certainly more than cover the 7.8% margin interest that I would be charged annually. 

I would then use all or some of the nearly $5k dividend to purchase more shares of NVDY. The stock price would decrease from whatever it is on the declaration date (let’s just assume it remains at $28.60; although I imagine that as we approach the declaration date that it will go up) by $2.47 and so I could therefore purchase up to 189 additional shares of NVDY at a presumed share price of $26.13.

In my opinion, it only makes sense to own shares of these super-high, income generating dividend yield ETFs when they are purchased on margin because the broker is the one paying the cost of the shares, but I am the one benefiting from what is essentially converting stock price growth into cash instead of value appreciation. The risk is of course that the stock price tanks, which I am willing to take as somebody very bullish on NVDA over the next 1-3 years.

My hope is that within one year, I will have collected enough dividend payments that I vastly out pace any depreciation in share price.

I know this strategy carries large amounts of risk, but I would like to take a stab at it. 

I basically just one question to ask about this strategy as I have done a lot of reading about margin accounts, but am relatively new to actually trading on margin, which I’ve avoided in the past, but I like the potential that it has with this strategy. You always gotta start somewhere haha.

1. I am a little fuzzy having never traded any dividend stock on a margin account before. Does the cash I receive for the dividend payout go towards paying down the outstanding margin loan balance, or is it deposited as cash? I suppose it does not really make too much of a difference in the long run because if my margin loan were to decrease, my buying power would increase and my maintenance margin amount would decrease and if I so choose, I could buy more NVDY shares on margin and all things are essentially equal one way or another. (I know this does not take into account how much loss of equity I may have once the stock price drops after the dividend distribution. Any actual purchases I make would involve a thorough evaluation of what the current maintenance margin, SMA and Reg-T are).

That’s basically my plan here. Again, I am well aware that it is risky, and as I am young-ish (early 30s), I am willing to take a big risk and see how it pans out. If I find that it’s not working as I envisioned, I’ll do what I always do and cut my losses, take an L, and try to make money elsewhere.

I would not describe myself as a novice investor as I have been actively managing my Fidelity account for the last five years and have been doing a lot of research and learning as much as I can, whether it is through reading or (unfortunately) trial and error. I do not have a background in finance however, and so some of the nuances and technical jargon when it comes to margin accounts and options trading can get tricky to parse through, so I appreciate the help of this community.

Do you guys see any glaring holes in this strategy? Aside from the fact that I am risking the stock price of NVDY decreasing?? If so, I’d love to hear it!

Thanks in advance!",07-16-2024
"1 Is there a process by which info about a stock goes from insider knowledge to widespread knowledge, and how that relates to bubbles?Warren Buffet once said something like 'be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy'

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors. However Tesla has had both dips and peaks since it lowered from its peak.",07-16-2024
"Two Arguments for Nvidia Stock Going DownI found this video, which essentially makes two points why Nvidia Stock is going to face challenges soon. 

1. Concern: Nvidia is building data centers for AI, but these data centers can not yet be used by companies to meet actual end-consumer demands which would be necessary in order to create actual revenue. The idea is that the ""customer (of those data centers) has no customer"". Thus, it has created a bubble, similar to a real estate bubble where many houses are being built without having people who are actually going to live in it.

2. Concern: the author of the video creates some criteria for companies or stocks that are in the danger of a downturn, such as decelerating revenue growth, decelerating earnings growth, margins going down and a high starting valuation, leading to multiple compression.

(Actual Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tRZmfmc8uc)

What do you think about these two arguments/concerns. Are they valid?

"My view on the language model value chain.Hi, I am a founder who is trying to build ""Google for Financial Research"" start out from equity research.

  
Today, I'd like to share my thoughts on how the past few years has been for AI, the current status, and finally the future. I do not know everything but wish to learn new things. So, I would love to get honest thoughts on my view --- and also my product if you're interested :)

  
### Value Chain



First, you can view the LM value chain similar to the computer value chain. 

- Foundation model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic are similar to semiconductor designers(fabless; e.g., Nvidia, Qualcomm). They design the models. Performance is everything.

- Cloud companies like Azure, AWS, and GCP are like semiconductor manufacturers(e.g., TSMC, Samsung Electronics). They provide training resources for actually making production-grade models. Cost and reliability is everything.

- Finally, newly born application companies or existing ones those who are harnessing this technology is like computer companies(e.g., Apple, Dell). They don't need to know what's under the hood, as it's abstracted. User experience is everything.

  
### Past

  
Yeah so, over the past few years. GPT. Boom! That's how it the world started to become interesting (and inflating). GPT-2 was sensational to tech guys. GPT-3 comes out, that becomes history. GPT-3.5? GPT-4. ... You get the point. 

  
OpenAI has been leading this industry ever since its emergence into the mass market. Although many competitors like Anthropic and Google has joined the league, and they also perform very well, it is OpenAI that is dominating its presence in the arena. I think Altman's plan is to make OpenAI's models to be the go-to-model for intelligent systems, and he is succeeding very well. Fyi, I am really not a big fan of Sam so don't judge me wrong.

  
### Present

  
Now, the present. As you all know, the only real winner in this market is right now Nvidia and PaaS companies. No doubt on this. All the companies building foundation models like GPT, Claude, or Mistral is falling apart. Either suffering from wrong operation(e.g., Stability) or poor financial health. The global surge of these new companies trying to construct a new tech infrastructure has only lead to those who provide 1) datasets, 2) GPU server instances, 3) actual GPUs, 4) and energy.

  
But in order for this waterfall to sustain, the foundation model providers need to actually generate profit to keep the cycle going. Unfortunately, infrastructures make money from people(or companies) trying to build applications. Well, applications ... Hmm ... As a founder who is actually building one, the truth is, the only two product that I've seen engineers applying to their systems is OpenAI's gpt-4o and Anthropic's Claude-3.5 Sonnet. Of course, there are open-source models that you can host by yourself, but that's just not essential for those who are trying to build AI applications. Even large software companies like Microsoft and Notion solely depend on gpt-4o.



So, the sad thing is that most of these FM providers will die either by financially perishing or getting acquired by larger infrastructures like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

  
### Future

  
I am really excited about this and have some thoughts on this. I will get back to you guys on this if you found this post to be interesting. In the mean time, feel free to ask me questions and let's discuss about... anything! Cheers.",07-12-2024
"QaaS - Trying to research funds to invest long termI’ve been trying, to no avail, to find a QaaS focused ETF.

"Why is short-term investing risky despite frequent stock price fluctuations?I'm a software engineer who is interested in long term investing either in crypto or stock market.

It is known that short-term investing is risky and requires time and effort, however my logic says otherwise.

I'm a beginner so I apologize in advance for my ignorance, but, could you point out to me the flaws in my thought process and identify the risky parts?

Let me provide an example with Nvidia stocks.

**Facts:**

1 Technology is rapidly growing, so Nvidia is likely to increase in value over the long term.

2 Throughout the day, Nvidia's stock price experiences minor fluctuations, including 1% increments.

**Basic idea:**

* Create a Stock bot programmed to sell stocks once price is incremented at least 1%. The following steps are executed automatically:

1. Bot invests 3000€ in Nvidia stock at the start of the day.
2. Bot waits for the stock price to increase by at least 1%.
3. After 2 hours, the price increases by 1%, and the bot sells the stocks, making a €30 profit.
4. The bot reinvests €3000 and waits for another 1% increase to sell again. Steps 1-3 are repeated indefinitely.

Assuming Fact #2 is true, the worst-case scenario is that the bot waits several days for the 1% increase, but it will eventually happen.

So, my question is: why not use the above approach to make short-term profits?",07-11-2024
"How far do you think we are in the AI stock market hype cycle?Early stages? Mid stages? Late stages?

Tech valuations are getting very rich, to their second-highest levels ever, even during the current 15+ year secular bull market (March 2009-present) marked by tech sector outperformance.

- Apple: $3.6 trillion, 36x earnings

- Microsoft: $3.5 trillion, 41x earnings

- NVIDIA: $3.3 trillion, 79x earnings

Right now, we’re still in a stage of the mania where simply saying “AI” is enough to make a stock rocket higher. Since unveiling Apple Intelligence on June 10, Apple stock has risen by 21% ($700 billion) on analyst predictions of an “upgrade supercycle.” Moderna stock shot up 60% higher in May after announcing a partnership with Open AI.

Eventually, this will give way to a “show me the money” phase in which investors need to see actual profits to sustain these valuations. But clearly we’re not there yet. For the companies selling shovels in the current gold rush (NVIDIA, TSMC, etc.) they’re generating spectacular earnings right now, but the question is how sustainable they’ll be for the longer term. Wall Street has their earnings growth priced in as being permanent.

Possible turning points:

Apple will release its AI-enhanced iPhone 16 this autumn. If sales are weak, it’ll be clear that consumers aren’t as jazzed up about AI as markets are predicting. But the last few years haven’t had any notable upgrades at all, so there could still be an upgrade cycle.

On the corporate side, it’s harder to predict. Corporations including financial services & other non-tech industries have been willing to pay Microsoft & Open AI hand over fist because it’s the latest hot technology; mentioning AI boosts their stock prices; and they’re always looking for ways to boost efficiency.

For Big Tech, there’s a widespread belief that this is a can’t-fail arms race, given the winner-takes-all nature of the industry. Therefore, it’s possible that even if consumers aren’t too hyped about AI, Big Tech corporations will gladly continue to pay NVIDIA billions every year. Especially since M&A has grinded to a halt due to regulatory scrutiny, they have to find something to do with all this money.

Central banks:

On top of all this, you have central banks around the world itching to ease and pump markets higher. Alan Greenspan’s 1995 rate cuts likely extended the life of the first Internet bubble by a few years. But at least he recognized it was a bubble and popped it in 2000 by raising rates, even as inflation was below-target & decelerating. Jerome Powell, who’s worth over $50 million and highly invested in stocks, has said he’d do no such thing, and only high inflation can lead to more rate hikes.

What are your thoughts? How high will the market & tech valuations go? Will this lead to a market crash or a new plateau?

"Advice on what to do with my Roth IRA and 403bI'm 23 and fresh out of college. I just secured a semi-permanent teaching job at a school district. I recently opened an IRA with Fidelity and I currently have about $300 in there planning on putting at least a few hundred a month in it. I talked to two people, my uncle and my gf's dad. My uncle told me to invest in some utilities like DUK or NEE and some in household goods. I believe after looking at market trends it would be a good idea to wait till Q4 of this year or Q1 of next year to buy. I was considering Duke Energy, Nvidia, RIOT, Nike, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, and Rivian as some stocks to buy. My gf's dad told me to not even consider stocks, and to mainly invest in itrustcapital and focus on short term gains via crypto. My uncle's plan seems more reasonable to me, but I am also interested in maybe putting 15-20 percent into crypto. Crypto seems alittle to volatile. I assume my 403b will already be put into some sort of mutual fund. What would you do if you were me? Where so I go to learn more, and what advice should I take from my uncle and my gf's dad?",07-08-2024
"Opinions/Suggestions About My Current AllocationI’m 42 and in great financial standing, but hoping to maximize my already-great returns to retire early.  I currently have 60% of my money invested in the market - vanguard - and 40% in a high yield capital one 360 savings account (4.5% return on the latter I believe). 

70% of my Vanguard money is in VTSAX, 25% in VTIAX and 5% in VGT.  I set the VTSAX and VTIAX up years ago on the advice of someone in this sub, and I added the VGT last year on the advice of a friend (thanks NVIDIA and my friend).  My vanguard YTD return percentage at the end of 2023 was 22%, which I thought was pretty great.  

I worry that I might not have enough real estate exposure because I don’t own any property. I will eventually inherit a valuable farm in Iowa because my father was a farmer, so I haven’t felt the need to get into real estate too heavily.  I might purchase an apartment in NYC, where I live, at some point in the next few years.  Part of me is convinced the markets will get walloped before 2030, so the idea would be to park my money in real estate before then.  

Curious to know what you all think.  Is the 70% VTSAX + 25% VTIAX allocation still advisable?   Any other suggestions?

I’m not quite at the $1m mark, but I will be within 2 years if current trends continue.",07-07-2024

"Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI EraWhenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",07-03-2024
"Diversify once you hit a gain % threshold?Hey everyone, I’m 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I’ve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it’s around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else.

"S&P 500 excluding Magnificent 7?I'm planning to fire my financial advisor that has been managing a lot of my wealth the last 5-6 years. They have taken a very ""safe"" approach to the portfolio, which means maybe 5% returns on average after their fees. It was nice during Covid as it didn't drop, but it's been way lower than the market & S&P500, especially with the gains in the last 12 months. Highly frustrating.

Anyway, I'd like to take it into my own hands and have been planning to move to VOO, but I think NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple are WAY overpriced and will crash in the next 12 months when the generative AI play doesn't show the expected impact with companies. I'm also exposed to tech directly with other parts of my portfolio.

So, I'm looking for a good way to get the benefits of the S&P500 but without the Magnificent 7. What's the best way to accomplish this? I've seen S&P500 equal rated ETFs, but I don't have problem with the S&P500 rating otherwise.

"Bond ETFs: Worth or not? Are you taking a shot at them?The closer we get to the expected lowering of interest rates, the more I'm looking into purchasing Bond UCITS ETFs ***(I live in the UK, meaning we can't buy the usual US ETFs like BND due to regulations)***. A lot of fund managers have mentioned that this is once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy bonds and I tend to agree. Obviously, they have some vested interest in it, but the bullish case is clear.

1. If interest rates drop, then bonds prices will go up as yield and price move in opposite directions. Therefore, if the Fed and the BOE lower interest rates as expected in August/September, the logical conclusion is for those Bond UCITS to go up in price. (We saw the ECB, Bank of Canada and the Swiss Bank lower rates, but I'm guessing these didn't have as much weight as the Fed or they were simply tentative/not convincing enough).
2. If interest rates do not drop, then at least you'll keep getting a relatively good (historically for the last 15 years) yield on your bonds, therefore making some decent passive income.

Obviously, interest rates can also go up, but I think by this point, the chances are pretty much non-existent for that scenario even though it was being mentioned a lot a few months ago.

Now, the next question here is:

1. Which Bond UCITS are the best to get? Ones like iShares Global Aggregate Bond Market (£AGGG) or something riskier like Emerging Markets Bonds (£SEMB)? Here, my expectation is that AGGG would be safer, but returns could be higher with the likes of SEMB.
2. What would the expected price gain be like? Would it be 5%/10%/20% bearing in mind that rates are NOT expected to go back down to 0.5% like before, but somewhere in the range of 2.5%-3%?
3. Is the opportunity cost of not going into equities worth it, e.g. would equities stand a better chance of a gain in the same scenario? Personally, it ***feels*** like the US market is on the edge of a precipice given the price movement so far this year of companies like Nvidia. I'm getting a bubbly feeling and it seems like bonds are now a much more attractive alternative than they were 6 months ago.

Schroders made an interesting article about that - [https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/](https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/) - and from the look of it, equities tend to outperform bonds in most scenarios UNLESS there is a recession in which case bond investors tend to do a bit better. However, most of the times we've seen rate cuts, there's also been a recession (again, check the Schroders article). I've also seen that cutting rates usually ends up being a bearish indicator for the stock market although, again, that probably depends on whether there's going to be a recession.

I personally haven't ventured into them yet. Looking at [the price of AGGG](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/291773/ishares-core-global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf), it looks like there's still a good buying opportunity. However, the fund's returns so far have not been stellar (worth pointing out that it was started in 2019 so the returns are only showing returns in near-zero interest rate) and the current yield is just under 3% which is not that great at all. On the other hand, [SEMB has had much better returns](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251824/ishares-jp-morgan-emerging-markets-bond-ucits-etf#/) and a higher yield of 6.18% which makes it more appealing, but it seems much riskier given its biggest exposure is to countries like Turkey, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, etc.

"Have 10k to invest - very high risk tolerance for this allotment. Ideas?I’ve come into some money recently, and looking for some high risk investments. I’ve got my long term investments that I’m comfortable with and I’d like to use these funds to try my luck at some higher risk plays - maybe for a few months to try and supercharge my savings (understandably, at the risk of losing it worst case).

Investing in upcoming stock splits - Chipotle, Broadcom, Sony.

I feel like this could be a good short-ish term play to try and capitalize on the splits. Open to thoughts on this. 

Other thoughts would be watching AMD as the stocks been hammered due to the alleged data breach, so keeping an eye on this and catching it during the dip could be good. I’m very interested in companies competing with Nvidia right now, such as AMD and intel which both have chips that claim to compete with Nvidias.

"Selling NVDA with $1m gainsI’ve decided I’m going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I’ve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I’m sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I’m a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn’t be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I’m also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can’t really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It’s anyone’s real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can’t imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I’ve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

"Getting on the AI bandwagonHello Everyone, I am already invested in the SP500 through Vanguard (of which AI giants like Nvidia and Google form a major part). I am wondering if it makes sense to buy individual GOOG and NVDA stocks at this point in time (when valuations and prices are high). Alternately, I am also thinking about buying more affordable but promising AI companies (I wouldn't know which) using the philosophy that a rising tide lifts all boats.

"NVDA after stock split won’t be like TSLA
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.",06-18-2024
"NVDA will see a near term pullback, even though it doesn't deserve it NVDA will pullback in the near term, even though it's a great company that has consistently delivered for its shareholders. Why must it come down? Well, I'm a firm believer that narratives drive market sentiment, way more than fundamentals or valuations. Narratives, especially when repeated, permeate. And for the past 5 days, the narrative builders have been relentless in giving a negative short term assessment of NVDA stock. By narrative builders, I mean the financial industry people on TV asked to comment.

I will give you an example. On Friday, Jim Cramer alluded to NVDA being overbought and how Larry Williams' model was predicting a pull back of the stock until end of July.

This morning, Fairlead's Katie Stockton was also on Squawk Box, saying that even though she firmly believes in the bull market, NASDAQ 100 will see some pain as soon as people see that NVDA is a bit overstretched.

Just 30 minutes ago, Jeff Kilburg of KKM Financial called that it's time to trim, take profits given that the stock added 1 trillion dollars in valuation.

There are countless others from different sources. I really believe that once you start to hear so many ""experts"" and street people talk like this, it is reasonable to expect that a stock will come down. Not because they are right in their assessment but because others listen to it and start to wonder about trimming their positions in a self-fulfilling prophecy. This happens even if only in the very short term, before correcting to the upside and pushing higher to new highs.

I actually think we are seeing the very pullback already: today, on a day when the Nasdaq is rising by 1.2%, Nvidia has found resistance around 0.3% increase and seems to be headed lower. Recently, NVDA has been the one pushing Nasdaq to new highs, so just this inversion is noteworthy.

I am not a bear. At least not in that sense. And I do hope NVDA pulls back 10-20% because I intend to buy more. Cheers.

"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fundKEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

"INVESTING Friday’s trading could trigger a $10 billion rush of demand for Nvidia shares. Here’s howThe Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) has an upcoming rebalance based on Friday’s market caps.

At stake is one of the top two spots in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), whose June rebalance is based on market cap values as of Friday’s close. Apple and Microsoft are the two biggest holdings in the fund, at roughly 22% each. Nvidia makes up less than 6% despite being only slightly behind the two leaders in market cap. Projections from a June 12 UBS note suggested that, if Nvidia climbs to second and bumps Apple to third, it could result in the chipmaker’s weight in the fund vaulting to 21%, while Apple would be slimmed down to just 4.5%. A 15 percentage point swing in Nvidia’s weight would mean that the fund would need to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares in the chipmaker — all on or very close to June 21, the rebalance date.

"Nvidia briefly passes Apple as second most valuable public U.S. company[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-passes-apple-in-market-cap.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-passes-apple-in-market-cap.html)

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years. It announced a [10-1 stock split in May](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-announces-10-for-1-stock-split.html).",06-05-2024

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is **77.90%**. 

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post. I would expect my returns to revert to the mean over time.",06-03-2024
"How, and what are the best way to financially analyze growth companies? Hey folks! I have a question—how to analyze a growth company.

In mature companies, it’s easy for us to value invest. But, growth investing..? I tried finding some things online but no luck yet.

I am assuming that the investor really needs to know the market in which the growth is happening to truly evaluate the potential of the company. For example.

"Since 2000, highest U.S. market cap = highest profit almost 100% of the time. As NVIDIA approaches Apple, what happens next?Exxon Mobil was America’s most valuable publicly traded company for much of the 2000s & early 2010s, as the oil booms during those periods delivered enormous profits. Since the mid-2010s, Apple (and eventually the rest of Big Tech) began to exceed Big Oil’s profits. For much of the past decade, Apple has been the most profitable and most valuable U.S. company, occasionally trading places with Microsoft, the 2nd most profitable U.S. company.

Which brings us to the current situation. Microsoft is worth $3.2 trillion; Apple is worth $2.9. Microsoft is actually making slightly less profit than Apple but has a shown a higher earnings growth trajectory in recent quarters/years. NVIDIA is worth $2.8 and making about a tenth of MS & Apple’s profits, but might double or triple its earnings this year. One of 3 things can happen:

1) NVIDIA takes #1 and grows into its valuation

2) NVIDIA takes #1 then loses it because it fails to grow into its valuation

3) Wall Street pumps Apple & MS stock higher so this never becomes an issue

"2 years of investing 68% increase! - but how to break the tech stock addiction.Hi all

Started investing about covid times 8k added, its worth 13.5k with a 68% change.   
Some of my big increases are  
NVIDIA Corp cost: 1,336.88 value: 4,319.46 <--- insane increase  
Microsoft Corp cost: 1,497.26 value: 1,976.98  
WisdomTree Art Intelligence ETF USD Acc GBP: cost: 1,285.17 value: 1,697.11  


I'v tried to diversify so i have some in the SNP500, a global growth fund, tiny bit in gold but these tech stocks and funds just keep going up! luckily i bought the nvidia stock a week before it doubled its like 223% increase!

This is a long term investing ISA so i kinda think i'm in a bit of a tech bubble and i know i need to spread my bets out a bit but its hard to break the tech stock gravy train and its also an area i know about so i'm kinda stuck as to what other sectors to put money into. 

how do you spread your investments, the last thing i wanna have is less than a 10% increase in 20-30 years because i'm strating to think AI is a bit of a bubble thats gonna pop hard.

"NVDA - Great at training but very bad at inference? Chamath Palihapitiya's comment*""AI is really two markets, training and inference. Inference is going to be 100 times bigger than training. Nvidia is really good at training but very miscast at inference.""* \- **Chamath Palihapitiya**

🔗https://youtu.be/1ZQ33OnGFWE

Can anybody elaborate on what Chamath meant by this? 

Why is Nvidia bad at inference? 

Is this about the idea that most of the value accrual will be on the AI application layer as opposed to the AI infrastructure layer? 

But then again - why does he believe NVidia won't succeed with its application layer (e.g., robotics platform, ...)?

Hope somebody can shed some light on these questions!

"DJT is 1538.41 times Revenues while NVDA is 35.89 times Revenues according to TikrAnd Nvidia has both phenomenal growth and profits as well as revenues as opposed to little revenue and massive losses like DJT.

*That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard.*  
*And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?*

"Is it easy to “beat the market” now?Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?

We’ve all heard the mantra “you’ll never beat the market” but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?

I’ve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it’s significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I’ve always been higher…for over a decade now. 

So hear me out, I’ve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  

With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I’ve found this sector completely destroys the overall “market.” Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it’s very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  

The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I’ve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I’m still beating the NASDAQ too.  

The contrarian’s argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I’m up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don’t see how the whole world economy wouldn’t fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  

I’m not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I’m just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I’m doing?  

Is there a point where the “market” is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that’s the real underlying answer to my question.  ",04-03-2024

"China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash DeepensWhat implications do you think will this have for US and EU semiconductor manufacturers? Any insights how much substitution Chinese chipmakers can actually realistically achieve? (I was under the impression they wouldn't be able to but perhaps things have changed).

**China Urges EV Makers to Buy Local Chips as US Clash Deepens**

- *Directive could hurt Nvidia, NXP and other EV chip suppliers*
- *Order is a response to US efforts to curb Chinese chip tech*

The Chinese government has quietly asked electric-vehicle makers from BYD Co. to Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. to sharply increase their purchases from local auto chipmakers, part of a campaign to reduce reliance on Western imports and boost China’s domestic semiconductor industry.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology asked carmakers this year to expand their buying of homegrown components to accelerate the adoption of Chinese chips, according to people familiar with the matter. The country’s tech overseer previously set an informal target for automakers to source a fifth their chips locally by 2025, but has grown dissatisfied with the pace of progress, the people said.

The ministry is now directly instructing firms to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible, said the people, who asked to remain anonymous discussing sensitive information. That means overseas chip firms effectively have to manufacture their silicon through a local foundry such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. or Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., one of the people said. During a recent tender conducted by a major domestic brand, one foreign bidder failed to secure a contract despite offering a price they estimated was 30% lower than the eventual winner, another person said.

The developments reflect Beijing’s stepped-up efforts to galvanize its own tech sector, a response to US attempts to curtail Chinese chip development via sanctions and restrictions on the sale of advanced technology. The Chinese directive on cars casts uncertainty over the business of companies from Nvidia Corp. and NXP Semiconductor NV to Renesas Electronics Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., which compete with local firms to supply the world’s largest EV market.

Shares in European chipmakers that supply Chinese EV firms fell in early European trading. Infineon Technologies AG slid as much as 4.8%, while STMicroelectronics NV slid 2.2%.

Many local brands buy a hodge-podge of other components from power management chips to microcontrollers and display ICs. Some carmakers from leader BYD to upstarts like Nio Inc. rely on Nvidia processors for instance to coordinate functions in their hyper-connected cars.

The MIIT didn’t respond to a faxed request for comment. BYD, Nio and Geely representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Beijing is increasingly intent on supporting a domestic chip industry it knows is lagging well behind foreign rivals, but critical to supporting the economy and maintaining a geopolitical advantage. The directive is in line with pledges this year to mobilize all means at its disposal to wrest technological supremacy from the US and other nations.

The central government may also be bracing for curbs in the auto sector specifically.

Washington is probing potential data and cyber-security risks posed by internet-connected cars from China, including EVs. US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has expressed concern that data collected by the cars could wind up in Beijing’s hands, and is overseeing an investigation that could result in restrictions on the sale of those cars in the US — measures that would go beyond a potential increase in tariffs.

A mandate in favor of Chinese chips also raises the prospect of further retaliation as Washington ramps up its containment campaign.

At the Two Sessions meeting of lawmakers this month, Beijing hammered home a longstanding goal to break an American stranglehold on key spheres. Under Xi Jinping’s watch, China has expanded state control of strategically critical areas from semiconductor manufacturing to quantum computing.

Against that backdrop, Beijing has endorsed the efforts of local champions such as Huawei Technologies Co. through subsidies and targeted policies. It’s now establishing a $27 billion-plus fund to drive chip investments and hiking spending on nationwide research to more than $51 billion.

China’s biggest auto chip and software providers include Huawei, Loongson Technology Corp., GigaDevice Semiconductor Inc. and Wingtech Technology Co. Many, like Novosense Microelectronics Co. and StarPower Semiconductor Ltd., have built significant capacity in so-called mature or lower-end nodes. The MIIT’s policy may soak up some of that capacity — at the expense of their foreign rivals.

The US and its European allies, meanwhile, have grown alarmed by China’s rush into older-generation chips. The Biden administration is mulling tariffs on those components in addition to other trade tools, but has said it is not considering restricting them using export controls.

While US rules introduced in 2022 slowed China’s development of advanced chipmaking capabilities, they left largely untouched the country’s ability to use techniques older than 14-nanometers. That has led Chinese firms to construct new plants faster than anywhere else in the world. They are forecast to build 26 fabs through 2026 that use 200-millimeter and 300-mm wafers, according to data from the trade group SEMI as of 2023. That compares with 16 fabs for the Americas.

"Risks of investing in ETP (Exchange Traded Products) compared to CFDs and futures?Update: After reading some articles and examples Daily ETP have Stop-Loss in them unfortunately... This means that long ETP would trigger a SL if the underlying stock drops \~16.6% in a single day. So that's how the ETP originators earn money.  

Hello Everyone,

Why are retail traders not completely ignoring CFD trades and going all in on low priced leveraged ETPs (pennies)?

Example is GraniteShares 3x Long AMD Daily ETC (3LAM.L) currently just 2.74$

We all know that chances are AMD will be more valuable in a year compared to now, as the AI hype wouldn't die in a year. There is too much market share to be taken away from Nvidia and the market doesn't even have too - the demand is currently way higher than the supply, so it's only a plus! The issue with futures and CFDs are that you pay fees, have stop loss and need to know very precisely how much and in which direction the market will move between the opening and closing of your position. With ETP you don't care, as you don't have daily fees or stop loss and inflation is your friend, as generally more money will be put into the profitable stocks sooner or later due to rising expenses and thus prices.

This ETP has made 20.1% in a day while AMD 5.25%

The NVDA equivalent has made from 6$ to 150$ in just a year. Using x5 leverage maybe could provide that return, but at a MASSIVE risk. How likely was it to lose money from NVDA 1 year ago by buying this ETP at just 6$? Similar ETPs for the other tech companies are already trading at far higher ranges than just 2-3$.

For some reason this Google ETP 3LAL hasn't reach it's ATH although currently GOOG is trading around ATH. I guess it has to do with when the ETP starts trading on the market or maybe it doesn't monitor stock splits/dillutions.

I am wondering who is on the other sides of those ETP trades? You cannot convince me that people are shorting 3LAM while it's at a silly 2.74$ (was around 0.3$ when AMD was 80$) and AMD just recently started it's AI hyped bull run. Sure it already made around 300% in a year, but so did NVDA and AMD started from way lower market cap! I was actually shorting NVDA around 500-600$ range, as I didn't do any due diligence on it's main product behind everything :( - the Tensor A100 and how many orders were for it etc.

Please try to give me arguments why 3LAM would be a bad investment to buy and hold for 1 year if AMD - besides AMD getting priced less than 202$ per share? The fees is around 0.3% per trade without any daily fees from what I could tell.

Another example is 3LVW if you think Volkswagen will recover (I do) :). It has massive debt, but pays 8% in dividends.

Disclaimer - I put have put my money where my mouth is, but I stay open to corrections about my understandings, as I have been proven very wrong recently about AMZN and why it's valued this high.

Why is math not working in some cases? Microstrategy did around x10 increase in a single year. The ETP did around 10 000 times increase?!

3LMI went from 0.01$ to 337.71$ - it seems like the starting price is the biggest factor, as this is not just x30 times increase (due to the x3 leverage), but an insane 3 377 000% - good luck for any crypto to beat that!

I couldn't find a single ETP in GraniteShares portfolio of products that achieved the opposite - starting from 1-10$ range and going down to 0.00001$ etc.",03-03-2024
"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too lateOnce a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report  
March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Marín Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestlé, L'Oréal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.  
The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.  
Worth the ride, until...  
But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.  
Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.  
When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  
On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  
All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

"Is it too late for SMH / NVDA?Hello,

I just started investing last month into Roth IRA. Honestly have always been a fan of Nvidia with my GPUs etc, however never had proper financial education until recently. 


Seems like everything's pumping right now and I'm not sure if it's the right time to buy?

On the other hand, i have SWPPX and VXUS into my Roth IRA right now. Wondering if it's smart to invest in individual stocks like SMH into Roth?

Which one is less risky? Smh or ndva?


Thank you!! ",03-01-2024
"Stock Market Hasn’t Been This Hot in Decades. Is the Rally Justified?This is mostly a straight copy paste from a Barron’s article. I’ve been reading a lot more noise from the financial press about overheated values. So I tend to peruse the articles that give multiple sides or data supporting their claims.

There are lots of Nvidia mentions, of course. But pretty much any pan market analysis is going to mention Nvidia.

From Barron’s:

https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-rally-hottest-decades-1ca7bcf5

> The S&P 500 has had an extraordinary few months, any way you slice it. The index is up more than 25% from its October lows, and as Deutsche Bank Macro Strategist Henry Allen writes, “The current rally is almost unprecedented.”

> The index is now up 15 out of the past 17 weeks, a feat that’s only happened one other time in the past half-century, in 1989. If it notches yet another gain this week, for 16 out of 18, it would be the first time that’s happened since 1971.

> Such a massive rally—largely resting on enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and a few big tech stocks —has led to concerns that we might be in a tech stock bubble

> Nvidia revenue and profits are quite real and they are growing at an astonishing rate. It results last week, the latest in a series of blowout quarters, is “Unprecedented. And it speaks to the power and durability of this A.I. craze,” notes Rosenberg Research President Dave Rosenberg. “Nvidia’s stellar results and positive guidance hammered home the point of how generative AI is proving to be transformative in every respect

> And while Nvidia’s valuation may be easy to justify, the S&P 500 as a whole looks pricey: It is now trading at almost 22 times forward earnings. As Essaye points out, a price-to-earnings ratio around that level was “previously only reserved for periods of quantitative easing and 0% rates, not quantitative tightening and 5.37% fed funds.”

> Of course, skeptics haven’t been right yet. The average year-end price target for the S&P 500 as tracked by FactSet, of 5,556, implies more than 9% upside left for the year. RBC Capital Markets has also argued that the index looks capable of supporting a valuation of 23.55 times. There is also the possibility for a near-term pullback before gains continue. [**really? Is that possible??? /sarcasm**]

The numbers of the S&P are pretty startling to me. Kind of like when someone goes out in the basketball game and scores 60 points with 15 blocked shots.

But one problem with all these algorithms, and back testing, is the past is the past. While human behavior tends to return in cycles, buying and selling of companies and technology, that hadn’t existed before is hard to be cyclical.

Like I just read an article that the gardening nursery that had operated for 90 years in my home city was shutting down. It occupies 15 acres of unbelievably prime real estate, and they were using it to sell poinsettias and shrubs and trees to locals. This is to say: areas change, and businesses change and just because something operated, profitably, for 90 years doesn’t mean it’s going to operate for 100. We’ve seen the same with newspapers and magazines and comic books, and we’ve seen entire industries spring out of nothingness and become vast. Mobile games can rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. Popping virtual bubbles on a portable telephone he’s not a business model that existed when I was a kid. I doubt anyone even dreamed of it.

Sooo, the S&P setting records can be alarming. Alarming if things that happened in the financial markets past need to happen or are likely to happen now.

But sometimes things change sufficiently that the rules get thrown out. For all the talk of the past.com bubble, the boosters in 1999 were dead right in that the Internet changed everything. They were simply ahead by maybe five years, and things didn’t change so much that you could forgo earnings.

"I'm ready to make a prediction.
The bubble will pop.

We're in a very similar place to the tech bubble. Back then the bubble popped because companies didn't produce revenue to match the hype.

Today this seems different because some companies are making money hand over fist. However, the companies making money are those producing the infrastructure for AI, we have yet to see much revenue generated from AI itself. The similarity is that we are expecting AI itself to generate revenue similar to the startups of the first tech bubble. 

Whether or not AI can generate revenue is a different topic. I'll simply say that the current expectations of AI don't match reality. Feel free to list the companies and products that leverage AI that are also generating significant revenue directly from that AI.

Nvidia makes chips, Microsoft and others use these chips to provide AI infrastructure, the bubble is in everyone trying to use this infrastructure to create products that derive revenue. If that revenue doesn't materialize, demand will drop for infrastructure and correspondingly for chips.

Nvidia, Microsoft, and others making money hand over fist is great for them, but it is not an indicator of the actual success of AI, only the attempt at success. Can anyone say Aeron chair?

"Investing in Quantum Computing Hey all I'm looking into the best Quantum Computing companies to invest in. I personally believe Quantum Computing is the next revolution in addition to what is happening with AI. I belive this will explode, especially within the pharmaceutical space. I know it's been in the works for awhile now but it is not mainstream yet as companies are still working through error mitigation and coherence issues. What companies or ETFs do you recommend investing in prior to this boom? It seems that it's a matter of when, not if, based on my research so far. 

Here are a few I've comes across:

-IBM

-IONQ

-Dwave

-QTUM (ETF) 

-NVIDIA (of course)

"Nvidia is the ‘Magnificent One’ now — but these rivals are closing inI’ve been accused of being a booster for Nvidia. And I’ve definitely been posting a lot on it. But it is, according to Goldman Sachs, “the most important stock in the world.”

And we only have to look at the earnings call and how it snapped a sinking market back forward again adding more money to its cap in a day than any stock in history. 

Okay. Rah rah. But what about the competition? That much money and someone(s) are gonna try and steal a piece and poach your employees. 

So this one is for the nays and even the yays like me who want perspective.

> The Nvidia bandwagon is packed and everyone is jumping on it. It’s fun to be right and more fun to be right in good company. But what if everyone is wrong? Isn’t it this type of mania and exuberance that should give the market pause? 

> Nvidia has effectively grown to more than 98% of the market for data-center graphics processing units, or GPUs, due to a complete lack of meaningful competition. This early lead has given the company unbounded pricing power, driving its margins in the most recent quarter to over 76%.

> over the past few months we have seen signs of competition entering the market. This will affect Nvidia’s margins and the company’s ability to continue to grow at such a staggering rate. 

> the competition is coming from an array of places [in addition to AMD who is predicting $4B for their new GPU] that include a number of Nvidia’s largest and most important customers. For example, Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS cloud has its AI chips for training and inference, Microsoft recently announced its Maia AI chip, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google continues to innovate on its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Oracle Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are also developing AI chips in house. 

> not as much an indictment on Nvidia as they are a realization by these companies that overdependence on a single source for AI semiconductors is a risk

> In short, competition is real and it is coming to Nvidia in a meaningful way. More competition pressures Nvidia’s pricing, margins and market share, as well as its rates of revenue and EPS growth. ",02-24-2024
"Growing number of stocks are joining the market rally — even as Big Tech still gets the most attention
If we’re in a bubble, as the AI doomsayers keep telling us, it’s a bubble that is pretty much encompassing the entire market. The headline of one article I’m quoting is: it’s not just AI.

So if you’re trying to be defensive, your only option seems to be to stock up on gold, oil, pitchforks, and shovels. Or buy a LOT of tinfoil to keep you and your family wrapped tight for…however long this lasts

> As the S&P 500 booked its best weekly advance since early January, one detail set this week apart: All 11 of the large-cap index’s sectors managed to finish in the green for the first time since November, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 managed to clinch its 13th record close of 2024

> “It’s like a rising tide lifts all boats. There is more participation in this advance. It’s more than just the ‘Magnificent Seven.’ This euphoria seems to be lifting up all of the sectors and a majority of the industries and stocks.”

> The rally may have been sparked by Nvidia's blowout earnings on Wednesday, but it spread well beyond the AI behemoth. Three sectors hit new highs this past week—tech, healthcare, and industrials. Financials and materials are less than 5% away from their peaks. Costco Wholesale, which sells more corn chips than microchips, is at a record too.


**S&P 500 Sector	Gain during week ended Feb. 23**

* Communication Services	1.49%

* Utilities	1.2%

* Real Estate	0.9%

* Energy	0.4%

> Most of the market’s 25% gain since late October was premised on the idea that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates starting in March—or May at the very latest. Recent comments from members of the Fed, along with signs of persistent inflation, suggest that the first cut could come in June or even later. Hopes for as many as seven rate cuts this year have faded away. **At some point, rate cuts will matter again.**

> The percentage of S&P 500 constituents trading above their 50-day moving average climbed to more than 67% on Friday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. While that’s still well below the high of 91% reached on Jan. 2, it’s a notable improvement from the lowest level of the year, which was just shy of 51% on Feb. 13

"In my humble opinion, Generative A.I. is the most idiotic bubble I’ve seen so far.There was the generalized Internet bubble of the 1990s, in which any company that added a .com to its name would see its shares skyrocket. Then came the Web 2.0 / social media bubble of the 2000s, and cloud in the 2010s. 

Compared to recent “new technological paradigms,” Generative A.I. seems to have the narrowest use cases, is prone to errors/hallucinations, and is not even a novel concept. Benzinga has been publishing A.I.-generated articles regarding stock price movements, analyst estimates, earnings results, etc. for years before the marketing buzzword “generative A.I.“ became mainstream. You can tell they’re A.I.-generated because they follow a cookie-cutter template and provide few novel insights. I’ve been thoroughly unimpressed with the essays generated by ChatGPT & the like; not only do they contain occasional errors (hallucinations), they’re far from the quality of papers written by competent humans. ChatGPT might be useful for below-average university students to get by, but I don’t see how its use cases are a $10 trillion+ market. For now, seemingly every Fortune 500 company has jumped on the A.I. bandwagon, as simply mentioning A.I. on investor calls automatically leads to increased valuations.

Big Tech is extremely skilled at selling hype & FOMO through a new buzz word every few years. I’m just wondering how long this mania might last before it deflates, as previous manias always do. I imagine first, the non-tech companies paying NVIDIA & the like billions of dollars for A.I. chips & data centers would realize the economic/profit gain from Generative A.I. is not as large as forecasted. Then eventually, it hits the tech companies selling the shovels. But this could take years to play out.

"Thoughts on SNPS and CDNS?Synopsys (SNPS) and Cadence (CDNS) are a near-duopoly in the EDA space (chip-design software and related), and both are popping nicely today (7% and 5% at the moment), undoubtedly due to NVIDIA’s rise today (15% atm), since NVIDIA is a major customer for both.  Both of these EDA stocks have had massive rises in the past decade (13x and 19x), and are now at P/Es of 73 and 80 respectively.

What are your thoughts on these two companies, and their stocks?  Obviously they should reflect the chip market, but are these PEs sustainable?  Any potential big risks on the horizon for the chip market?

"Nvidia-fueled tech rally puts Nasdaq Composite record in sightHah. I just wanted to have three threads in a row with Nvidia in the title. Though this title is taken directly from MarketWatch.

What I found fascinating about this article was how destructive the .com bubble was. That was in 2000-2001. Or 23ish years ago!  

The fact, I often brag about me being around, for that bubble, which gives me experience with it, and we’re still pulling metrics from that era

> An Nvidia-led rally is helping to push the Nasdaq Composite toward rarefied territory, with the tech-heavy index near its first record close **in 27 months.**

> The Nasdaq Composite COMP was up 346 points, or 2.2%, at 15,927 Thursday morning, near its record close of 16,057.44 set on Nov. 19, 2021.

> If the Nasdaq were to finish above that threshold 16,057) Thursday, it would end a drought of **564 trading days without a record close,** according to Dow Jones Market Data. That’s the longest such stretch since a run of 3,801 trading days running from March 2000 to April 2015, following the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Wow

> The other two major U.S. stock indexes — the large-cap benchmark S&P 500 SPX and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA — have scored a string of records in early 2024.

> The Nasdaq’s long drought after the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 left many investors particularly wary of declaring a return of the bull market after the index’s most recent slide. After all, the Nasdaq saw three rallies of 40% or more over the course of the bear market that followed the dot-com bust, with none marking the beginning of a lasting bull, 

There’s a lot of good points here. One that surprising is the fact that the NASDAQ composite hasn’t broken a record in over 500 days. 

Everyone is saying that technology is the only one benefiting from this bull market. But the NASDAQ, which is really tech heavy, has been under performing Dow and s&p. 

Another is like said: the .com bubble burst is still being felt today. And I wonder if a lot of people on this forum slamming Nvidia didn’t go through that bubble and now see anything similar and have Vietnam-like flashbacks and PTSD.

"Nvidia’s sheer dominance can be summed up by this one underrated numberMy other Nvidia post got a lot of traction, so I thought I’d continue the Nvidia party. there’s been a lot of talk comparing them to Cisco back in the .com era. 

I lived through .com era and it was vastly different. If you said you were an online mall, you could get $1 billion the next day. Because people understood malls and this Internet thing was going to raise all roofs. 

Pets.com? I know what a pet is..com makes it even better!

I remember the exact street I was driving on when the one trillionth radio advertisement for Amazon came on the radio. And I was like, what a stupid name for a bookstore. Amazon has nothing to do with books. And for years and years and years, Amazon, lost money. They only existed because that.com Bubble had lifted them so far they had Cash. Lotsa cash. But they were a joke for about a decade.

But the real big thing was almost none of those companies had a profit. They didn’t make any money whatsoever. None. No business. They were burning through cash with expensive offices, expensive staff, oh man, salaries for tech workers were astronomical.

The companies that did have a profit, we’re making pennies. Or there profit margins were incredibly slim. There were only handfuls of companies that were catapulted by the bubble that didn’t meet this criteria.

Cisco was in a similar situation to Nvidia. Cisco built the tools that would enable this tremendous new technology. but their net profit margin was like 17%. Vastly less than nvidias. Nvidia forward p/e is 54. Ciscos was 150.

If it’s a bubble, it’s nowhere near the size of the.com bubble. S&P 500 is P/E of 22. In 2000 it was 28.

> Nvidia did note that its margins for the latest quarter and the current one could represent a peak due to favorable component costs in the supply chain in the past few months. But Nvidia had “visibility” into a mid-70% gross margin for the balance of this fiscal year, which would take margins back to where they were before this latest high-water mark.

I own Nvidia, so I admit, I am biased. But I think anyway you slice those numbers, they’re pretty damn impressive. If it’s a bubble, it’s a bubble that people are buying into. And by people, I mean, giant, multinational companies. It’s amazing growth for a company so large.

"What's the role and future of Intel in Taiwan's geopolitical scenario?I don't know why but this topic has intrigued me a lot lately. So I'll start by saying that I'm a complete rookie on this. With this post, I merely intend to throw my thoughts out there to be challenged so I can learn from you guys.

From a geopolitical point of view, Intel strikes me as the ideal solution to the West. But their stubbornness over the last two decades has been a huge disappointment for the industry. Delays, reduced reliability, unfulfilled promises, and an overall loss of trust from pretty much everyone. If I'm not mistaken, that has been the consequence of poor management and the refusal to explore either fabless chip design or to spin out the Fab as a service business.

From what I've been reading, Nvidia and AMD have managed to get better chips, not because they have been better at designing them, but because the increased efficiencies of TSMC allowed them to go for lower nm.

If I understand this correctly, TSMC managed to get more efficient than Intel at manufacturing chips mostly for a couple of reasons: Taiwan's government subsidies and economies of scale. Functioning as a service that fabless chip designers could use to produce their chips has caused TSMC to engage in *a lot* more volume of chip manufacturing, as it's logical. That allows the economies of scale to kick in and make the processes more efficient. That paired with huge government support has the manufacturing at TSMC substantially more efficient than the one at Intel.

Now TSMC is 100% based in Taiwan, which is a geopolitical ticking bomb. And everyone is now scrambling to diversify their way as far away from China and Taiwan as they can. I guess the Chips Act is the most obvious move from the US government in that direction. This is prompting Samsung and TSMC to invest in opening new fabs in the US. Europe seems to be in a similar direction, but perhaps with milder strokes.

[I'm reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/165c0mq/they_would_not_listen_to_us_inside_arizonas/) that TSMC is struggling to replicate its way of doing business in the US. That should pose a problem to the political move the Chips Act intended.

But I haven't mentioned Intel. They have experience in opening and managing fabs on American soil. They have obvious support from the American government and they have now embraced the idea of offering their fabbing services to fabless chip designers - which from my understanding should make their processes substantially more competitive.

Now my conclusion of this whole thing is that Intel's success at spinning out new fabs that benefit from economies of scale is the key to this whole geopolitical knot. Maybe Samsung is another key player in this? I can sense there's *a lot* I'm not understanding or missing but I can't point my finger at what is it. Maybe someone over here can educate me a bit.",02-21-2024

"Anyone find it scary how many people say things like, ""just buy xyz stock and you can make 200%""?Seen comments around Reddit on different posts, other social media, and even heard family and friends say things like this.

"Buy high or find something else?Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a ""I have $X to invest"" post.

I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.

All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.

So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?

I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.

I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.

TL:DR
I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.

"Nvidia boosting revenue by self-funding its own customers?Thoughts on this?

A bunch of very speculative companies were revealed in a filing yesterday to have stakes. Many already known, but curious if this seems like something dubious to others, if you're essentially dumping money into companies so that those companies will turn around and spend all the money on GPUs. On the flip side, it does make sense that if one or more of these startups take off, they'll be creating organic demand for Nvidia products.

"Nvidia - cash out profits and buy an ETF or hold?Nvidia releases earnings on 2/21. There doesn't seem to be a consensus what the stock will do, especially given the fact that the price doesn't really seem to be tied to traditional valuations. I currently have over 300 shares, mostly long-term with a gain of almost 700%. I'm 52 and looking to retire in about 8 years, with an overall net worth (including house) of over $2.5M.

I've been considering cashing out a chunk of Nvidia and just putting it in an ETF like VOO to insulate me a bit from any potential massive down-tick in the stock. Unfortunately, most of the ETFs are also heavily invested in the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks, which includes Nvidia. I've also been trying to figure out what a good ""break-even"" type point would be, if I cashed out and took a 20% capital gains hit (federal + state) and how much the stock would need to drop for me to buy back in at a more reasonable price.

"Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.

Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.  


It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.  


Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.

Yes, electricity demand has been mostly stagnant in the past couple of decades (1-2% increase annually).

"Seeking Advice on NVDA Investment Dilemma - Diversify, hedge or ride the wave?


I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.

Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.

Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax.

"Can Nvidia continue its rise?Morgan Stanley stated that Nvidia's Blackwell chip will be the company's biggest highlight in 2025, with the success of this next-generation GPU expected to overshadow any remaining investor concerns.

This week, the bank reiterated its ""Overweight"" rating on Nvidia's stock, stating that the chipmaker remains one of its top picks for 2025. The optimism is driven by expectations of the success of Blackwell—Nvidia's next-generation AI chip.

The bank set a target price of $166 per share, a 23% increase from Nvidia's price of approximately $134.82 as of last Friday.

""When short-term data is volatile but the fundamentals are very strong, we are most optimistic about Nvidia. We believe we are approaching that stage now,"" the analysts wrote in their report. ""Despite transitional pressures, by the second half of 2025, the only topic will be the strong performance of Blackwell.""

Investors are already optimistic about the Blackwell chip, which is expected to launch in early 2025. Earlier this year, Nvidia's stock surged after CEO Jensen Huang said the demand for the chip was ""crazy,"" boosting Wall Street's expectations for sustained profitability growth for Nvidia.

Morgan Stanley added that the chip could become the ""core driver of revenue"" in the second half of next year, suggesting ""significant upside potential"" for the stock price.

The success of the new chip could also alleviate some of the short-term to medium-term concerns investors have regarding Nvidia's stock.

Morgan Stanley pointed out that investors are primarily focused on four key issues:

**1. Slowing Production of Hopper Chips**

Investors are concerned about the slowdown in production of Nvidia's current generation AI chip, Hopper. In the latest earnings call, the company forecasted a 69.5% growth in revenue for the fourth quarter, the lowest in seven quarters.

However, Morgan Stanley stated that the slowdown in Hopper chip production is a ""non-issue.""

""The reason is simple: we are a few quarters away from the end of Hopper's lifecycle. We won't directly link Hopper production to revenue because Hopper's revenue will last for about three quarters. Additionally, there is a significant backlog of orders, so now is the time to slow down production,"" the analysts wrote.

**2. Different Versions of Blackwell Chips Not Shipping Simultaneously**

Investors may be concerned that not all Blackwell products will ship at the same time. Nvidia has stated that it will release seven different variants of the Blackwell GPU.

""We have heard concerns that some products may not be ready, and we do not deny that there may be timing challenges for some types of products,"" the analysts said.

They added, ""This is a reasonable concern, but all Blackwell chips will be sold, even if this results in distribution changes among customers. We expect this to continue for a whole year, and it should not be a long-term concern.""

Morgan Stanley stated that by the second half of 2025, concerns about the Blackwell launch will ""completely disappear.""

**3. Competitors Eroding Nvidia's Value**

The analysts noted that in recent months, part of Nvidia's market value has shifted to other chipmakers such as Broadcom and Marvell. These companies produce ASIC custom AI chips, which are alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs.

""But by 2025, we believe the largest users of ASICs will actually shift their purchases back to GPUs,"" said Morgan Stanley. ""While we are relatively conservative in our revenue forecasts for Broadcom and Marvell's ASICs, we believe GPUs will significantly outperform ASICs this year.""

**4. Reduced Chip Demand**

Large AI chip customers are expanding their GPU clusters for more advanced computing. However, some financial supporters question whether the return on investment is worth it, Morgan Stanley noted.

""Both of these aspects are important, and we cannot rule out the possibility of market consolidation in certain areas,"" the analysts said. ""But we note that many of Nvidia's recent innovations have aimed at improving the efficiency of large clusters,"" they added, pointing to Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox, which will help expand its data center market share.

The analysts stated, ""Even with concerns about a cooling arms race in AGI, the growth in inference, sovereign training, and enterprise training applications are multi-year growth drivers, accounting for about 70% of data center revenue. Even if the arms race consolidates, we will still see sustained growth potential.""

Despite Nvidia's stock price having surged 170% in 2024, most analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia in 2025. The continued AI trade frenzy is expected to be one of the major themes influencing the stock market in 2025.

AI is about to disrupt everything, starting with customer service. Think about it: a $252 billion industry could shift its primary expense to AI tools next budget cycle. Companies will fire up subscription AI agents instead of keeping massive BPO teams. That’s just one example—there are multiple industries that are going to pivot like this.

And guess what? NVIDIA is at the center of it all. Their GPUs are the backbone for every major AI player—OpenAI, Google, xAI, you name it. Demand is already skyrocketing, and NVIDIA is scaling up production like crazy. They’re ready for this surge.

"NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New RallyNVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible. ",12-18-2024
"Which Quantum Stock to invest in? Avoid QUBTFollowing on from my [recent DD ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hadjii/quantum_computing_inc_is_going_to_crash/)on Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), a lot of messages and a 70% rise in share price that has cooked my puts, I decided I'd dive a bit deeper

# QUBT does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation.

[Monroe has more talent in his pinky](https://preview.redd.it/gk9l4glffb7e1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=645bae223cfaf7054b06f4fedcb50cb42b941647)

Similar to when evaluating biotechs, in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees. Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed. As I explained in my past post, QUBT's staff did not attain their Phds at leading universities (something which is **very important** given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent). Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms. This is a clear indication that their 'innovations' and patents are likely to fail commercially.

# For every technical staff member at QUBT, there is $42million in market capitalisation.

[Bearish signal: Big capital raises and no hiring](https://preview.redd.it/fjc1l70jfb7e1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e59911426fa5b04bad519efa0bfea459b1f221f)

Furthermore, even if I was agnostic on education and publishing background, just from a headcount perspective, they do not have the people. They are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms. And despite capital raises, including a recent [$50 million capital raise](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/11/quantum-computing-inc-announces-50-million-from-stock-offerings-to-support-photonic-chip-foundry/) and booming stock price, they have not shown signs of new hiring. The current market cap of $1.33 billion appears unsustainable, and works out to $42 million per technical staff member - that's more than my dad made in his entire life.

# Where has the money gone?

If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing.

There are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers, and unlike what they claim on their [website](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/research-and-publications/thin-film-lithium-niobate-tfln), suppliers do exist in countries other than China - see [Switzerland](https://lightium.com/), [USA](https://www.samaterials.com/niobium-compounds/66-lithium-niobate-wafers.html), [UK](https://gandh.com/products/crystal-optics/lithium-niobate-wafers). Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips ([which they are already falling behind on](https://iceberg-research.com/2024/12/09/qubt-is-already-running-behind-with-its-new-chip-manufacturing-hype/)) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google).

Also here is what Quantum Computing Inc’s foundry [looks like](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quantumcomputinginc_qci-foundry-plasmatherm-activity-7247977871216930816-MJtF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios), which notably [Iceberg Research](https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/) exposed them for lying about its size.

# But would QUBT really mislead investors?

QUBT has pivoted many times during its history: from [beverage company](https://iceberg-research.com/2022/10/05/quantum-computing-inc-qubt-on-its-way-to-vacuum-state/), to quantum software, artificial intelligence, and now quantum chips. It naturally begs the question, should potential investors believe QUBT's claims? [Milan Begliarbekov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-begliarbekov-33aaa77a/), the chip foundry director, sums up my concerns quite well on his LinkedIn:

"Intel potential comeback?Hey!

Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts.

First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market.

It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain.

That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around?

What do you guys think? Is this a buy opportunity now that the stock is so low, or is Intel too far gone to bounce back?

Equally, I’m sure we’ll see stories about great successes. But whichever way it goes there will be vast investment. So are you focusing your investments on AI platforms (if so, which), or hardware (Nvidia and others)  or Data Center REITs (American Tower, Equinix) or things like the Global X ETFs (which seem underperforming to me).

"$Dell EarningsI wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

"AI Spending Isn’t Slowing Down, the Mag 7 Stocks Are Still the Best BetMicrosoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, aren't going to stop pouring billions into chatbots.  



Although Nvidia saw a dip due to high market expectations, the long-term outlook for AI remains strong, with chip sales still showing impressive growth. While there’s competition from AMD, the overall demand for AI chips is skyrocketing.  



The Mag 7 remains the key growth driver for AI. Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising.



And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable—around 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).

Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with [the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html) to [attending the company’s GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html) to chatting with [CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like [AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

"20 Yrs old. Portfolio Update/AdviceHey guys so i’ve taken some advice from the last time i posted and decided to cut out google from my holdings because i’ve seen the impact that chatgpt has had especially through my experience on my college campus seeing the increased use. I’ve added PLTR before the induction into the S&P after carefully consideration and research I believe that it could be a great player in the future especially after reading about how effectively it reduces the time of underwriting at insurance companies from 2weeks to 2hours. I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity.

"MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantagesI think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.
While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36.
Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%.
MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds
One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance.
Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities.
There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",10-28-2024

"I'm new to Stock Market and I don't understand stock valuations.
Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing *really* good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises?

Super realistic market analysis by Motley Fool this morning 🙄,09-23-2024
"Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent DaysQualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%.

While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition.

Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business.

Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

"Oracle bumps up fiscal 2026 revenue forecast, lifting stock 6%Oracle lifted its fiscal 2026 revenue forecast on Thursday, pushing its stock up nearly 6% in after-hours trading. The tech giant now anticipates at least $66 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026, about $1.5 billion higher than analysts’ estimates. Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share.

Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies.

Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs.

As Oracle scales up its cloud and AI capabilities, it plans to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to support this growth, signaling continued momentum in its expansion efforts.

"Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positivesThe problem areas in the USA: --------------------------

\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.

\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, 

\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.

\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.

\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

Good areas: --------------------------------------

\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see 

tradingeconomics dot com USA productivity

\*- Gasoline is lower than last year

\*- Retail sales are going fine, \[ per  a recent NPR radio article \]

Nuetral ----------------------------------------

\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.

\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

My one man's take ----------------

"TSM investment?Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment?

Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow.

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

"Nvidia announces $50 billion stock buybackNvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback.

The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations.

Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter.

Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results.

Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans.

In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history.

With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.",08-28-2024
"Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value, first U.S. company outside of tech to do soWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway

Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old.


The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.”

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

"Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short ReportSuper Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%.

The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector.

However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

"Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings?This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights.

The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected.

The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market.

Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies.

The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion.

**Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling**

According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%.

However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time.

Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price.

At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down.

Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven.

**Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk?**

Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations.

According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report.

The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability.

Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June.

However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025.

**Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence?**

The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time.

Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications.

JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable.

Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed.

LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",08-27-2024

"Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading breakHey everyone 
After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls.

My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. 

My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. 

And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. 
I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. 

I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. 

Any and all input is definitely appreciated 

Thanks in advance",08-23-2024

Plan to withdraw some XEQT as funds are used for family vacations, rather keep them in that than an idle savings account. For other stocks, hoping they rocket over the next few years, and that looming monstrosity of WW3 doesn't kill this investment.

"AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stockAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter.

The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft.

Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees. AMD anticipates that the acquisition will positively impact its adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.

"TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp.

July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations.

As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range.

TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97.

TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half.

However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies.

TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance.

Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

"Understand this about INTC...# INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is.

*What do I mean by this?*

Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing.

Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet.

This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert.

*What exactly is Intel's bet?*

**The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share**

**Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both.**

Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. **The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets.**

With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one.

*What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets?*

Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years.

Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler.

TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.

*Should I become a bagholder?*

"AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonightEarnings from [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year.



[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges.



Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year.



Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion.



Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program.



Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope.



Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations.



The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales.



Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",08-01-2024
"Non competitive investigations - ELI5I have been wondering about this for some time, when the Microsoft-Activision merger happened, then France had an issue with Nvidia, now the US does too.

What I understand: the goverments are investigating the company because they have mostly a monopoly in the AI market and boo hoo, it's not fair for other companies.

What I don't understand: why does the government get implicated? If anyone wants to challenge Nvidia, make a better product with a better price and overtake them. How is it fair that nvidia has something 10 or 20 years in the making, like cuda , and now they should share because the others are late to the game?

"[$NVDA] Today’s strong buying activity is driven by two main factors**1. Microsoft’s AI Developments and Capital Expenditure Projections:** 

Unlike Google, Microsoft has already developed significant revenue-generating AI applications, such as CoPilot. Additionally, Microsoft has a unique advantage with its insights into OpenAI, the leading AI company globally, which remains privately held. No other public company has such a perspective. Microsoft is privy to specific data regarding demand and metrics for OpenAI’s consumer and enterprise solutions, which serves as a crucial indicator of AI sentiment, second only to Nvidia. Remember the partnership with Apple?



**2. AMD’s Earnings Report:** 

AMD has projected significant demand and growth, suggesting a positive trend. If AMD is experiencing this level of demand, it’s worth considering what Nvidia might be experiencing. AMD indicated no signs of slowing down in AI product demand through 2025 and beyond.

"Mega-caps vs. small capsThe current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices. 

Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative.



Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact

Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment. 

The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure. 

This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%.



Small-Cap Resilience

In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains. 

The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience.



Sectors in Focus

The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers. 

Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities.



Treasuries and Market Sentiment

The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%. 

Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday.



As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance. 

However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics. 

The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",07-30-2024

"Intel Aims For $1 Billion Software Revenue By 2027, According To CTO Greg LavenderIntel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Greg Lavender has stated that the company is making smooth progress in the software domain. By the end of 2027, the cumulative revenue from its software business could reach $1 billion.

In 2021, Intel achieved over $100 million in software revenue. It was during this year that CEO Pat Gelsinger brought Lavender from cloud computing company VMware to guide the chipmaker's software strategy. Since then, Intel has acquired three software companies.

I have a goal of getting to $1 billion of software and developer cloud subscription revenue, Lavender said, I think I'm on track to hit this goal by the end of 2027 ... maybe sooner.

Intel generated $54 billion in revenue in 2023, offering a range of software services and tools for rent, from cloud computing to artificial intelligence. Lavender said that his strategy is to focus on providing services in artificial intelligence, performance, and security, and the company has been investing in these three areas.

Additionally, he also stated that Intel has seen lots of demand for its upcoming Gaudi 3 chip, and he believes this can help the company take second place in the AI chip market.

So far, Intel and AMD's AI processors have not made much progress in undermining Nvidia's dominant position. In 2023, Nvidia controlled about 83% of the data center chip market.",07-12-2024

Revenue estimates are between 150 and 200 billion this year.  I dont see how that can grow much more without Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon crushing their own profit.  Capex goes right to the bottom line, so wouldn't those stocks go down if capex spending was greater than profit?  Then drag whole market lower?

"Nvidia  More Room to Run: Just Getting StartedA lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.

That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",07-01-2024

"Has the market topped already?The recent performance of the U.S. stock market highlights significant market breadth issues, with a notable divergence between the performance of a few large-cap stocks, dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven,"" and the broader market. These seven stocks, which include tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, have driven much of the market’s gains, with Apple rising 8%, Nvidia up 9%, and Microsoft increasing by 4% last week alone.
Percentage of Nasdaq stocks trading above the 50-day MA:


This concentration of gains has led the S&P 500 up by 1.50%, despite the Equal Weight S&P 500 index, which better represents the average stock, falling by 0.50%. This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes.

Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%.

"Bond ETFs: Worth or not? Are you taking a shot at them?The closer we get to the expected lowering of interest rates, the more I'm looking into purchasing Bond UCITS ETFs ***(I live in the UK, meaning we can't buy the usual US ETFs like BND due to regulations)***. A lot of fund managers have mentioned that this is once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy bonds and I tend to agree. Obviously, they have some vested interest in it, but the bullish case is clear.

1. If interest rates drop, then bonds prices will go up as yield and price move in opposite directions. Therefore, if the Fed and the BOE lower interest rates as expected in August/September, the logical conclusion is for those Bond UCITS to go up in price. (We saw the ECB, Bank of Canada and the Swiss Bank lower rates, but I'm guessing these didn't have as much weight as the Fed or they were simply tentative/not convincing enough).
2. If interest rates do not drop, then at least you'll keep getting a relatively good (historically for the last 15 years) yield on your bonds, therefore making some decent passive income.

Obviously, interest rates can also go up, but I think by this point, the chances are pretty much non-existent for that scenario even though it was being mentioned a lot a few months ago.

Now, the next question here is:

1. Which Bond UCITS are the best to get? Ones like iShares Global Aggregate Bond Market (£AGGG) or something riskier like Emerging Markets Bonds (£SEMB)? Here, my expectation is that AGGG would be safer, but returns could be higher with the likes of SEMB.
2. What would the expected price gain be like? Would it be 5%/10%/20% bearing in mind that rates are NOT expected to go back down to 0.5% like before, but somewhere in the range of 2.5%-3%?
3. Is the opportunity cost of not going into equities worth it, e.g. would equities stand a better chance of a gain in the same scenario? Personally, it ***feels*** like the US market is on the edge of a precipice given the price movement so far this year of companies like Nvidia. I'm getting a bubbly feeling and it seems like bonds are now a much more attractive alternative than they were 6 months ago.

Schroders made an interesting article about that - [https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/](https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/) - and from the look of it, equities tend to outperform bonds in most scenarios UNLESS there is a recession in which case bond investors tend to do a bit better. However, most of the times we've seen rate cuts, there's also been a recession (again, check the Schroders article). I've also seen that cutting rates usually ends up being a bearish indicator for the stock market although, again, that probably depends on whether there's going to be a recession.

I personally haven't ventured into them yet. Looking at [the price of AGGG](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/291773/ishares-core-global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf), it looks like there's still a good buying opportunity. However, the fund's returns so far have not been stellar (worth pointing out that it was started in 2019 so the returns are only showing returns in near-zero interest rate) and the current yield is just under 3% which is not that great at all. On the other hand, [SEMB has had much better returns](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251824/ishares-jp-morgan-emerging-markets-bond-ucits-etf#/) and a higher yield of 6.18% which makes it more appealing, but it seems much riskier given its biggest exposure is to countries like Turkey, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, etc.

What do you think of this? Are you getting some bonds or not? If so, which UCITS/ETFs do you prefer?",06-23-2024

2. **AI Systems Revenue**:
   * AI is the future, and HPE is at the forefront. Their AI systems revenue has more than doubled from Q1 to Q2, hitting an impressive $900 million. This rapid growth underscores HPE's strong positioning in the AI market.
3. **Massive AI Systems Orders**:
   * The cumulative orders for HPE’s AI systems have reached a staggering $4.6 billion, maintaining a robust double-digit quarterly growth pace. This is a clear indicator of the high demand and trust in HPE’s AI solutions.
4. **Cutting-Edge Liquid Cooling Technology**:
   * HPE holds over 300 patents in the area of direct liquid cooling. This technology is crucial for managing the power demands of accelerated compute silicon designs, making HPE a leader in sustainable and efficient computing solutions.
5. **Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA (NVDA)**:
   * HPE's collaboration with NVIDIA enhances their AI capabilities and product offerings. This partnership further solidifies HPE's position in the high-performance computing and AI markets.
6. **Valuation Compared to Peers**:
   * Despite these impressive metrics, HPE is significantly undervalued. It’s trading at just 8 times revenue, compared to Dell’s 19 times. This discrepancy highlights a potential for substantial upside as the market recognizes HPE's value.

# Why HPE?

HPE is not just another tech company; it's a powerhouse of innovation and growth. Their strategic focus on AI, IFaaS, and advanced cooling technologies is driving significant revenue increases and solidifying their market position. As the tech landscape evolves, HPE is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver outstanding returns to investors.

# Conclusion:

HPE's growth story is compelling and their current undervaluation offers a unique investment opportunity. With a strong trajectory in AI, IFaaS, and liquid cooling technology, HPE is poised to deliver exceptional value. If you’re looking for a tech stock with solid fundamentals and growth potential, HPE should definitely be on your radar.",06-18-2024

"VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves?Hello, 21 year old here

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right? Could people, in tech, working for cisco or nokia, really not see the future of aapl and msft back in the early 2000s? Was it really that blinding? ",06-13-2024
"Am I doing well? 21 y/oJust looking for honest advice since none of my friends trade. I started off with about 12.5k from working restaurant jobs in high school.  I've been trading for about 2 years but stayed mostly flat during that time, since the start of 2024 i've finally been moving positive. Honestly I have no idea if this is good or bad. I keep seeing people make 100k off nvidia lol.",06-12-2024
"Nvidia joins its megacap tech peers, becoming the fourth ""Magnificent 7"" stock to split since 2022. Stock splits are typically bullish for the companies that enact them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broad market, according to analysis from BofA.",06-10-2024
"Hey guys, I'm paper trading with Webull...And I woke up this morning and my 700 shares (200K green) of NVDA were sold while I was sleeping. Has this ever happened to you? What should I do,  I feel so violated.",06-10-2024
"Which company should I replace for a company like AmazonHey good day redditors, how is everyone, i need some educated guessing guidance here, I’m holding all my stocks for at least 7 to 10 years I wanted to get into a position in Amazon, do u guys thinks it too late and which company out of my portfolio do u think I could replace it with? Just a note my XLY and my PSA stocks have been getting hammered this past year, any advice would be greatly appreciated

Nvidia stock split wrong price degioI own 2 nvidia stocks. After the split (3 days ago) this is what my degiro acc says. I guess it's a bug? Anyone with the same problem? Thanks.,06-10-2024
"Looking to start my portfolio, what do i invest in?I have a few thousand dollars and want to start building my portfolio. I'm considering investing in Nvidia and a few other stocks but need more knowledge. My goal is to achieve a monthly return of at least 2-8%. I'm aware that relying on a single stock is risky, so I plan to diversify my investments. This could include a mix of stocks, bonds, and ETFs to balance risk and return. I'm also looking at dividend-paying stocks and high-yield savings accounts for consistent monthly returns. Regular reviews and adjustments are essential to ensure that my portfolio remains aligned with my financial goals and risk tolerance over time.",06-10-2024
"Rocket 1: Nvidia's Ascendancy in SMH ETF Widens the Gap Against The PackThe divide between Nvidia and the other constituents in the SMH EFT has noticeably expanded, soaring from a negative $100 billion just days ago to an impressive $300+ billion now. 

Considering this gap, what's the optimal trade strategy?

1) Invest in Nvidia and bet against the rest? 
2) Favor the rest and hedge against NVDA? 
3) Go all-in on all constituents? 
4) Perhaps there's a more strategic approach worth exploring?

"Nvidia's Forward P/E Breaks the Trend: What’s Next?For the first time in 5 quarters, Nvidia's forward P/E ratio has DEVIATED from a key trend. 

Since the AI boom in May 2023, Nvidia's forward P/E decreased each time after earnings, even as its stock price surged.

Nvidia is Still Massively Undervalued After Seeing All Insider Transactions in Recent Months,06-06-2024
"Nvidia's Meteoric Rise: Can It Sustain Unprecedented Growth?Looking at the fastest comp**** quarterly growth rates (CQGR) for S&P 500 companies since 1990, only 5 companies have sustained positive LTM Net Income growth from Nvidia’s current level ($42,598M or $42.60B) over the next 4 quarters. Their CQGR ranged from 5.65% to 10.57%, with a total growth rate of 17.94% to 35.20%.

The consensus for Nvidia's Net Income (GAAP) in 2025 is around $63B and $83B for 2026. Can Nvidia continue this momentum? With no competition in sight, the odds are in favor of Nvidia continuing to beat expectations, even if it's by a narrow margin.

"Feds set stage for antitrust probes of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAIThe Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the world’s largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations.

As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models.

The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft.

The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

The agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week.

"Why NVIDIA Stock Price Goes Up and Will Continue the Trend?Let's not be surprised by why NVIDIA's stock price jumps all the time. Let’s figure out why.

This is the chart of NVIDIA's earnings after its IPO. No words here, but let’s see why.

NVIDIA has a few major phases in its history:

1. Dot-com boom: In the early 2000s, all you needed was a website with a .com domain ending.

2. Gaming boom: Starting in the 2000s, technology entered the mass market, and the gaming industry began growing. It continues to grow today, and to play a high-quality video game, you would need an NVIDIA video card.

3. Cryp* boom: This started in the early 2010s and continues to this day. To mine cryp*, you need an NVIDIA video card.

4. AI boom: This is happening now. Can you imagine AI model training or running without an NVIDIA video card?

5. What’s next? I think the next big wave is biotechnology.

"Nvidia's Unprecedented 875% Growth: A Metric Bulls and Bears Must SeeWhether you’re bullish or bearish on Nvidia, there’s one metric you need to consider before making your next move. Historical data since 1990 shows no current S&P 500 company has achieved what Nvidia just did: 

growing its Last Twelve Months (LTM) Net Income from $4 billion to $42.6 billion in just six quarters. The closest comparison is Ford’s growth from $4.5 billion to $23.1 billion over the same 6-quarters duration from 1996 to 1998.

Nvidia’s (CQGR) over the past six quarters stands at an astounding 57.70%, translating to a total growth rate of 875.23%. 57.70% is quarterly rate, not the more common (CAGR).

While some might label this explosive growth as a market top or even fraudulent, others see it as the dawn of an extraordinary growth phase that could continue indefinitely. Whatever your stance, keep in mind that Nvidia’s recent performance represents a once-in-a-century phenomenon.",06-03-2024

"5/22 Daily Update: $NVDA, $WBD Partners with $DIS, $AMZN AlexaGM folks, here’s what's cooking today

All eyes on **$NVDA.**

**$NVDA** announced a 10-for-one stock split and is upping its quarterly cash dividend by a casual 150%.

$NVDA is now flaunting a market cap above $2.5 TRILLION for the first time ever. Nvidia is now bigger than the entire German stock market. It’s also larger than the combined market cap of the Italian and Australian stock markets. 

Warner Bros. Discovery **$WBD** and Disney **$DIS** have decided to buddy up for College Football Playoff games. They’ve signed a 5-year deal where WBD’s TNT will air two first-round games starting this year, and by 2026, they’ll add a couple of quarterfinal games to the mix.

Amazon planning to roll out an upgraded version of its decade-old voice assistant, Alexa. The cool thing is that they'll be charging a monthly fee for it. Because who doesn’t love paying more for something they’ve been using for free

Earnings reports worth mentioning today: Intuit ($INTU), Workday ($WDAY), and TD Bank ($TD).

"NVIDIA ETFs to Watch before Earnings With NVIDIA reporting earnings today, ETFs with the biggest allocations to the company may be a good play. Here's a quick list: 

* Grizzle Growth ETF (DARP), 
* Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC), 
* VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), 
* Invesco PHLX Semicoductor ETF (SOXQ)
* TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF (LRNZ)

Here's a link to a Yahoo Finance article about it: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html)

I've been looking these ETFs ex. DARP - NVIDIA is their top position at 19.4% of assets. They also have exposure to the underlying commodities that are in the chips, following the ""Energy Transition"" growth theme we've seen companies move to over the past couple of years. 

NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings. If not there will probably be a pullback on the tech side but I think NVIDIA will beat, based on their rapid buildout of infrastructure so far. Ex. As data center demand continues to rise, their revenue generation q-o-q will continue to grow.

I've actually experienced it make round-trips between the mid 40s and high 50s on multiple occasions. This leads me to wonder is 25% near the peak yield a fund can maintain (absent the growth associated with the likes of Nvidia) while still staving off erosion?

"Transition from growth to dividends?Hey everyone.  So as the title implies, I'm curious what everyone thinks about making the transition from a growth stock heavy portfolio to a dividend stock heavy portfolio.  

Background:  30 year old with just over 100k in a brokerage account. Approximately 70k in other retirement/tax advantaged accounts. The brokerage account as it sits right now is ~66% Nvidia with 25% in Divo, Jepi, and Pflt.  The remaining percentages are in some growth stocks.

I am toying with the idea of restructuring the portfolio so that it is more dividend heavy but I would obviously have to sell Nvidia to redistribute in any significant way.  The thing I'm having trouble with is my hesitance to let any of my Nvidia position go.  Nvidia position is 575 shares at ~$36 average cost(currently 115 per share).  It is my personal belief that 575 shares of Nvidia could be worth a very large amount of money in 5 to 10 years time.  

Maybe my doubt is coming from hitting the 30 year old milestone and I'm overthinking things but figured I'd ask for your opinions.

"Dividend Growth Portfolio helpHello, as this is more dividend focused reddit I want to ask for advice. I want to make a long term dividend growth oriented portfolio. I have these chosen, my broker in EU does not have typically suggested vanguard/schd ETFs and some stocks I see often around the net so there is some similar ones.

"Portfolio CritiqueHey everyone 👋 

I just started investing this year and really fell in love with the concept of the “dividend snowball” and wanted to share my strategy and see what y’all think!

Note: this is not a 401k or Roth - those have very easy, safe etf plays. But they’re boring and this account is for fun/leftover money.

Being in my mid 20s, I’m more focused on two things - dividend growth and growth companies with the potential to pay dividends (ex: google and meta recently announcing dividends). I also look to have a solid portfolio of 20 companies (not including schd), most of which are supposed to be buy for life. I’d like to be pretty diversified, but I’m most familiar with tech and financials due to my job and almost every position is a company I personally use in my everyday life (except for my spec plays).

I’m trying to get the allocations to be a bit better - some positions like VICI and CP are overweighted just bc of how I started and others are weighted heavily or lightly based on opportunity- NVDA and COST didnt stay low for too long, SBUX and SOFI are easy DCA.

I have two spec plays, PLTR and SOFI that are kind of low cost gambles, they’re a $15 here or there kinda thing. Their balance sheets are pretty solid and I have a decent understanding of their business models so that’s why I picked those - I’m very aware of their cult-ish status lol

I do like to have around 4-5% in SCHD purely for “motivation” as building dividend growth stocks doesn’t increase your annual returns as much. Sometimes seeing “number go up” is important lol

Let me know what you guys think my top 5 or so or bottom 5 plays should be and why or just any general critiques you have! Maybe I should cycle some out eventually for something else, maybe I’m too underrepresented in some area.

Companies I’m looking at, but didn’t have good entry points: DPZ, TOL, DKS

"Using M1 Finance 'pies' to 'direct index' - can it be done?Relatively new investor, so forgive me if this is a dumb question. Currently, I am using fidelity for my retirement and brokerage accounts but I am not incredible impressed by their UI. Been looking into alternatives (at least for my brokerage accounts). I know that M1 Finance and a few other tools offer 'pies' or the ability to create target allocation portfolios and then contribute to the portfolio, mitigating the need for you to perform individual trades. I also know that they support fractional shares.

Knowing this, would it be possible to set up 'pies' that track indexes and in doing so 'direct index' into the same fund? For example, I currently invest in SCHD. Would there be anything to stop me from creating a pie 'SCHD-like investments', set the individual stocks to mirror the SCHD allocations, and let it run?

Hypothetically, this would let me:

* Bypass the expense ratio (not huge, but still a saved expense)
* Own stocks directly (direct dividend payments, which I love)
* Better track allocations across multiple indexes (so if Fund A and Fund B both invest heavily in NVIDIA, I can better track that weakpoint and plan accordingly).

Speaking to drawbacks the only ones I can think of are:

* Tax efficiency? Not sure if index funds do anything behind the scenes that operates as a tax dodge
* I would have to manually keep up on the allocations. Though in SCHD's case and many other index funds, they only reallocate once a year - so I don't consider this a ridiculous effort.

"will an AI Cartel be the next big dividend growth stocksMeta broke the mould for new age big tech by beginning to pay a dividend this quarter, Microsoft and Oracle already pay dividends which have a high rate of compound growth but make up only a small proportion of share price.

In the recent AI conference NVIDIA began the formation of their license subscription model by which users can buy a License to a top GPU server for $4500 annually. In Q4 2023 Nvidia posted earning of $22BN which is a mamoth month for a company which never generated profits like this prior to the AI rush. The key takeaway I found from this is as well as NVIDIA offering a subscription based model META, MSFT, AMAZON, GOOGLE and ORCL will all offer access to the servers as a product. In essence creating a cartel on the AI market where the majority of the profits is kept within the group 

All these companies have a common theme, record profits in Q4 2023. With Meta moving to dividends and revenues breaking record could we see the start of a substantial dividend growth from these key holders of the AI market. With profits this high you would expect shareholders to start demanding this cash returned to investors either through dividends or Share buybacks

"Rebalancing Question: Looking to sell Nvidia (NVDA) to exit Verizon (VZ)TLDR: Should I sell ~40% of my current NVDA position to make an exit from Verizon and break even?

Hey all,

I usually don't like making posts but I need some suggestions on what to do with 2 positions. As a young retail investor in 2020, I got baited by a yield trap dividend stock, Verizon. At the time I was just looking to maximize my passive income and didn't understand the fundamentals (debt, earnings-to-expense ratio). I just got baited by the shiny big yield (6.47%) but the stock has done nothing but depreciate since I bought it. In total, it makes up ~21% of my brokerage account and I have lost about ~20% of the total value I put in. The average purchase price is around $50.97. Again this is in a brokerage.

Fortunately, I struck oil at the same time and bought a lot of NVDA with an average price of $167 (currently at $778). I took out my initial investment and profited when it hit $520 so while I still have a position it is considerably smaller.

My question is do I sell some more NVDA to exit Verizon? I would be selling about 40% of NVDA position just to break even and make a complete exit, with the complete exit I would invest in some value stocks like PEP or PG and maybe some more growth stocks like TSM, PANW, or maybe just QQQM/VOO. I could also reinvest it into my ROTH account which is more focused and has about a 13% return.

I was talking to some friends and they suggested that I just sell the Verizon at a loss and reinvest in NVDA. While I do think it can go higher, I am starting to doubt some of the gas left in the tank for NVDA so it makes me more uncertain.",02-22-2024

"JEPQ vs SCHD; noob here, why would anyone put money in SCHD?I am doing alright with my long-term investing so far, growing ok, decided to check out this sub with interest in growing some passive income over time as well. Been seeing MANY people suggesting or actually putting money in SCHD. Is it just the diversification factor? I have been looking and comparing and other than the unfortunate inclusion of TSLA in JEPQ I don't understand why anyone would invest in SCHD.

Plese forgive whatever I may be missing here (and please educate me?), I am totally new to the dividend stuff, and fairly new to investing in general.

What I am seeing is double to triple dividends with JEPQ (for the sake of argument let's call it 8.75 vs 3.5), and while I get there is very little history here and the two are relatively equally flat over the last couple years valuewise;  Consumer Discretionary has been a strong sector and is better held by JEPQ. So coupling that with the fact we are in the infancy of the AI era, doesn't that position JEPQ to blow SCHD out of the water in overall value over at least the next 10 years as well?

Even if SCHD recovers this year to alltime high we are talking 5% from where it is now right? I understand the fund goes way back compared to JEPQ, but if one takes into account that any progress made from 2014 was lost to 2020, really the gains start there right?

From this document, does it mean I can just treat NVDX as nothing happened, and the strike price and underlying price both remain the same as before the dividend. In the ""worst"" case, if the CSP is exercised, I will end up with 100 shares + $2.17\*100? Am I understanding this correctly?

"Learned options and made about $15k doing a couple trades every work alongside my FT job this yearI've been involved in the stock market since 2017 starting off by doing stock trades without any fundamental or technical analysis which didn't take long to realize it's not an efficient way to make money.

I then opted to be a passive trader by buying into ETFs and just letting them grow over time which worked out great however I've always heard about options and it was very intimidating at first but late last year I decided to pick up a book that teaches options trading for beginners and particularly focus on covered calls. Things started to make a little more sense and I began selling/writing covered calls on existing positions I had which you'll see in the beginning months. Then shortly after that I began learning about other strategies and liked the idea of selling short puts or cash secured puts to generate residual income. As you'll see this was when I went from generating a couple hundred dollars a month to $2-3k/month.

The style of trading I enjoy is basically being a seller rather a buyer since I've read most option contracts expire worthless so I try to sell contracts for credit and the cash reserved for those contracts I leave in a money market account which generated 5% earlier this year and went down to 4.2% in the last 2-3 months once the fed cut the rates. It's not life changing amount of money but it's definitely enough to where I can see the potential in being able to double next year.

My filter criteria for looking at contracts to sell are the following:

Delta: 0.2-0.4  
IV: <= 60%  
Options volume: >= 500  
DTE: <=60 days

The reason I'm posting this is to let others who are new to options that it's a journey not a sprint and to be patient. The other reason is to share my learning with others and see if you have advice, pointers, learning resources. I am looking to continue growing and learning about options so I'd like for others to share useful resources if they have something to share. Thank you!

"Final Stock Option Plays Dec-Jan 2024/25So, with all the chatter about the upcoming tariffs under Donald J. Trump and China’s export ban on rare earth metals like gallium and germanium, I’ve decided to play the downside on some stocks. I made a post last week I think and now I have narrowed it down to just puts. Feel free to chime in.

# 1. Micron Technology (MU)

* **Why:** They’re neck-deep in semiconductors, which need rare materials like germanium and gallium—both of which China is restricting. Tariffs and supply chain disruptions will hit them hard. Plus, geopolitics isn’t doing them any favors.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 12–24 months for supply chains to diversify, so they’re stuck for a while.
* **Play:** Long put, slightly OTM.
* **Expiration:** 12–18 months to catch the peak of the pain from shortages and tariffs.

# 2. Dell Technologies (DELL)

* **Why:** Tariffs + restricted materials = higher costs and squeezed margins. Their reliance on Asian manufacturing and inability to adjust quickly makes them a sitting duck.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 18–36 months to realign supply chains and figure things out.
* **Play:** Long put, ITM for a faster hit.
* **Expiration:** 6–12 months since the short-term damage from supply chain issues should surface soon.

# 3. Jabil Inc. (JBL)

* **Why:** Electronics manufacturing giant = huge reliance on rare materials. Rising input costs and delayed supply chains are going to crush profitability.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 24–36 months to adapt their supply chain and stabilize.
* **Play:** Long put, OTM. This one’s more speculative, but I’m expecting extended pain.
* **Expiration:** 12–24 months for the long-term fallout to play out.

# 4. Visteon Corporation (VC)

* **Why:** Auto electronics supplier that’s caught in the semiconductor storm. Supply chain delays and material costs are going to hurt, plus the auto sector takes forever to recover.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 18–30 months because the auto cycle is slow as hell.
* **Play:** Long put, ITM for quicker downside action.
* **Expiration:** 12 months—short-term hits from semiconductor shortages are likely.

# 5. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)

* **Why:** GPUs rely on the very materials China’s restricting. Add tariffs and supply chain headaches, and you’ve got some serious downside risk. High valuation means any bad news could cause big drops.
* **Recovery Timeline:** 12–18 months, thanks to their dominance in GPUs and AI, but near-term volatility is the goal here.
* **Play:** Long put, OTM for speculative gains on short-term instability.
* **Expiration:** 12–18 months to ride the volatility before they bounce back.

That’s the plan, folks. Tariffs and rare earth export bans are gonna wreak havoc on these stocks for the foreseeable future. Hoping to cash in before they figure out how to recover. Thoughts? Criticism? Tell me I’m wrong! 🔥",12-11-2024
Bro this is tough. Missing everything on nvidia options this week.I’ve been limiting myself to trying to just lock in some gains every day around 200 a day. Last Friday I had a big loss but before that I was gaining 10 days in a row. A couple times if I held I would’ve gone crazy but I let it go mostly. This week though it was rough. On Monday got nvidia options and at one point was up 200 but I decided I’d wait a bit and ended up losing. Same thing Tuesday. Wednesday and Thursday I lost like 10 bucks a day. Then today I buy 20 put options at .23 a piece and sell the them at .33 for that 200 gain that I kept missing. If I had waited like 25 minutes it would’ve hit 1.50 a contract. An hour later it hit 2.60. Couldve recouped so many losses. Would’ve made 400 into 5200. It sucks and I know “no one goes broke taking profits” but when I’m in this hole it really becomes a brain worm. Idk how to tell when to hold and when to fold.,12-07-2024
"I need some perspective on liquidating my assets and pursuing an Option strategy.This is just a thought that I had and I would like some perspective from the community, I have a portfolio with a bunch of Stocks on which I am long-term bullish. I own only stuff that I personally believe in and also want to support so to speak. E.g. I never bought Tesla even though I knew that it would perform well and a lot of upside potential.

I have a rather large position on NVDA and I don't mind buying more, so I am already selling CSP currently, but only for a contract at a time... so my thought was, why shouldn't I simply liquidate my assets. This would allow me a) to take home some profits and b) start from scratch and allow me to rebalance. But instead of just going ahead and purchasing the stocks, I would set up more CSP and have higher contract sizes, so for instance 5-10 NVDA contracts instead of just 1. And while doing that, I lock in some profits from the premiums... obviously, I run the risk of losing out on the upside performance, but if we do a simple mathematic example to follow this thought process through:

assuming NVIDIA hits 200 by mid 2025 (rather bullish scenario, but not impossible).. that would mean roughly 55USD profit per stock. With a position of 500 NVIDIA stocks, that would be 500 \* 55 = 27500 USD profit.

Now, lets do the same exercise with a 5 CSP that have an expiry of 30-45 days, and yield around on average 400 USD per contract. 5\*400 = 2k.. since we do want to lower the risk and lock in the profits earlier, around the 50% profit mark.. lets assume its 2k/2-3wks. 6mths = 24wks... lets take a conservative stance, and say we hve 20wks / 2wks (average duration of an option contract)  = 10 \* 2k = 20k... so yeah, if NVIDIA hits the 200 mark by mid year.. I have lost out on 7.5k profits, on the other hand.. if I go slightly more aggressive with some of my CSP positions and lock in higher profits.. the 30k is doable in 6mth?

I dont know, just thinking out loud here..still very new to all of it but I like learning and hearing the communities feedback.",12-06-2024

"Sell, roll or leave - $145 Jan17 NVDA callSell, roll or leave alone - $145 Jan17 NVDA call option

Theta is -0.0917, meaning each option is losing $9.17 per day per contract if the price stays the same. Looking at OptionStrat, it looks like I should close it because even if the stock goes to $154 by mid January, it loses money. Of course, if it goes to $157 or above, it will actually be slightly profitable. Any thoughts? Maybe wait a few more weeks, til about 28 DTE? 



ChatGPT says this:

The decision to sell your NVIDIA (NVDA) call option depends on your investment goals, outlook for the stock, and an understanding of the option’s time decay, as indicated by the theta.

What Theta of 0.0917 Means

Theta measures the time decay of an option. A theta of 0.0917 means that, all else being equal, the option will lose $0.0917 in value per day due to the passage of time. Since an option contract represents 100 shares, this translates to a daily loss of $9.17 in the option’s value.

Context for Your Call Option

	1.	Current Situation:
	•	Strike Price: $145
	•	Current Stock Price: $138
	•	Expiration: January 17, 2025 (~45 days remaining)
	•	Theta: 0.0917
Your call option is currently out of the money (OTM) because the stock price ($138) is below the strike price ($145). The option’s value is primarily composed of time value, which will decay as expiration approaches.
	2.	Implications of Theta:
	•	Your option will lose $9.17 per day regardless of stock price movement unless the stock price rises significantly.
	•	This time decay accelerates as expiration approaches, especially for OTM options.
	3.	Break-Even Analysis:
	•	For the option to gain value, NVDA’s stock price must increase quickly enough to offset the daily time decay.
	•	If you believe NVDA will not rise above $145 + the premium you paid for the option by expiration, selling might be prudent.

Should You Sell the Call Option?

Consider these factors:
	1.	Outlook on NVDA:
	•	Do you believe NVDA will rise above $145 by expiration? If you are confident in a price surge (e.g., due to earnings, new product launches, or other catalysts), holding the option may be worth the risk.
	•	If NVDA’s price stagnates or declines further, the option will continue losing value.
	2.	Remaining Time:
	•	With ~45 days left, the option’s value can still benefit from stock price movements, but time decay is becoming significant.
	•	Evaluate how much you’re willing to lose daily in time decay if NVDA doesn’t move favorably.
	3.	Premium Value:
	•	Check the current market value of the option. If the premium is still significant, selling now can lock in residual value instead of risking further decay.

Recommendation

	•	If you’re bearish or neutral: Consider selling the option to minimize further losses from time decay, as the stock is below the strike price with limited time left.
	•	If you’re bullish: Hold the option if you expect a strong upward movement soon, but be mindful of the accelerating time decay.

You could also explore rolling the option into a later expiration to buy more time if you remain bullish but concerned about time decay.",12-02-2024
"Is it ever worth buying outrageous calls/puts?Here’s the example I’m currently thinking of, but I feel like I may just not understand what’s going on (I am new to options). 

I am thinking the AI bubble will pop sometime in the next year and leave NVIDIA somewhere around peak crypto bubble, probably a bit more. 

I can’t financially justify buying a put for hundreds of dollars, so I’m thinking of extending the timeline past when I think the bubble will pop and buying one for lower and therefore cheaper. 

More concrete example: I think it’ll go to $50 sometime in late 2025/2026, so I buy a cheaper $10 put for Jan 2027 even though I don’t think the price will go that low. 

I’m assuming that when the bubble pops and price goes way down, the price of all puts will go up including the near-zero ones, especially the further future ones since no one knows where the popping will stop. 

Is this sound logic or is this stupid? Not asking about thoughts on NVIDIA price or bubble, just how the price of outrageous puts will act. ",11-29-2024
"Selling puts on already owned tickerNeed input on my thought experiment. Lets say one has a good amount of a stock that they want to continue to hold for the long run. Quality stock and trending up. Wouldn't it make sense to sell puts ~~against that~~ and just collect the premiums? Reinvesting those into the underlying ticker?

Example: 10,000x shares of NVIDIA trading at 138.5

Sell 100 put contracts with $90 strike expiring 2 months out with a $0.11 premium

Collect the $1,100 premium and reinvest into NVIDIA

Only minimal risk would be it hits strike and is exercised and you end up buying NVIDIA at a good price?

Am I missing something? You could do the same(ish) with covered calls but potentially more risk of exercise given that the stock is trending up?

"Disney Options - PT Raised from $108 to $127 on 11/20/24 NVIDIA has its earnings release on 11/21/24. If NVIDIA (NVDA) beats earnings expectations, it could trigger a positive market reaction, particularly in technology and growth stocks, including Disney (DIS), given its potential exposure to broader market sentiment. While Disney is not directly related to NVIDIA’s core business, the positive earnings could:


	1.	Boost Investor Sentiment: A strong NVDA earnings report often lifts the overall market, particularly indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy ETFs (QQQ). This could create a rising tide effect for Disney’s stock as part of the broader market.


	2.	Stimulate Risk-On Behavior: If NVIDIA’s performance beats estimates, it may encourage investors to shift into equities, potentially benefiting consumer-oriented companies like Disney.


	3.	Sector Rotation: If tech rallies, it could spill over into growth and entertainment stocks, especially if Disney’s valuation is seen as favorable.

All in all: If the broader market trends upward tomorrow, DIS could rebound slightly, making this an easy call options play. ",11-19-2024
"Defensive Options strategies around a position - suggestions please Hey all, longtime listener, first time caller.  As anyone not living in a cave knows, Nvidia earnings are this Wednesday.  I have a rather large position that I'm quite nervous about protecting, and I'm hoping the very knowledgeable people on this sub may be  able to offer me some strategies to protect this position.  Just for full disclosure, I do NOT trade options, but I've used sold covered calls, puts and occasionally will sell both OTM puts and calls around earnings hoping the stock doesn't move much either way.

OK.  The most obvious strategy is to buy puts but given expensive they are. I don't think this is a reasonable option for me.  The only thing I can think of is maybe buying ATM puts and selling January OTM calls for around the same premium as the puts currently cost.  Any feedback on this idea?

"Evaluate my plan for next weekSo tomorrow, I am planning on starting a poor man’s covered call with Nvidia. I know that the volatility is high due to election, earnings upcoming on the 22nd, etc. I was thinking about buying a call with a strike price of 125 with a delta of 71 for a premium of 36.8 per share for August 15th expiration. My plan was to then sell a call against it with a strike price of 170 for December 6th 2024, collecting a credit of 250. I would then roll the short call up if I reach %50 profit on the option and roll it down if the price of nvidia drops. I know in going to have to be cautious about the high volatility with the stock with earnings coming up, as I definitely don’t want the short call to get assigned. So I’m going to be monitoring it daily and keeping tabs on it. I also am pretty bullish in Nvidia at the moment, even with the stock reaching ATH seemingly bi-weekly, so I’m hoping that the long call gains some value. If it gains some value (anywhere from 10-20%) over the coming months, I’ll plan on closing it and opening another long call. 

My question is whether this is a good plan and if there are any major flaws in my reasoning/plan. Any help appreciated, thanks!

"Beers sharpening claws: Nvidia?Major banks are peddling Accumulatur Structures on Nvidia to HNIs.

Accumulators aka ""I kill you later"" is a contract between a buyer and a seller,

1) Buyer commits to buy a fixed amount of shares periodically (daily/weekly) at a pre determined price for a certain period (eg 1 year).
*This price is at discount to current price of the stock. In this specific case, 93$ per Nvidia share

2) If the stock price rise above a certain threshold then a 'knockout' clause is activated. The buyer is allowed to keep the stocks accumulated between the start of the contract and the time till knockout is activated. Once knockout is triggered, the contract stands cancelled. In this specific case, it is 130$ per share of Nvidia.

3) If the stock price falls below the pre determined price (in this case 93$ per Nvidia share), buyer has to buy 2X the number of shares at the pre determined price.

"Selling covered Puts Long termMarket in general is bullish on stocks like Nvidia, Apple, AVGO. I am interested in selling covered Puts or covered calls on the stock far away from strike price. For example, Buy $110Put and Sell $115 put for net credit of 100$  on AVGO for example and max loss limited to 400$ for Exp or June 2025.

That’s 20% ROI. Even with market downturn like Carry trade tantrum 3 weeks ago, chances are AVGO will not go below $120. Does such a trade makes sense? I understand that theta decay (good for me) will be really low for first 9 months and only in last 3 months I start getting real returns. Main benefit I see is that I don’t have to monitor such positions day to day or week 2 week. 
If I want to invest 10k in similar positions, I am planning to push 4-5k now and rest in next few months if AVGO falls further.

Any comments/suggestions like I can go for $10 or $20 spread instead of $5? ",08-30-2024
"The range of NVDA premiums has shocked me over the last 12 hours. 
For some context I’m quite new to options and have been experimenting with some covered calls on a paper account. 

I’ve been aiming for around a 10-15% profit yearly from premiums alone which has been going well, however I had a look at NVIDIA in the early hours of this morning to see some great premiums on calls I deemed to be relatively safe. 

I bought 400 shares at 119 (again paper account), selling calls for 131, 137, 141, and 144, gaining me £445, £345, £167, and £174 respectively, all expiring the next day (30th August). 

I wanted to see which of these would execute and which I would keep, just to experiment, however after looking again today at premiums for NVDA for a 1 or 8DTE, they’re massively smaller, at around 1/9th of the gain I would have netted early this morning. 

I’m well aware that the premiums I got are huge, and I assumed this was due to NVDAs high volatility, however I’m struggling to understand how the potential premiums can fluctuate so massively, and how I would be able to find similarly massive premium opportunities in the future. 

Excuse me if my terminology isn’t all quite right, as I’ve only started a few weeks ago, so any help would be amazing!

"Educate me on your analysis process and strategy if IV < HV with earnings An example due to the recent market turbulence...NVDA has earnings coming up. If you look at IV rank vs HV, you'll see that HV (purple line in lower graph) is higher than previous, and IV rank is going up (due to earnings) but less than HV.

"Margin call on selling puts strategy I started option trading(selling puts) around few months back and unfortunately due to recent stock decline, I had a situation where my account has a margin call. I have a lot of holdings in stock like QQQ, Nvidia,but don’t have enough cash to buy close those put options. I have been thinking the following strategy to close those options:

1) Close options according to margin/market value in descending order. This usually means where options are deep in the pocket(80% profit), because it means use less money to reduce margin.

2) Because I have previous years loss carry over $3000. I should sell the options with profit first and then loss. 

3) For those options with loss, should I sell options where it is more unlikely or market value? For example, I have two NVIDIA puts. One expire on 12/20/2024 with $95 and the other one is 12/20/2025 with $120. If I sell the $120 one, the current loss is larger than $95, but it is a less likely option which is safer. However once market rebound, the gain will be larger if I hold the $120 option.

What are your thoughts? Is there any other strategy I can use? Like roll over?",08-08-2024

"Buying LEAP calls Nvidia Very new to trading and still figuring things out so do not judge me.

What do you guys think about buying a LEAP contract that ends September 20th? Nvidia earnings report is August 28th and their recent earnings reports have boosted the share price and caused the stock to rise.

The premium for this contract is around $15.85 and break even is around $135.

So basically this contract would mean that I’m betting before September 20th (when the contract ends) that the share price will go above $135 and if it does I make $100 per dollar it rises above $135??

"Is it true that an options contract loses its value after a stock split?I'm thinking of buying some AVGO calls but kinda uncertain on whether I should do it before or after the split.

From what I read online, it seems the saying is simply that the contract will readjust in qty to conform to the new split and there's no price loss.

However, I've also heard some people claim that the contract may actually devalue right after the split, due to IV crush. Some also claim the contract will be traded in a diff market thus lose its liquidity and value.

 I've also observed a lot of traders were selling their options right before Nvidia's split the last time, which was why Nvidia dipped abit right on the stock split date.

So which is which? Is it better to just hold off from buying any AVGO calls until 15th july then? so far it does seem like AVGO is indeed straddling instesd of rising as the last two days before the split approaches",07-11-2024

Question for you guys, can you sell long dated put spread as a way to alternatively long a stock?

My thought behind is that in 2 years with 100% return if above strike price to me it seems really decent. And if I just put 8K down buying nvidia shares it needs to be at 1600 pre spilt in 2 years for me to achieve the same return, which I am not sure of.

"NVDA short thesis (puts)Nvidia has soared to new heights that have never before been seen. Easily overtaking Apple as the most valuable company in the world. Now to my immaculate and brilliant short thesis

• Nvidia is currently valued at over $100,000,000 per employee 
• Nvidia has a PE ratio of 71 compared to Apple’s 31
• Book value per share of $2.00 half of AAPL which has a $4.84 
• Annual revenue of 60B compared to 383B from Apple
• 7B cash on hand (28B for Apple) 

Now this may just seem like a comparison of why Nvidia is trading at insane multiples compared to Apple. But let’s not forget Apple has been the darling of the Dow for the past 15+ years and it’s going nowhere. Especially after an extremely strong WWDC event that reminded people why Apple is the best company in the world. Nvidia is due for a pullback at these levels. 

AI has been nothing but a buzz word as hundred of mega-mid cap companies scramble to acquire chips to create there own LLM and other AI models. However no company yet can even remotely show how their billion dollar investments in AI has born any fruit. As these companies quickly see how fruitless AI is compared to its costs. Many companies will abandon the “AI gold rush” and NVDA strong forecasted growth will shrink and companies stop buying chips/cancel existing orders. 

My final and most well thought out point of my entire short thesis. My 83 year old grandma just asked me if I’d heard of that company called Nvidia because she just bought some in her retirement account. If this is a sign for a pullback I don’t know what is.

"Option pricing and the underlying trading strategyPricing of options is usually done (as was done in BSM model) using the dynamic hedging strategy. Today, we have algorithmic trading so a question naturally arises. Are options priced fairly based on other possible algorithmic trading strategies?

Case in point the strangle to straddle conversion by rolling over the legs of the strangle as and when the stock price moves. I love to take the example of Nvidia as it has actually been working out for me so far. I bought a 4 month out strangle (and I will leave out the details as that will drift us away from the main point) and I kept moving the legs of the strangle as and when the stock price drifted away from the original strike by $50. I am now having a straddle for significantly lower price than the current straddle price for the same expiry and strike. 

Going forward, if I keep rolling the legs, I will have a gut with increasing width of strike overlap (thereby increasing minimum payoff at the time of expiry).

Question is not about the strategy above. The question is about the option pricing using various algorithms possible using algorithmic calculus on various legs of the options (and beyond). Pricing options using a specific algorithm will result in a specific price. BSM uses dynamic hedging and prices options based on the various trajectories that the stock price can take assuming a known mean and variance (IMO an incorrect hypothesis which definitely fails to work with stock log-returns).

But using the same (incorrect) hypothesis, we can also price options based on other trading strategies like the one I pointed out.  Then the question arises -- what if the two prices resulting from two trading strategies result in vastly different prices? If the actual price is closer to the first pricing strategy which is lower, then we know that it is underpriced based on the second strategy.

Assuming we have a portfolio of strategies, if markets were to be efficient, the pricing should be the same no matter which strategy is used to price the options. Is this true in reality?

Also, if you can point me to references that price options without assuming much about the distribution of the returns and possibly using a different underlying strategy than dynamic hedging, I would love to know about it.",06-07-2024

"Another straddle vs strangle questionThere have been plenty of questions about this issue like in here

[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ymbwpk/long\_straddle\_vs\_long\_strangle\_what\_are\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ymbwpk/long_straddle_vs_long_strangle_what_are_the/)

I understand that if you are trading (as in selling options, or buying them in the hopes of increased volatility), considerations are are different. However, if someone is just purely buying options for the final payoff from it, then isn't strangle much better?

Nvidia is trading at about $1060 now. June 2025 straddle costs $388 while if you go $100 away from the strike, then the price of the strangle is almost $300. It's as if you go one strike-gap away, and the premium of the strangle goes down by almost as much as that. 

Say Nvidia price either drops to $560, or shoots up to $1560 in this duration. Calculating the percentage PnL, the straddle would have given 28.8% profit (= 100\*(500-388)/388) while that of strangle would be 66.6% (= 100\*(500-300)/300). I am not including the time value here as it make little difference in the overall conclusion. So it looks like if the stock price does see a big drift, then strangles offer a lot more leverage than straddles. Basically the catch is that stock price has to go above the premium for a positive payoff (again ignoring the time value).

So if the trader is expecting a high drift in the stock price, it looks like buying strangles is the way to go. If this drift happens too soon, then straddle will definitely have more time value than the strangle so there is that factor. However, assuming that the drift will take a while to materialize, then strangle seems the obvious choice.

I'd appreciate it if you can provide feedback and correct me wherever I am going wrong in my thought process.",05-27-2024
"Am I misunderstanding option contract volume?Hi all, first time posting here. I've been learning about options for a few months and planning to start paper trading soon. Besides learning about the actual workings of derivatives, I've been learning up on the strategy that TastyTrade and OptionsAlpha promote (45 DTE, short 30 delta call/put or 16 delta strangle/condor, IV is mean reverting, IV usually is overinflated, etc). I think I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals and mechanics of options but there are a few things that haven't clicked for me yet.

Sometimes I'll browse the tasty watchlists just to look at trades and familiarize myself with what's out there. Often even if I look at underlyings with great liquidity, I find the liquidity and bid/ask spread of the options seem bad. For example, today (May 21) I looked at EWZ, M, NVDA, SPY, QQQ, BABA to sell 38 DTE puts (closest available expiry to 45) mostly looking around the 1 SD mark.

-Macy's (M): highest volume that I see is 10
-Nvidia (NVDA): volume is 100 right at the 1SD strike, most nearby contracts have volume below 50
-Brazil ETF (EWZ): a lot of contracts have 0 volume, one has volume over 100
-NASDAQ (QQQ): most contracts have volume below 100
-Alibaba (BABA): volumes are below 100, many are single digit
-S&P500 (SPY): several volumes between 100 and 1K, one strike with volume above 1K, still several with volume less than 100

Are my expectations just out of line, and this is normal? Is the ""Volume"" in units of 1K or 1M or something? Is this actually the daily open interest and not volume?

"Calendar nightmare! Robbed of thousands but lucky to have gotten out unscathedThis is more of a rant/story than dialogue.  However, this is a great example of the importance of being able to enter/exit easily with your broker.  ALWAYS pay attention to red flags and potential issues, as they tend to arise only at the worst moments. 

&#x200B;

To begin, I switched to IBKR about 2-3 months ago after my previous broker, Schwab stopped allowing calendars on cash settled indices (Requires much more margin).  After trying out about a dozen trades over the past month or so with success, I was starting to like IB.  I hate the UI, but the general layout was customizable and organized.  

On one of the first few trades I entered, an unusual glitch occurred.  I was trading some iron condors and had hedged them with a 1dte call & put.  SPX went up massively the next day (Nvidia earnings) and the call was worth around $15.  Since the put was worth nothing, the bid was 0 and the ask was 0.05.  On any other broker it would show up as 0.025 and the total position would be 15.025 for ex., but on IBKR it was 7.5 for some reason.  Thought nothing of it and closed only the call. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to March 26th and I enter some calendars, short 3/28 - long 4/2 with 12 5260c's, 6 5190p's and 6 5200p's.  On the 27th the price closed at 5250 and I decided to hold and hedge the position with both put and call spreads, potentially earning an enormous amount if SPX is near 5260 or 5200 at close.  Around midday, with the price at 5255, I hedge again for about $500, basically ensuring I earn something from this trade regardless and make up to 6-7k if it lands at 5260, with the plan being to sell 5-10 mins before close.  At 15 mins to close, the position starts gaining massively, I am incredibly lucky to have the price at 5260, now up $3.5k.  

&#x200B;

I open up the desktop app to sell and I notice the position, which should be worth around $17, is only 8.3.  I had never held a calendar this long and forgot about the glitch, as the 5200p & 5190p 3/28 were now worth 0.  I open up [optionstrat.com](https://optionstrat.com) to see the price of the position so I could just sell with a limit order on IBKR without seeing their prices.  While I could've done this, the price was jumping around 0.50 per tick, only updating every 15 seconds or so which means I could get robbed $500 if I get filled at the bid, so I move onto the next idea. 

&#x200B;

It is now 3:52pm ET, time is running out fast and I need to get out now.  I buy to close the 5190 and 5200 puts for 0.05 to clear the glitch, but then instead of the the two calendar positions staying together as a 3 leg combo in the IBKR portfolio, where I can simply right click and close the whole position, it breaks them apart and scatters them in the portfolio tab where I have around 20 individual hedge positions.  I am frazzled and panicking as it is now 3:55pm.  I go to enter a new combo order to close 6 of the 5190 - 5260 3-legged calendars but in the heat of the moment I accidentally enter 5180 instead of 5190 and the order goes out live.  I immediately cancel it, it doesn't fill and I start to re-enter, but the desktop app freezes for 30 seconds as it does from time to time (even though it is the only thing running on my computer and have good connection).  

&#x200B;

It's 3:58-3:59pm and by now, the value of the position is moving around violently, I decide not to get rid of it and wait until after close as it is practically unsellable without a several hundred dollar haircut.  Anyways, the unthinkable is happening, the market is about to close at 5260 and I am up $6-7k.  For a brief few seconds I am victorious, celebrating mentally.  I que up only the 12 5260 calls, prepared to sell after close.  I have to wait until exactly the close since there is a great deal of gamma risk on the short 3/28 calls. The order window pops and I select a market order.  I look at SPX, see it at 5258, I ready the calls, see the price at $17, click submit, confirm and walk away with a huge sigh of relief, that is until I check the screen a minute later... In the final 10 seconds the price had gone from 5258 to 5254 and in an instant at close, to 5248.  I had sold only seconds after market close for 11.80 when only a moment earlier they were running $16-$17 a pop. This wiped out the entire $6-7k of gains. SPX dropped in 10 seconds the entire trading range of the day... unbelievably unfortunate.  Easily the biggest buzzkill of my whole life.  While I was indescribably angry, I was grateful I didn't wear a huge loss as SPX could've fallen lower.

&#x200B;

Looking back, it is obvious there is something I could've done to get out. There is no comparison however to the immense pressure of the moment, the dizzying movement, and being entirely thrown off by not being able to sell in a familiar fashion. While I had known the price gapping down was a possibility, I thought the worst case scenario it would drop 5 points, maybe wiping out 2k of ill-gotten gains.

I spent hours yesterday thinking of what I could've done differently.  I could've kept the 3/28 puts and sold the position blind using the optionstrat prices, tossing in a lowball offer.  I could've just went with the entry error and sold to open the 5180 puts.  I could've sold the 5260 4/3 calls 10 seconds before close, subjecting myself to mild gamma risk. At 3:59pm, I could've queued up the long and short 5260 calls and market sold that entire side of the position.  

It doesn't matter, it's over.  Not going to blame IBKR, not going to get mad at myself, not going to do anything stupid.  Only thing to do now is move on and avoid something like this before it happens again.  I had been in similar calendar positions with schwab several times and was always able to exit when I needed to every time without issue.  I probably will move to another broker and will extensively practice each scenario, checking for potential problems.  The lesson I learned was: issues should never be ignored.  You almost always get a warning.

&#x200B;

Tldr:

Was in a wild calendar position that gained thousands all at once in the minutes before close.  I needed to sell in that exact window and got tripped up by order entry issues.  Sold seconds too late and got unlucky, losing all the gains. ",03-29-2024

"Investment idea Put on DDOGAs you all know, the market is at all-time high levels and popular stocks like the largest of the S&P 500 have an uncharacteristically high P/E rating. According to Howard Marcs, the pendulum is swinging further to the bullish side.  

&#x200B;

In summary, stocks are expensive right now and obviously the conclusion is that maybe shorting stocks now would be a good idea  

&#x200B;

 But what are the criteria and considerations? 

&#x200B;

I created a screener that filters out stocks with a P/E ratio above 100 and then searched through stocks. My criteria were that I don't take companies with a strong earnings growth rate because they are more likely to have earned this valuation and can quickly grow into their valuation from the market so I avoided stocks like Nvidia 

&#x200B;

Case study:  

&#x200B;

I found Datadog inc (DDOG), a company that produces software for companies, which is not a bad company with an average revenue growth rate of 62% over the last 5 years. Nevertheless, Datadog suffers from high operating expenses so that it has been making losses since the company entered the market. And to finance their activities they issue more shares to raise money which makes the individual share worthless. But to understand this case mathematically, let's build a bull case to understand how overvalued the stock is. Let's assume that the company's revenue grows 50% next year and somehow they manage to turn -1.6% net profit margin into 10% net margin which would be 319 million earnings in 2024 and about 0.96 cents EPS with what with the current price 125 dollars would result in a P/E ratio of 125 at the end of 2024 where the company would still grow unrealistically and you can also say that the company simply reinvests a lot in itself but the current TEV/EBITDA is also 65 which is extremely expensive.  

&#x200B;

So in conclusion I would say that I personally think that the problems like an unprofitable company and the risks like stopping growth are just not included in the price at all and therefore I buy a put option which expires in more than one year according to my previous calculation I say that the intrinsic value of the company is maybe 64 and I sell my put when the price is at 110 which should give me a good risk and I think that the price will probably fall below 110 dollar.

"Choosing covered calls in this volatilityHi - love this forum - thanks for all the useful info.  I have a question about covered calls-  basically is anyone trading one week calls in this volatile climate?  A little background: I’m newish to options after a long hiatus but have had recent and past success with basic calls/puts and various spreads.  Decided to give cc’s a try bc we've accumulated a fairly large buy/hold portfolio and it’d be great to use cc’s to increase earnings.   With the volatility in the market these days, these covered calls have been the most stressful options strategy I’ve ever done.   I’ve been choosing 10&20 deltas but the stock always seems to be close to hitting the strike price by the end of the week.  I had three assigned just last week (and sadly one was Nvidia)  Luckily the market was off yesterday so I could buy everything back for a tiny gain (except nvidia); but Monday morning I woke up to super high stock prices and some of my fav stocks assigned.    
‘Am I doing something wrong? In some instances the premium doesn’t even seem to be worth the trouble at those particular deltas.  Would love to find some success with cov call but don’t want to lose some of my fav stocks I’ve held for decades.  It’s in a tax free account so I’m not particularly concerned about having them called away and then repurchasing - just don’t want to have to pay thousands more to repurchase when the cov. calls are only worth a few hundred $.

All the calls are expensive relative to ATM volatility, while the puts are all cheap. This should give you an idea of sentiment in this stock and given that the front months IV is always going to be a bit pumped going into earnings, I would avoid buying outright calls, you would need to be very right to avoid getting killed by the IV crush that will inevitably follow.

As you can see from our ranking tool, that all the calls are still expensive relative to the ATM volatility, while the puts are all cheap. THis should give you an idea of sentiment in this stock and given that the front months IV is always going to be a bit pumped going in to earnings,I would avoid buying outright calls, you would need to be very right to avoid getting killed by the IV crush that will inevitably follow.

So I have chosen 2 upside scenarios to look at and one downside, because you never know.

I like to allow my view to have a chance at working and hope that a good report will set the trend for the next 3 months. So my first scenario I am looking to see what can I get if we have a run towards the $1000 area, but I want to be able to make money well before we get there..

I am going to trust the system and choose the top pick which is the 930/980/1010 call fly 1x3x2. It is a ratio fly that has a great ""trade score"" (where the AI system assesses the risk/reward not just running monte carlo historical VAR simulations but also forward-looking too) 

To see what my risk is, here is the HEAT MAP of that trade,

Historically this structure is fairly valued but still well below the average price of a similar OTM fly at this stage of the cycle.

The other option would be the regular 940/980/1020 call fly, also expiring in May. I do like this one too as you know what your max downside is and it is pretty cheap at around 50 cents

https://preview.redd.it/nuxzv6iwtkjc1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=72e2c78c0a01577f910973224f0740bd38dad8ef

For those that would prefer a more shorter time frame I did take a look at a trade in the March expiration, so still giving you a little bit of time to work with. Looking at the chart it isn't difficult to see a potential quick run to the top of that channel which would come in at $822

So with that in mind,

[you have 28 days to get above $800 ](https://preview.redd.it/od5dkjpcukjc1.jpg?width=763&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98243b6d93caf8c5cdf0199e5c317cb254bb45ab)

As this fly is currently in its 22nd percentile it is relatively cheap and I think a worthy punt.

There are no guarantees that we go up so why not have a little look at the downside....

We could easily retrace back to the $625 area but I want a wide range and then give myself 2 months to get there.

The $620/$645/$670 put fly, at a mere 36cents is a great little downside trade

"NVIDIA.SPY.SPX How I trade Options using Elliott WaveThis is an Elliott Wave analysis on how I approach the market.

**The key question the market will answer this week:** 

1. Are we in wave iv of circle (c)? (highest probability) 

2. Are we already in wave v of circle (c)? (lower probability) 

3. Are we still extending in wave iii? ( lowest probability) 

**My primary count has us in wave iv, let's see what we can expect from the market based on this premise.** 

The move down off the high in the last 2 hours of trading on Friday looks to be a 1/2 setup, if this is the operative count, then we can expect the market to continue downward in a direct fashion targeting the 4968-4961 (zone 1) to 4961-4934 (zone 2) SPX region. 

What the market does from this region (zone 1/zone 2) will tell us whether the move completed as a running flat (meaning the market will not break the low established on 2/13 @ 4920 in the immediate present). 

&#x200B;

 **BUT... OR...** 

The move to 4968-4961(zone 1) can also be a bigger wave 1 and if that's the case, then the market should retrace back upward in a **corrective manner** toward the 5000-5010 region (resistance area). 

From there we would get a sizable move down toward the 4870-4851 SPX region.

 **HOW DO I TRADE THIS WITH ALL OF THESE IF'S?** 

You can buy short term PUTS targeting SPY 495/494 region. 

The market should bounce from this region before deciding on whether to continue making ATH or breaking down further. The way prices move thereafter will tell me what the market is likely to do with a high probability. 

***I have 495 PUTS purchased last Wednesday. I will exit either Tuesday or Wednesday depending on what prices do.*** 

**HOW DOES THIS PRICE ACTION LINE UP WITH NVIVIA AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL HAPPEN?** 

I’m expecting a wave (iv) pullback in NVIDIA that should hold above 622.

 **Scenario 1** 

The price action on the SPX between Tuesday and Wednesday will be a telling sign, if the market reaches my target region in the 4968-4961 to 4961-4934 by Tuesdays' close or during RTH on Wednesday, then I expect NVIDIA will continue to extend. 

**I'm using the SPX price action to help with NVIDIA because NVIDIA has extended beyond what is considered normal projections from its low in October.** 

**Scenario 2** 

The market reaches the 4968-4961 region by Tuesday's close. Starts the next bounce. The market nears the resistance region of 5000-5010 after moving in a **corrective manner** by Wednesday’s close. 

This price action to me suggests NVIDIA is going to drop the market down and our bigger 1/2 is playing out on the SPX. PUTS on both NVIDIA and SPY. 

This analysis (Elliot wave) must be performed daily to get closer and closer to discovering the highest path (probability) the market is likely to take. I will know more about these paths on Tuesday afternoon and still more on Wednesday midday during RTH. ",02-19-2024

"Good sources of information more important than understanding technical analysis??Hello, I have been trading options for years now and I still don’t know what I am doing. We all agree that trading options is gambling. But also I realized that nowadays I spend more time doing research on Reddit or talking on online groups than doing actual technical analysis. 

Most of my trades are %50 based on experience on how I know the stock has performed in the past (just fast glance without drawing lines or anything) and %50 based on what my friends on discord/reddit trade or have read and share. I keep track of all my trades and surprisingly without doing any kind of analysis I am still earning about $1000/month on average. I know it is not much but the simple fact that I am positive just by doing trades talking to people surprises me.

So I wanted to know the opinion of other traders on this. Do you do technical analysis? Which resources do you use to make your trades (which online platforms and groups do you use)?

Also I noticed that most of my groups people always trade the same options (NVIDIA, TESLA, MICRO-STRATEGY, SYP…) Which are the stocks you trade the most?",02-14-2024
"Poor man covered call on a growth stocksHi, I have never traded a poor man-covered call before.

 The profit in that case would be approx. 64$. The market value of the stock is at 313$ though, which would be a profit of approx. 73$. Its showing me a gain of 89$ and i couldnt find out why the value and premium of the option are different.

"Is holding onto NVDA long term a bad idea?Pretty much a complete beginner here, looking to do more with my savings. I’ve been holding onto some options for a couple of weeks now, literally just £100 each as I don’t know enough to put more at risk. I’m up 18% on nvidia now and I’m aware there’ll be a drop at some point. I don’t really want the anxiety of checking stocks all day as I’m the type of guy who’ll just sit there staring at it go up/down rather than getting on with what I’m meant to be doing. So, I’d rather just hold onto it long-term. Typing this out now, I guess no one knows how things will pan out.

# Nvidia Locks In $700M AI Play

Nvidia has closed its $700 million acquisition of Israeli AI startup Run:ai, a move designed to optimize AI infrastructure and extend its dominance in the booming artificial intelligence sector. Regulatory hurdles? Cleared for takeoff—at least in Europe.

**Opening the Playbook**

Run:ai’s software, which helps maximize the efficiency of Nvidia’s GPUs, will now be open-sourced. Translation: competitors like AMD and Intel can use the software too. Why share the crown jewels? Nvidia’s move could be a play to quiet antitrust critics while expanding its influence across the broader AI ecosystem.

The startup, which Nvidia has worked with since 2020, adds a critical layer to Nvidia’s growing empire—helping power everything from data centers to cutting-edge AI systems.

**Antitrust Drama**

The deal wasn’t a breeze. Regulators in the EU gave the green light after a deep dive but didn’t miss the fact that Nvidia already controls about 80% of the GPU market. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice continues to take a closer look, adding a hint of uncertainty to Nvidia’s unchecked expansion.

For Nvidia, the stakes are high. As AI reshapes industries, its latest acquisition shows it’s not just chasing innovation—it’s determined to own the infrastructure behind it.

# Jeju Air Tragedy Sends Shockwaves Through Aviation

Boeing shares dropped 2% Monday after a tragic Jeju Air crash in South Korea killed 179 people, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in the nation’s history. Investigators are now looking into potential causes, including a bird strike and landing gear failure, as South Korea orders emergency inspections of all 737-800 planes in the country.

**The Timeline**

Here’s how the tragic event unfolded: Flight 2216, carrying 181 passengers and crew from Bangkok to Muan International Airport, declared a mayday after receiving a bird strike warning. The pilot aborted the first landing attempt, but during the second attempt, the landing gear failed to deploy. The jet skidded off the runway, struck a wall, and exploded into flames. Only two crew members survived.

Officials retrieved black boxes for analysis, while the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing are lending support to the investigation. The 737-800 has been a reliable aviation staple, but this incident has raised serious questions.

**Why It Matters**

This isn’t just an isolated event—it’s a major moment for Boeing, which is still reeling from past controversies surrounding its 737 Max series. South Korea has 101 active 737-800s across carriers like Jeju Air, Korean Air, and T’way Air, and the crash has spurred a nationwide inspection to ensure compliance with safety protocols.

Adding to the scrutiny: Jeju Air’s stock hit an all-time low following the crash, and Boeing is under pressure to uphold the reputation of its long-standing workhorse model. Aviation analysts believe investigators will closely examine bird strike standards, emergency response protocols, and why the landing gear wasn’t deployed.

**Bigger Picture:** The tragedy also lands during political upheaval in South Korea, where Acting President Choi Sang-mok has declared a week of mourning. For Boeing and South Korean aviation, this is more than a PR crisis—it’s a test of safety practices in one of the industry’s most trusted aircraft models.",12-30-2024
"Changed the way I trade and results improved dramaticallyI started trading in 2020 when the whole GME and AMC was a thing. I thought wow it is that easy to make money! I would often place risky trading ya know DIAMOND HANDS, YOLO, TO THE MOON. All I ever wanted was to get rich quick and...well things took a wrong turn. I took breaks there and here whenever I got super frustrated when I lost profits from trading options. I would gain and lose but I kept trying and was hoping to make the money back. 

Then something changed this year in Sept. I told myself I needed a new strategy and that whatever I did then was not working out for me so I decided to ditch options and just trade with shares and this is mostly from QBTS and NVIDIA as I believe in these two stocks. I kept myself discipline and worked out my errors. Swinging shares just was a better approach for me and seeing the results the past 3 months makes me feel very proud of myself. 

Do not give up, keep yourself grounded...work on your errors and eventually you'll see what strategy works well for you :)

# Nordstrom Checks Out of Wall Street

Nordstrom is saying goodbye to public markets. The founding family, with a little help from Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, has agreed to take the department store private in a $6.25 billion deal.

**Back to Basics**

The Nordstrom family isn’t new to this game. Their first attempt to take the company private in 2018 flopped, but this time, they’ve got backup. Liverpool will grab a 49.9% stake, while the family holds the majority. Shareholders will get $24.25 per share in cash—a nice premium for a stock that’s struggled to keep up with the times.

Why now? The public markets haven’t been kind. Nordstrom’s revenue never fully recovered after the pandemic, and the company has faced increasing competition from online players and discount chains.

**Private Mode: Engaged**

Taking Nordstrom private could give the company the room it needs to make changes without shareholders breathing down its neck. Department stores are no stranger to activist investors pushing for cuts, closures, and spin-offs—an escape from that pressure might be just what Nordstrom needs.

Nordstrom Rack, its off-price chain, has been one bright spot lately, recovering from past missteps. But with department stores overall in decline, even Rack’s resurgence isn’t enough to make public investors swoon.

**New Partnership, New Hope**

Liverpool, a retail heavyweight in Mexico, sees the deal as an opportunity to expand its footprint beyond Latin America. Known for running some of Mexico’s biggest department stores and franchises like Pottery Barn, Liverpool could bring a fresh perspective to Nordstrom’s playbook.

For now, the Nordstrom family is betting big on their legacy—and hoping private life gives the chain a much-needed second wind. Whether they’ll thrive or just escape the spotlight remains to be seen.

# New Year, New Fed Votes

The Federal Reserve is shaking things up in 2025, with fresh faces joining the committee that sets the country’s interest rates. And with inflation still sticking around like an unwelcome party guest, their decisions are bound to get tricky.

**Who’s In?**

This year’s rotation brings four new voters onto the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): Boston’s Susan Collins, St. Louis’s Alberto Musalem, Kansas City’s Jeff Schmid, and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee. These officials will weigh in on how fast to lower rates—a hot topic as inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target.

Outgoing members like Cleveland’s Beth Hammack have made headlines for dissenting in recent months, highlighting growing divides within the Fed. Expect more disagreements next year as policymakers tackle thorny questions about the economy.

**Slow and Steady**

Incoming members seem inclined to pump the brakes on rapid rate cuts. Musalem has already flagged concerns that inflation progress could stall, while Schmid has emphasized the need for cautious moves to avoid financial market chaos.

Collins and Goolsbee, meanwhile, lean toward gradual easing but stress that the final destination for rates remains uncertain. Goolsbee summed it up: “Inflation is way down, but rates still have a fair amount to drop over the next 12-18 months.”

**A Wild Card Year**

The backdrop for these decisions? Potentially inflation-boosting policies from the incoming Trump administration, including higher tariffs and tax cuts. Add in a labor market under pressure, and 2025 could be the Fed’s most challenging year yet.

Chair Jerome Powell, fresh off a quarter-point rate cut in December, has signaled that future moves will depend entirely on the data. Translation: Don’t expect much action at the January meeting, but buckle up for a year of debates, dissents, and careful recalibration. ",12-24-2024

Like is rsi almost ""useless"" for a stock like Nvidia that is trending like crazy? Or was it only cause of that good news today that it went up?

"Finally quitting day trading I thought the next time I would post would be to show everyone I finally broke even and made my money back. This is not the first time I quit, I quit several times through the journey but always came back. I stopped when I hit my max loss of 15k, came back after that, new max loss of 25k, still came back after that. Now I just hit 35k total loss and I’m done for good. I can’t come back now and will never since I just withdrew the remaining funds and am laying back towards the debts I owe. 
I wanted to prove all the Wendy’s employees wrong. My entire journey was only based on making back my losses and getting out at breakeven.  Starting off down a couple grand months ago it’s all been downhill. I made some big daily gains but always followed it up with much bigger losses. There are so many lessons I learned throughout my time trading and I actually thought I got the hang of it at times and could consistently make money. However, I’ve realized trading is a scam and the stock market is all BS manipulated by algorithms. 

My parents were generous enough to give me a loan to trade and I blew their money. Day trading consumed me like a gambling addict and I couldn’t eat, sleep, be happy with my wife until I made my money back.  I remember going under 25k and having PDT violations. I called up my mom again begging for money, she sent me more and I topped off my account. Week after that I went under again and now I’m asking my wife for funds she gives it to me.  I’m feeling like a drug addict at this point. Every few days I’m withdrawing money from my bank account and sending into Webull to fuel this mess. As soon as pay day arrived from work I would immediately transfer the money into my brokerage account. I know I will piss a lot of people off but I knew there was a major problem when I took out a large 401k loan against my retirement account.  I couldn’t believe it but I lost that money too in just a few weeks.  I wish I never started trading.  I loved being a day trader since it gave me dreams. It gave me the hope and chance to maybe have freedom someday and not have to work a 9-5. Or that I could make huge money and buy my family a house or gifts for my wife.  My wife doesn’t even know the extent of my losses yet.  She’s just been supportive and trusts me to do the right thing. 
I’m quitting everything now since I actually stopped day trading and tried out buying and holding stocks.  I bought AMD on a dip and if you can see how much I’ve lost on that.  It just keeps dropping and dropping and I’ve given up on that too.  
I don’t recommend anyone day trade. I wish I never learned about this I would have no debts and be such a happier person.  The reason is because most of the gains that happen on stocks are all over night.  Throughout the day the stocks would sell off and overnight jump up.  I was literally fighting to make such small dollar amounts on trades when overnight jumps were huge. If you look it up you can see that most gains happen overnight and buying throughout the day and closing before the end is just not a smart idea. 
All of you say that it’s not gambling if you have an edge.  Well screw that, if you have an edge at black jack or can count cards at poker you’re still gambling. An edge in trading realistically only game me a 50% win rate.  After considering spread between bid and ask I always end up net negative.  Furthermore level 2 data is all manipulation and bs.  So many times I saw a huge buyer at a support level and would buy right above them.  As soon as I get in the price immediately drops through that level and nothing shows on the time and sales about that buyer. Clearly they are pulling their orders.  
Sorry for going on so long but overall this game is all crap.  It’s a losing battle and I don’t recommend anyone do it.  I’ve failed my family, failed my wife, and mostly myself. It’s taken me a lot of courage to pull the plug for good.  Worst part is. If I just bought and held NVDA when I started trading 8 months ago I would have been up nearly double my account.  That sucks man. ",12-19-2024

# Honda and Nissan Might Merge to Take on the Big Dogs

Honda and Nissan—two of Japan’s auto heavyweights—are reportedly kicking the tires on a potential merger that could reshape the global car game. The alliance would create a combined force capable of challenging Toyota at home and Tesla, plus those nimble Chinese EV makers abroad.

**From Rivals to Ride-Sharers**

Talks are still in the “what if we…” phase, but reports suggest the companies could form a shared holding company. Nissan’s 24% stake in Mitsubishi means the smaller automaker might join the party too, turning this into Japan’s most significant automotive shakeup since your dad gave up his stick shift. Together, the trio could clock 8 million vehicles a year, still a few laps behind Toyota’s 11 million, but enough to put some pressure on the global leaders.

For Nissan, it’s a much-needed tow. The automaker’s operating income nosedived 90% this year amid struggles in the U.S. and China. Honda, meanwhile, has been hustling to keep its EV ambitions alive while wrestling with rising development costs. A merger could streamline production and tech investment—two essentials for staying relevant in the EV race.

**The Toyota Problem**

Toyota has been eating everyone’s lunch, pulling smaller players like Subaru, Suzuki, and Mazda under its wing to dominate the EV-hybrid market. A Honda-Nissan team-up could help level the playing field. Think shared EV batteries, consolidated R&D, and enough scale to punch back against Tesla and China’s BYD, which are sprinting ahead in electric cars.

Still, merging two fierce rivals is easier said than done. There’s overlap in their lineups, deep cultural differences, and, you know, decades of competition. As one analyst quipped, “They might share the road, but they’re not always driving in the same direction.”

**Markets Hit the Gas**

Investors love a comeback story, and Nissan’s stock surged 22% on the news, while Honda’s dipped 1.2%, as traders weighed the risk of pairing two struggling players.

If this sounds like déjà vu, that’s because Nissan’s been here before. Its long and messy relationship with France’s Renault ended in a complicated corporate divorce. Now, Nissan’s searching for a new partner to help it avoid stalling out.

**The Big Picture:** In an EV era where bigger equals better, this potential merger underscores a simple truth: carmakers need scale to survive. If Honda and Nissan can pull this off, they’d become the David to Toyota’s Goliath—a true heavyweight challenger in a market where the only real sin is being too small to matter.

# Dow’s Nine-Day Slide — Is It Really That Bad?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream “historic slump,” the story under the hood isn’t quite as dire—though it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.

**What’s Dragging the Dow Down?**

Let’s talk about the index’s biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump’s recent vow to “knock out” healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you’ve got a recipe for investor panic.

But UnitedHealth isn’t alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar—which surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending—have since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.

**Not All Markets Are Moping**

Here’s the kicker: the Dow’s funk isn’t dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech’s ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow’s quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.

In other words, the Dow’s losses aren’t a reflection of the broader market—it’s more of an index anomaly.

**So, Should You Worry?**

Here’s a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That’s not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors’ side. December’s second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.

Plus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a “pause that refreshes,” as some strategists like to say—especially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.

**The Takeaway:**The Dow’s nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let’s not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.

So breathe easy, Dow-watchers.

# Tomorrow

Sure, tomorrow we'll get some housing stats—like new builds and building permits—to gauge where the real estate supply is heading. But let's face it, the main event is the Fed.

The Federal Open Market Committee is wrapping up its last meeting of the year, and the market's betting big (over 95% odds) on another interest rate cut. But here's the kicker: this might be the final slice for a while, especially with 2025's uncertainties casting a shadow. Jerome Powell's words have been market movers all year, so tomorrow's decision feels like the grand finale in this monetary saga.

# After Market Close: 

* **Micron Technology** has been lagging behind its semiconductor peers, but investors are banking on brighter days ahead. Unlike Nvidia, Micron doesn’t make GPUs; it’s all about the memory market, where demand is expected to boom as AI continues to evolve. Wall Street hasn’t lost faith despite a sluggish year—23 out of 24 analysts still have a “buy” rating on the stock, with just one cautious “hold” in the mix. Now it’s up to Micron to prove them right. Consensus: $1.76 EPS, $8.55 billion in revenue. ($MU)",12-18-2024
"Nvidia’s price action gave me a headache. Added puts, sold a minute before it dumped. By far the most infuriating thing to ever happen.

"Stock Market Today: Drones Are Soaring on Wall Street + Bitcoin Hits $107K* The Nasdaq kicked off the final stretch of 2024 with a bang, climbing 1.2% to a fresh record close as Big Tech rallied hard. Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, and Apple all hit new highs, while the S&P 500 edged up 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Dow? It dipped 0.3%, marking its eighth straight loss—the longest losing streak since 2018.
* Investors are laser-focused on the Fed’s last meeting of the year, starting Tuesday. Hopes are high for one more rate cut to cap off 2024. While tech stocks keep stealing the spotlight, more traditional sectors are struggling to keep pace, leaving the Dow looking tired as the year winds down.

# Drones Are Soaring on Wall Street

Move over crypto and EVs, drones are the new darlings of both Wall Street and Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets. Shares of Red Cat Holdings (RCAT) skyrocketed 27% Monday after announcing a partnership with Palantir Technologies to integrate advanced visual navigation software into their drones. 

This AI-driven upgrade promises drones that don’t need GPS or radio control signals—a big win for military and government applications.

**Retail Traders Take Flight:** Red Cat isn’t just a hit with investors; it’s dominating Reddit’s meme-stock hub. The stock surged to the sixth-most popular ticker on r/WallStreetBets, gaining over 1,625% in mentions over the past 24 hours, according to Quiver Quantitative. With retail traders piling in, Red Cat’s 2024 performance is up a jaw-dropping 1,129%.

Other drone stocks also caught some tailwinds:

* **Unusual Machines** (+17.93%) got a lift from its Trump Jr. advisory board buzz. ($UMAC)
* **Kratos Defense and Security Solutions** (+5.40%) and **Aerovironment** (+7.86%) joined the rally.

**Drones Are Having a Moment:** It’s not just hype fueling the drone frenzy. Rising geopolitical tensions and an incoming Trump administration suggest increased spending on U.S.-made drones. Analysts are also bullish on federal and local governments ramping up counter-drone tech investments for public spaces like stadiums and airports.

Meanwhile, those mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey and across the Northeast have kept drones in the public eye—adding an element of intrigue (and meme potential).

**Reality Check:** While Red Cat’s stock soared during the day, after-hours trading brought turbulence. The company reported a revenue drop from $3.9 million to $1.5 million in the second quarter and widened its losses to 18 cents per share. CEO Jeff Thompson said the company paused production of its Teal 2 drones to focus on its next-gen Black Widow, prioritizing long-term growth.

**The takeaway?** Investors are betting big on drones, but as Red Cat’s mixed results show, not all growth stories take a straight path to the sky.

# Bitcoin Hits $107K: Bulls Keep the Party Going

The crypto king just smashed through $107,000, its latest *all-time high* after seven straight weeks of gains—the longest streak since 2021. Bitcoin is now up a casual 149% this year and 52% since the U.S. election. Not bad for a digital asset once pronounced dead roughly 426 times.

**Rate Cuts, Reserves, and Trump’s Crypto Cheerleading:** Today’s rally comes with a double-shot of market optimism. First, investors are nearly certain the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this week (96% chance, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool), which is music to Bitcoin’s ears. Lower rates = weaker dollar = Bitcoin-friendly environment.

Second, the crypto crowd is buzzing after Donald Trump reiterated his plan to establish a national bitcoin strategic reserve in a CNBC interview. It’s a move that feels ripped from the playbook of oil reserves but could cement Bitcoin as part of the financial infrastructure. Trump summed it up with, “We’re going to do something great with crypto.”

**MicroStrategy: All-In on Bitcoin:** If you’re looking for a Bitcoin proxy without forking over six figures for a whole coin, there’s MicroStrategy —the unofficial Bitcoin stock. Founder Michael Saylor, never one to undersell his bets, compared investing in Bitcoin today to “buying Manhattan 300 years ago.” The company doubled down on its BTC obsession, purchasing another 15,350 BTC last week, bringing its total haul to a staggering 439,000 coins worth $46 billion.

Oh, and starting Monday, MicroStrategy joins the **Nasdaq-100** index, meaning funds tracking the index will need to load up on its shares.

**The Takeaway: Hot Streak, Cautious Feet:** While the crypto market feels like a money printer right now, the pros still recommend treading carefully. Bitcoin’s price may be sky-high, but wild swings come with the territory. Whether you're HODLing or watching from the sidelines, one thing’s for sure: it’s never boring in Bitcoin-land.

# BuzzFeed’s Hot Sale: “Hot Ones” Gets a New Home

BuzzFeed just sold its crown jewel, *First We Feast*—home to the spicy celeb interview show *Hot Ones*—for $82.5 million. The buyer? A group led by Soros Fund Management, progressive media company Crooked Media, and YouTube duo Rhett and Link’s Mythical Entertainment. The deal marks a much-needed cash infusion for BuzzFeed as it battles mounting debt and declining valuation.

**Spicy Profits, Scorching Debt**  
  
While *Hot Ones* brings in about $30 million annually with its 14 million YouTube subscribers, BuzzFeed’s financial struggles have been anything but mild. Once valued at $1.5 billion, the media company is now worth around $150 million. This sale slashes BuzzFeed’s $120 million debt to $30 million, leaving it with more cash than liabilities—a small win in a tough media landscape.

Sean Evans, the host whose calm demeanor has guided celebs through fiery sauces, will stay on as Chief Creative Officer, while founder Chris Schonberger takes over as CEO. Both retain stakes in *First We Feast*, signaling the brand’s continued independence.

**BuzzFeed’s Comeback Recipe: AI?**  
  
With its debt cooling off, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti is turning up the heat on an AI-driven future. Peretti plans to lean into “tech-enabled services” and AI-powered content to reinvigorate the brand. But details remain vague, and questions linger: Will AI listicles bring the same viral charm that made BuzzFeed famous?

**Media’s Chicken Wing Moment**  
BuzzFeed isn’t alone in downsizing to survive. Legacy media giants like Vice, Vox, and even Disney-backed brands have faced layoffs or filed for bankruptcy as digital advertising wanes. Meanwhile, *Hot Ones* and other next-gen content creators are proving that niche, viral-friendly media with strong branding can still sizzle.

**The takeaway?** In a media world where old models are burning out, spicy creativity may be the secret sauce to staying relevant.

# YouTube TV Raises Prices Again

The streaming platform that once sold itself as a budget-friendly alternative to cable has inched closer to cable’s price tag. YouTube TV is hiking its monthly subscription to $83, effective January 13 for existing users, after already raising prices earlier this year.

**From Underdog to Overpriced?**  
  
Launched in 2017 at just $35 a month, YouTube TV entered the scene as a disruptor, offering live TV without the cable hassle. But over time, rising costs—mainly for live sports and programming—have pushed the price higher: $40 in 2018, $65 in 2020, and now $83. While the platform still delivers over 100 channels and unlimited DVR storage, the price tag leaves cord-cutters wondering if the “savings” pitch holds up.

**The Big Picture**  
  
YouTube TV isn’t alone in raising prices. Hulu + Live TV charges the same $83, but bundles Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu content. Sling TV starts at $40 but requires add-ons to match YouTube TV’s channel lineup. Meanwhile, cable providers are quietly looking like a relative bargain for those who don’t mind the old-school setup.

**Streaming’s Identity Crisis**  
  
When streaming began, it promised two things: affordability and simplicity. With subscription fees rivaling traditional cable bills and add-on costs for premium features like 4K streaming, the industry is testing consumers’ limits. For YouTube TV, the question becomes whether convenience—like easy cancellation and no contracts—is enough to justify its growing costs.

**The takeaway?** Cord-cutting isn’t dead, but it’s no longer the slam dunk it once was. Consumers now have to weigh whether the perks of streaming outweigh the price hikes—or if it’s time to reevaluate their subscription lineup. ",12-14-2024

# ServiceTitan Shares Soar 42% in Blockbuster IPO

The IPO drought may finally be lifting. 

ServiceTitan, a cloud software provider for home and commercial trades, made a blockbuster debut on the Nasdaq under the ticker $TTAN, with shares soaring 42% from their $71 IPO price to close at $101. 

The move gave the Glendale, California-based company a market cap of nearly $9 billion, offering a glimmer of hope for a tech IPO market that’s been in hibernation since 2021.

**From Plumbers to Public Markets**  
  
Founded in 2007 by two sons of tradesmen, ServiceTitan offers software tools to help electricians, plumbers, and landscapers manage scheduling, payments, and customer service. The company serves over 8,000 customers and generated $614 million in revenue for fiscal 2024, up 31% year-over-year, though it still operates at a net loss of $195 million.

The successful IPO reflects strong investor confidence in the company's growth potential, particularly as demand for its cloud solutions climbs. ServiceTitan’s cloud infrastructure business saw 52% year-over-year growth, cementing its position as a rising star in the tech sector.

**Navigating IPO Challenges**  
  
ServiceTitan’s road to the public markets wasn’t purely strategic—it was partially financial. A prior funding round included steep ""compounding ratchet"" terms, pushing the company to go public to avoid dilution penalties. 

he IPO raised $625 million, with a portion allocated to buy back preferred stock and pay off early investors. Despite the urgency, the IPO’s reception suggests strong market enthusiasm, with retail investors driving early gains.

**What’s Next for IPOs?**  
  
ServiceTitan’s debut isn’t just a win for its founders or venture backers like ICONIQ Growth and Bessemer Venture Partners—it’s a potential green light for other fintech and tech startups waiting in the wings. Analysts see the IPO as a sign that investor appetite for high-growth tech stocks is returning, even amid tighter monetary conditions.

For ServiceTitan, the next chapter includes leveraging its IPO proceeds to fuel growth, pursue acquisitions, and edge closer to profitability. As co-founder and CEO Ara Mahdessian noted, “Investors value durable growth and cash flow positivity—qualities we’re proud to deliver.”

With the Nasdaq Composite closing at record highs and tech giants thriving, ServiceTitan’s IPO success might just be the spark needed to reopen the IPO floodgates.

# Echelon Of Earnings

**⚡️Broadcom Powers Up on AI Hype:** Broadcom’s latest earnings call was an AI lovefest, with the chipmaker reporting a jaw-dropping 220% surge in AI chip revenue, hitting $12.2 billion for the fiscal year. CEO Hock Tan wasn’t shy about the company’s future, forecasting a $90 billion addressable market for AI components by 2027. While the broader semiconductor business is feeling a bit sluggish, AI is doing the heavy lifting.   
  
In Q4 alone, total sales reached nearly $14.1 billion, driven by the booming demand for AI processors and networking chips. Investors cheered, sending the stock up 14% in after-hours trading. Broadcom’s secret sauce? Two new hyperscaler clients and a growing AI infrastructure footprint that keeps it in the same conversation as Nvidia. ($AVGO)

**🤘🏼 Costco Keeps Rolling Despite Consumer Caution:** Turns out, bulk-size everything is recession-proof. Costco smashed Wall Street’s expectations with a $4.04 per share profit last quarter, thanks to its die-hard member base and a strong showing from both food and discretionary sales. Same-store sales jumped 7.1%, and online sales played a starring role in the retailer’s continued growth.   
  
Even as inflation forces some retailers to fight for scraps, Costco’s Kirkland brand and jumbo-sized deals are still luring customers through the doors. Seasonal items like furniture and jewelry are flying off the shelves, while food and groceries continue to edge out dining out. Investors liked what they saw—Costco’s stock is up 50% year-to-date, with no signs of slowing down. ($COST)

🥊 **Adobe Faces the AI Critics:** Adobe is finding out that even being a generative AI pioneer doesn’t guarantee smooth sailing. The company’s FY2025 guidance sent shares tumbling 13%, marking its worst day in two years. While Q4 results—$5.61 billion in revenue and $4.81 per share in profit—beat analyst estimates, the future is less certain. Investors are jittery over competition from AI startups like OpenAI, which are encroaching on Adobe’s turf with creative tools that could siphon market share.   
  
Adobe isn’t sitting still, though. Its AI tool, Firefly, has been integrated across key products like Photoshop and Premiere, logging a whopping 16 billion uses. Executives are betting on a new, higher-priced Firefly tier to boost margins in 2025. But Wall Street’s patience is running thin, with many still questioning whether Adobe can defend its position in an AI-driven world. ($ADBE)

# Amazon Adds 'Car Shopping' to Its Cart

Amazon is taking your online shopping spree to a whole new level—cars. 

The retail behemoth just launched *Amazon Autos*, letting you shop for a Hyundai like you would for an air fryer. Except instead of a Prime box at your door, you’ll pick it up at a dealership.

**The Details: Click, Scroll, Drive**  
  
Amazon Autos is debuting in 48 U.S. cities with Hyundai as its exclusive partner. Buyers can browse new models, customize trims and colors, estimate trade-in values, secure financing, and e-sign paperwork—all on Amazon’s platform. What you won’t get? Free two-day delivery. You’ll still have to visit the dealership to drive off in your new ride.

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is throwing in a $2,300 gift card for purchases made before January 10. Think of it as gas money, or, knowing Amazon, a chance to stock up on Alexa devices for your car.

**Why It Matters: Bye-Bye, Dealership Drama?**  
  
Car buying is infamous for its soul-draining haggling. Amazon promises to take that headache out of the equation by showing transparent, haggle-free pricing at checkout—taxes and fees included. Unlike Tesla’s direct-to-consumer model, Amazon keeps dealerships in the mix, playing the ultimate middleman. Hyundai dealers sell the cars; Amazon makes the process easier (or so they claim).  
  
Here’s the fine print: Amazon Autos is only offering new Hyundai vehicles—no used cars, no other brands (yet). Leasing and more expansive financing options are expected to roll out next year. Still, Amazon is clearly testing the waters, setting itself up as the one-click king of car buying.

**Bigger Picture: A New Gear for E-Commerce**  
  
This move isn’t just about Hyundai. It’s a clear sign Amazon is eyeing the future of car shopping, where the experience is more app-friendly than awkward-salesperson-at-a-dealership. Rivals like Carvana and CarMax should take note.

If Amazon pulls this off, imagine adding a car to your cart alongside your groceries.

Slated for mass production by 2026, this custom silicon marks Apple’s latest move to reduce its reliance on Nvidia’s chips while carving out a space in the lucrative AI hardware race.

**Broadcom’s Boost**  
  
Broadcom shares climbed 5% on the news, reflecting the market’s enthusiasm for this partnership. Apple and Broadcom are reportedly prioritizing the chip's networking technology—a critical piece for handling the high demands of AI processing in the cloud. Apple is expected to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSMC) cutting-edge N3P process for *Baltra*.

This isn’t Apple’s first foray into chip design. The tech giant has successfully replaced Intel in its MacBooks with its in-house M-series processors, and now it’s channeling that expertise into server hardware to support AI applications.

**Catching Up in AI**  
  
While Apple has been slow to roll out generative AI compared to its Big Tech rivals, it’s starting to show signs of catching up. Recent *Apple Intelligence* features, including integrations for Siri and Maps, aim to leverage AI directly on devices. But for more compute-heavy tasks, Apple’s cloud infrastructure needs a serious upgrade—which is where *Baltra*comes in.

**Broadcom’s Winning Streak**  
  
Broadcom has become a top beneficiary of the generative AI boom, with shares up 54% this year following a massive rally in 2023. The company’s role in Apple’s AI chip ambitions further solidifies its standing in a market that could grow to $45 billion by 2028.

While Apple’s efforts won’t dethrone Nvidia anytime soon, the company’s pivot toward in-house AI hardware signals a strategic move to future-proof its ecosystem—and ensure Siri doesn’t get left in the dust.

# Tomorrow

The Producer Price Index (PPI) steps into the inflation spotlight next, offering a look at how prices are trending for the companies behind the goods and services we consume. While the CPI tracks costs for consumers, PPI is a wholesale measure of inflation that provides critical insights into the broader economic picture, even if it doesn’t get as much buzz.

In October, PPI remained flat month-over-month and rose 1.8% year-over-year. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, jumped 2.8%. Economists are watching closely for November’s reading, expecting a slight moderation to 2.5% annually. Meanwhile, the Fed’s other priority—employment—gets a check-in tomorrow with jobless claims data. Last week’s claims rose by 9,000 to 224,000, slightly above expectations but still below historical averages, and forecasts call for 221,000 new claims this week.

# After Market Close:

* **Broadcom** is doubling down on AI, and it’s paying off. While the chipmaker stumbled earlier this year with VMware tech, its last earnings report showed strong top- and bottom-line growth, putting those issues firmly in the rearview. Wall Street is bullish—12 of 14 analysts rate it a “buy,” with a price target 16% above current levels. Consensus: $1.39 EPS, $14.09 billion in revenue. ($AVGO)
* **Costco** isn’t just about bulk deals—it’s become a lifestyle choice, especially as inflation drives up grocery bills. The company has thrived in this environment, but with shares at all-time highs, valuation concerns are creeping in. Even with its rock-solid business model, investors are questioning how much higher it can go. Consensus: $3.86 EPS, $62.16 billion in revenue. ($COST) ",12-11-2024

# China Opens Probe Into Nvidia, Adding Heat to Global Tech War

Nvidia just found itself in Beijing’s crosshairs.

Chinese regulators launched an antitrust probe into the U.S. chip giant over its $7 billion Mellanox acquisition from 2020. The investigation centers on whether Nvidia violated conditions set at the time of the deal, like ensuring fair treatment of Chinese firms. Shares of the chipmaker dipped 2.55% on the news, a minor dent considering the company’s meteoric 188% rise this year.

**Escalation in a Global AI Arms Race**

This isn’t just about chips; it’s the latest salvo in the U.S.-China tech cold war. The Biden administration’s export bans on advanced AI chips, including those from Nvidia, aim to curb China’s military and tech ambitions. 

Meanwhile, China’s response includes restricting exports of key raw materials and now flexing its regulatory muscle on Nvidia. Adding to the tension, President-elect Trump has promised steep tariffs on Chinese goods, potentially deepening the rift.

**Nvidia’s Global Scrutiny**

China isn’t the only one with questions about Nvidia’s dominance. U.S. and European regulators have also probed the chipmaker for antitrust violations in the past year, focusing on whether it’s leveraging its market power to unfairly edge out competition. 

While these cases often take years to resolve, they underline the risks of being the top player in the AI chip market—a sector critical for everything from large language models to military tech.

**The Bigger Picture**

Despite the regulatory clouds, Nvidia remains an investor favorite, riding high on AI’s explosive growth. But the ongoing scrutiny shows how geopolitical tensions and regulatory backlash can weigh even on the most successful players. For Nvidia, this could be a long game of managing compliance while staying ahead of rivals in the AI arms race.

The takeaway? Nvidia’s dominance might still be intact, but the scrutiny underscores how its position at the heart of the U.S.-China tech battle is both an asset and a liability.

# Mondelez Takes Another Bite at Hershey

Oreo and Ritz powerhouse Mondelez International has rekindled its interest in acquiring Hershey, the maker of Reese’s and Kisses, in a deal that could create a global snacks behemoth with $50 billion in combined sales. 

Hershey shares surged over 10% following the news, marking their best day since Mondelez’s first takeover attempt in 2016. Back then, Hershey rejected a $23 billion bid, and Mondelez walked away.

**Sweet Opportunity or Sticky Situation?**

Mondelez’s approach comes amid challenges for Hershey, including record-high cocoa prices and competition from health-conscious trends like GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. While Hershey’s iconic chocolate brands remain household names, the company recently lowered its sales outlook, citing inflation-weary consumers. 

The Hershey Trust, which holds 80% of the company’s voting stock, remains a key player in any potential deal. Its approval is essential, and history suggests they’re not easily swayed.

**The Stakes Are High**

This deal wouldn’t just be about chocolate. It’s a response to broader pressures in the packaged food sector, where companies are seeking mergers to combat slowing growth and rising costs. Mondelez, whose portfolio includes Toblerone and Cadbury, is no stranger to M&A and sees Hershey as a gateway to bolstering its North American dominance while expanding into new global markets.

But there’s a bitter side. Pennsylvania law could allow the state attorney general to step in if the Hershey Trust loses significant power, a hurdle that has derailed past attempts to acquire the chocolate maker. And let’s not forget the Federal Trade Commission, which might scrutinize such a large deal in today’s antitrust-focused climate.

**Takeaway:** A Mondelez-Hershey merger could redefine the global snack landscape, but it’s far from a done deal. With regulatory hurdles and Hershey’s storied independence at play, the outcome might hinge on whether Mondelez can sweeten its offer enough to satisfy both the Hershey Trust and cautious regulators.

"Trying to understand the market on a deeper level, a few questions:Hello, I'm new to trading and I want to learn the stockmarket on a deeper level. I have a couple of questions I would love to have answered. Also, I would greatly appreciate references to articles or tips on any further reading.

1. Does stock expensiveness affect stock performance. For example, will a stock valued at 10$ behave differently than a stock valued at 100$ given that they're traded at similar rates. I understand that in general there may be more growth potential for the cheaper stock, but are there any other differences? 

2. How accurate are indicators? Things like RSI and ATX, I understand that these are applicable in some circumstances, but in general, how useful are they? Also, as far as I understand these measurements are quite old, do they still hold up, if not, are there any indicators that people use more frequently today?

  
3. My understanding of economy is pretty basic - basically supply demand. However, it feels like demand can be manipulated by certain factors suchs as group-think. For example, I hear Nvidia and Tesla are overvalued but they are still expensive on the market, presumably because of trader psychology. Following this logic - is trading of stocks based of ""vibes"" profitable as long as you know to sell before the burst?

4. For swing-trading, is it preferable to learn everything about companies in a specific sector, or is a more diverse understanding of macro-economics and geopolitics preferable?

# Lululemon’s Comeback Stretch, Biggest Surge Since 2008

Lululemon just turned heads—not with yoga pants, but with its Q3 earnings. 

The stock leapt 16% on Friday, its biggest single-day surge since 2018. While it’s still down 22% for the year (compared to the S&P 500’s 28% gain), the strong quarter has investors hoping the brand’s mojo is back.

**A Stitch Above Expectations**  
  
The numbers don’t lie: Lululemon clocked $2.4 billion in revenue, a 9% year-over-year jump, and earnings per share of $2.87—well above Wall Street’s $2.69 expectations. 

And for an encore, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook to as high as $10.49 billion. CEO Calvin McDonald credited the bounce-back to international growth and fresh product tweaks, like looser fits and seasonal colors.  
  
While U.S. sales dipped 2%, Lululemon found its footing abroad with international sales climbing 25%. China stole the spotlight, delivering a whopping 39% growth. 

The retailer’s strategic plan to hit $12.5 billion in annual revenue by 2026 seems less of a stretch now, thanks to its focus on men’s gear, global markets, and expanded e-commerce.

**The Takeaway:** Lululemon proved it can still flex in a crowded athleisure market, but challenges remain. U.S. consumers are feeling the pinch, and rivals are churning out leggings at lower prices. For now, the brand is balancing its domestic hurdles with international gains, showing it might just be the comeback kid Wall Street didn’t see coming.

Chrysler’s struggles are just one piece of the chaos at Stellantis, its parent company. Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, and Ram too, but it’s having a rough year. U.S. sales nosedived 20% last quarter, and its stock has tanked 40% year-to-date.

The company's average car price hovers near $55,000—making it a tough sell for price-sensitive buyers. Even after lowering prices, Stellantis has been bleeding market share and goodwill.

**Tariffs Could Break the Minivan**

Adding insult to injury, President-elect Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on Canadian imports could put the final nail in the Pacifica’s coffin. Built in Ontario, the minivan could become wildly expensive—or unprofitable to produce. 

Chrysler’s response? A reboot of the lower-cost Voyager minivan next year. It’s a bold move for a dying category, but it might just buy the brand some time.

Here’s the kicker: Chrysler’s dealerships also sell Jeep, Dodge, and Ram vehicles, making a shutdown relatively painless for Stellantis. Analysts expect the incoming Stellantis CEO to start with a full brand audit—and with only one fading minivan to its name, Chrysler’s place on the roster looks shaky.

**The Bottom Line:** Chrysler went from an industry titan to a brand with one lonely minivan struggling to stay afloat. With SUV-loving consumers, mounting tariffs, and Stellantis in turmoil, Chrysler’s survival will depend on a near-miraculous turnaround—or it could join Pontiac and Plymouth in the automotive graveyard.

Things are cooling down on the economic front, but there are still a few noteworthy reports to watch. Tuesday kicks off with the Small Business Optimism Index, while inflation takes center stage midweek with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropping Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday. These inflation reports are the final clues the Fed will have before its two-day meeting starting December 17, where it’ll decide whether to deliver a parting rate cut for the year.

EARNINGS

SNPS review

* Synopsys ad a beat-beat with record earnings but Wall Street couldn’t figure out the guide, where there was an extra work week in Q124 that won't be there in Q125. SO the miss on guide is no big deal. It's unfairly down  I appreciated the design win conversations around design wins and PCIe6, CXL3, UCIe, ADAS, and 800gig demos. Read the full transcript it’s fascinating. The future is design by companies like Synopsys.   Good details on its alignment with ARM.  Ansys looks like a done deal with a few minor hurdles to go. This is such a huge opportunity given the need to meld micro with macro design. AI adds an accelerant to both.   Company looks to be taking a conservative and prudent approach to China given the uncertainty.

S - underwhelming quarter. should have seen a number of tailwinds with CRWD outage but they didnt really materialise for them this quarter. Not awful, but I expected more and likely most of the market did.

# Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger Out

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is stepping down, but not on his own terms. 

The board effectively pushed him out after frustrations over slow progress in regaining Intel’s footing in the semiconductor race. CFO David Zinsner and products leader Michelle Johnston Holthaus will serve as interim co-CEOs while the search for a permanent replacement begins.

Gelsinger’s tenure, which began in 2021, was marked by ambitious goals to revamp Intel’s manufacturing and compete with global leaders like Nvidia and TSMC. But his high-cost turnaround strategy failed to deliver results quickly enough for the board or investors. Shares have plummeted 61% during his tenure, and the company continues to face setbacks in both revenue and innovation.

**Stuck in the Chips Slow Lane**

Intel’s struggles go beyond Gelsinger. The company has long lagged behind in advanced chip production and missed opportunities in the AI boom—an area now dominated by Nvidia. Efforts to expand into foundry services, manufacturing chips for other companies, drained cash reserves without attracting major clients. Meanwhile, competitors gained market share in lucrative AI and data center sectors.

The board’s frustration reportedly came to a head over the lack of compelling products and the slow pace of Intel’s transformation into a contract chip manufacturer. While Gelsinger advocated for staying the course, the board decided it was time for a change, signaling potential strategic pivots ahead.

**A Tall Order for the Next CEO**

Whoever takes the reins will inherit a daunting task. Intel faces mounting challenges: catching up in AI chips, competing with better-funded rivals, and balancing a capital-intensive foundry business with waning investor confidence. The company also has $50 billion in debt, a stark contrast to its cash-rich days of dominating the semiconductor market.

Some analysts suggest Intel may need to spin off its foundry division to focus on core chip design, while others predict deeper cost cuts. Either way, the new CEO will need to act decisively to stabilize the business—and fast. As Intel grapples with its place in a rapidly changing industry, the stakes have never been higher.

# Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated

Elon Musk’s record $56 billion Tesla pay package has hit another roadblock. A Delaware judge upheld her earlier ruling voiding the 2018 compensation plan, despite a recent shareholder vote attempting to reinstate it. Judge Kathaleen McCormick criticized Tesla’s board for its lack of independence in approving the deal, citing undue influence from Musk.

The package, originally worth $2.6 billion and ballooning to $101.5 billion by today’s share prices, was the largest in U.S. corporate history. With the court’s decision, Tesla shareholders have effectively slashed Musk’s prospective payout—though his existing wealth, buoyed by Tesla’s stock rally, keeps him securely at the top of the billionaire leaderboard.

**Shareholders Step In, Court Stands Firm**

Tesla had hoped a June shareholder vote to ratify the pay plan would override McCormick’s concerns, but the judge wasn’t swayed. McCormick called the vote legally ineffective, refusing to accept what she termed “new facts” created to revise prior rulings. Tesla’s board now faces a dilemma: how to keep Musk incentivized without igniting further shareholder backlash or legal trouble.

In addition to voiding the pay plan, McCormick approved $345 million in attorney fees for the plaintiff’s legal team—a fraction of their initial $5.6 billion request but still among the highest awards in U.S. litigation history. Musk’s legal team has 30 days to decide whether to appeal.

**Bigger Battles Ahead**

This setback isn’t likely to slow Musk down. Tesla stock has surged 42% since Donald Trump’s election win, fueled by expectations that Musk’s ties to the incoming administration will yield business-friendly policies. However, with Tesla’s incorporation recently shifted to Texas and the legal dispute unresolved, uncertainty looms.

Musk’s influence over Tesla’s board and shareholder dynamics continues to draw scrutiny, and any new compensation plan will likely face similar challenges. Meanwhile, the billionaire’s ventures in AI, electric vehicles, and space exploration keep him at the forefront of industry and political intrigue—whether or not his paychecks match his ambitions.

# Amazon Throws Another $4 Billion into the AI Ring

Amazon is going all-in on artificial intelligence, tossing an additional $4 billion into Anthropic’s war chest. 

This San Francisco-based AI upstart, known for its Claude chatbot, has already secured $8 billion in Amazon investments—making it clear the tech giant wants a piece of the AI action. And the partnership isn’t just about cash. Anthropic is doubling down on AWS as its primary cloud provider, fully embracing Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia chips to supercharge its AI ambitions.

This investment positions Amazon as a heavyweight in the generative AI arms race, where Anthropic competes head-to-head with OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. 

As Claude gains traction in industries like finance and healthcare, Amazon is banking on Anthropic to help boost its AI credentials while offering businesses tailored AI solutions through AWS.

# Claude Gets a Cloud Boost

AWS isn’t just hosting Anthropic’s AI models; it’s adding exclusive perks to woo enterprise clients. For instance, AWS customers will soon get early access to a new Anthropic feature allowing them to fine-tune AI models using their own data. This unique offering sets AWS apart in a crowded cloud market and ensures Amazon gets a return on its massive investment.

Meanwhile, Anthropic has been busy leveling up Claude. Recent updates allow the AI assistant to perform human-like tasks on computers—think navigating websites and managing complex workflows. Add to that the launch of Claude Enterprise, and it’s clear Anthropic is aiming to dominate the AI-for-business space.

# AI’s Billion-Dollar Boom

Amazon’s big bet underscores the sheer scale of AI’s financial demands. Anthropic’s CEO predicts the cost of developing next-gen models could hit $100 billion in the near future—a steep climb from this year’s $100 million. But with the generative AI market expected to rake in $1 trillion within a decade, it’s a gamble Amazon is willing to take.

Still, not everyone’s cheering. Regulators are increasingly wary of tech giants gobbling up the AI market, with U.S. officials scrutinizing deals like this for potential anti-competitive behavior. 

But for Amazon, the playbook is clear: dominate AI, bolster AWS, and make sure it’s the cloud behind all the big brains of tomorrow.

# Gap Jumps After Lifting Outlook Ahead of Key Shopping Season

Gap Inc. is on a roll. Shares of the retail giant jumped 12% today after it raised its full-year outlook, marking a strong start to the all-important holiday shopping season. 

The company’s fiscal Q3 results outperformed Wall Street’s expectations, with earnings per share hitting $0.72 compared to the forecasted $0.58 and revenue climbing 2% to $3.83 billion. CEO Richard Dickson, who took the reins in 2023, credited the company’s turnaround to stronger brand identities, better pricing strategies, and nostalgic marketing campaigns.

Despite challenges like unseasonably warm weather and hurricanes that temporarily closed 180 stores, Gap’s holiday season is already looking promising. Dickson emphasized the company’s improved execution and momentum compared to a year ago, stating, “Our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year.”

# Breaking Down the Brand Performance

Gap’s eponymous brand saw a 3% increase in comparable sales, boosted by improved marketing and product offerings. Meanwhile, Old Navy, its largest revenue generator, posted flat comparable sales, slightly missing analysts’ expectations. 

Warmer weather impacted kids’ outerwear sales, but Dickson noted a rebound as conditions normalized. Banana Republic, the trendy workwear line, reported a 2% rise in sales but struggled with a 1% drop in comparable sales, reflecting ongoing efforts to refine its fundamentals.

Athleta, Gap’s athleisure brand, stood out with a 4% sales increase and a 5% boost in comparable sales, signaling a recovery under new leadership. The turnaround is particularly notable given last year’s 19% drop in comparable sales for the brand.

# Gearing Up for the Holidays

With four consecutive quarters of sales growth, Gap is banking on a strong holiday season to sustain its momentum. The company has raised its full-year guidance, now projecting sales growth of 1.5% to 2%—far above analysts’ expectations of 0.4%. Operating income forecasts were also bumped up, signaling confidence in profitability.

Looking ahead, Dickson’s strategy of leveraging nostalgia and celebrity partnerships seems to be paying off. While the company still faces challenges, particularly in product assortment and full-price selling, Gap’s recent performance shows it’s heading in the right direction. 

Investors and holiday shoppers alike will be watching closely to see if the comeback story continues.

# Next Week

Next week is a quick one, thanks to Thanksgiving shutting down markets on Thursday and trimming Friday’s trading to a half day. With only a few reports to track, the action is packed into just two trading days.

Tuesday brings real estate updates like the S&P Case-Shiller home price index and new home sales, alongside a snapshot of consumer confidence. On Wednesday, brace for a flood of data: initial jobless claims, durable goods orders, a GDP revision, and the main event—PCE inflation.

Earnings are similarly crammed into two days:

* **Monday**: Bath & Body Works ($BBWI), Zoom ($ZM), and Agilent Technologies ($A).
* **Tuesday**: Best Buy ($BBY), HP ($HPQ), Dell Technologies ($DELL), CrowdStrike ($CRWD), Analog Devices ($ADI), Abercrombie & Fitch ($ANF), Macy’s ($M), Burlington Stores ($BURL), Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Kohl’s ($KSS), and Manchester United ($MANU).

After that, it’s all turkey, touchdowns, and terriers in the Thanksgiving home stretch. ",11-23-2024

# MicroStrategy Tumbles After Citron Research Shorts the Stock

MicroStrategy’s stock nosedived 16% Thursday, courtesy of a scathing call from Andrew Left’s Citron Research. 

The once high-flying software-turned-Bitcoin hoarder got a cold shower as Citron accused it of floating far above Bitcoin fundamentals. The kicker? Citron is still bullish on Bitcoin but says MicroStrategy’s stock has become a clunky detour in a world of sleek Bitcoin ETFs.

Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin gamble turned MicroStrategy into the unofficial crypto ETF by amassing a jaw-dropping 331,200 bitcoins—worth over $31 billion. But with Bitcoin ETFs now making crypto exposure as simple as shopping on Amazon, investors might wonder if MicroStrategy’s stock is still worth the extra clicks.

# From Darling to Short Target: A Citron Twist

Here’s the irony: Citron used to be one of MicroStrategy’s loudest cheerleaders during its pivot to Bitcoin back in 2020. Fast forward to today, and Citron’s short position is a sharp reality check for Saylor’s strategy. 

Their main gripe? The stock’s value seems more like a speculative joyride than a sustainable business play.

Even with Bitcoin hitting a record $98,000, MicroStrategy’s reliance on hype over fundamentals has some investors tapping the brakes. Thursday’s tumble brought the company’s market cap back down to $89 billion—still hefty but a far cry from its momentary seat among the S&P 500’s big shots.

# Bitcoin Boom, But at What Cost?

Sure, MicroStrategy is still up over 500% this year—thanks, Bitcoin—but that kind of surge has its skeptics. Kerrisdale Capital made a similar call earlier, shorting MicroStrategy while betting long on Bitcoin. 

Their reasoning? You don’t need to ride the Saylor train when Bitcoin ETFs offer first-class seats.

Meanwhile, crypto miners like CleanSpark and Marathon Digital are picking up steam as alternative plays for Bitcoin exposure. And with President-elect Trump eyeing U.S.-only Bitcoin mining, the competition could heat up further.

# Comcast Spins Off Cable Networks

Comcast is putting most of its cable networks into their own sandbox, spinning them off into a new publicly traded entity called SpinCo. 

The move allows NBCUniversal to focus on its shinier toys—like streaming, theme parks, and entertainment—while cord-cutting continues to gnaw at the profitability of traditional TV. This strategic reshuffle sets the stage for a more streamlined Comcast, primed to compete in high-growth areas.

# Cable Castaways: What’s In and What’s Out

SpinCo will house networks like USA, MSNBC, CNBC, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and Golf Channel, as well as digital properties like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. These assets brought in $7 billion over the past year but are increasingly seen as anchors in a sinking industry. 

Bravo and Peacock, however, are staying put. Why? They’re integral to NBCUniversal’s growth story, with Peacock recently flexing its muscles via Olympics coverage and an 82% revenue surge last quarter.

Leadership for SpinCo is already lined up, with NBCU veteran Mark Lazarus taking the CEO reins and Anand Kini serving as CFO and COO. The new venture is being touted as ""well-capitalized"" and ripe for partnerships—or maybe a few mergers, given the Trump administration's expected M&A-friendly stance.

# A Play for Growth, Not Nostalgia

The spin-off underscores the brutal math of the modern media landscape. Cable TV, while still profitable, lacks growth potential. Comcast’s move mirrors a broader industry shift, as rivals like Disney and Warner Bros. 

Discovery weigh similar strategies but haven’t yet pulled the trigger. Meanwhile, Comcast is all-in on its forward-facing ventures, such as Peacock, which now boasts 29% more paid subscribers and is nearing profitability.

NBCUniversal isn’t just banking on streaming. Its theme park arm is preparing to debut Epic Universe in Orlando, described as the most advanced park yet. Translation: It’s full steam ahead for investments in experiences people can’t stream from their couches.

# The Big Picture: Spin Now, Merge Later?

SpinCo won’t be left to fend for itself indefinitely. Comcast hinted at future acquisitions or partnerships to build scale in a fragmented cable market. With 70 million U.S. households still paying for cable, there’s value in consolidation—even if the long-term trajectory remains bleak.

For Comcast, this isn’t just about cutting loose legacy assets. It’s about unburdening its core business to take bigger swings in streaming and entertainment. As Peacock and Epic Universe gain momentum, the SpinCo experiment will test whether old-school cable can thrive—or merely survive—when left to its own devices.

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is wrapping up, with only a few notable reports left to trickle in next week. Tomorrow, though? It’s looking pretty quiet on the corporate front.

Instead, all eyes will be on two economic reports: Services and Manufacturing PMI. The PMI, a monthly pulse check on U.S. businesses, surveys companies about production, inventories, and overall conditions to gauge economic health.

The services sector has been on a roll, hitting 56% last month (anything above 50% signals growth) and marking its best showing since July 2022. Manufacturing? Not so much. With a 46.5% reading, it’s stuck in a seven-month losing streak. While rate cuts could eventually revive the sector, economists are still waiting for the tide to turn.",11-21-2024
"trying to learn and find a long term strategyHi,

i have been watching the stock market since 2015 but I didn't really invest in the market because i wasn't experienced and was afraid of the risks, so I kinda missed a lot of opportunities, i could have bought anything and made over a million if i just held it for 10 years.

now I'm trying to start day trading and trying to make consistent monthly profit. i started last month by buying and selling nvidia and I made around 9% profit i was hoping to make 1% profit daily so 20% but it seems i need a lot more time in market and I'm limited by IBKR cash account and T+1.

I'm trying to buy only stocks that are part of S&P500 since i could hold it longer if it dipped and recover. but i want to find something more volatile and i want to be able to rebuy immediately without waiting for buying power, should i switch to crypto or forex to try to make 20% monthly? or should i just keep doing what I'm doing and try to make 6-10% consistently monthly?

i don't want to buy options/future or to use margin account because that's a lot of risk for what I'm trying to achieve.

what do you recommend for easy guaranteed profit (10-20% monthly) and low risk something that could be repeated (stocks/crypto/forex).

# Nvidia’s AI Crown Is Getting Heavier

Nvidia’s AI-fueled rocket ship is still flying high—but signs of turbulence are emerging. 

The chip kingpin posted a 94% revenue surge to $35.1 billion last quarter, with profits nearly doubling to $19.3 billion. It also projected $37.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter, fueled by Blackwell, its latest AI chip that’s as coveted as a golden ticket to Willy Wonka’s factory.

The results are a testament to Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips, which remain the go-to choice for companies scaling up their AI capabilities. But after several quarters of jaw-dropping growth, some investors are wondering if Nvidia’s star is starting to dim.

**Chipping In Everywhere**

Nvidia’s data center division—the heart of its AI boom—brought in $30.8 billion, a 112% jump. Blackwell chips are already powering big names like Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI, though demand is expected to outweigh supply well into 2026.

The gaming segment didn’t sit idle either, contributing $3.28 billion, driven by GPUs and Nintendo Switch console chips. Even the smaller automotive division revved up, with a 72% sales increase thanks to its self-driving car tech and robotics chips.

Nvidia’s AI dominance is also opening new doors, from drug discovery to sovereign AI investments—markets that could add billions in the coming years.

**Clouds Over Sunny Skies**

Despite the blockbuster numbers, Nvidia’s stock slipped 2% in after-hours trading. Why? Growth is slowing—albeit from sky-high levels—and competition is heating up. Rivals like AMD are sniffing around, while tech giants like Amazon and Google are building their own chips to cut reliance on Nvidia. 

Meanwhile, regulators in the U.S. and Europe are eyeing Nvidia’s more-than-80% share of the AI chip market, raising concerns about monopolistic practices. Add to that some engineering hiccups with Blackwell’s rollout, and the once-smooth journey has hit a few bumps.

**The AI Marathon**

For now, Nvidia’s dominance is unquestionable, but sustaining its meteoric rise won’t be easy. CEO Jensen Huang, who’s gone from chip visionary to tech icon, knows the AI race is a marathon, not a sprint. 

As Nvidia eyes opportunities in AI-powered robotics, national AI initiatives, and next-gen chips, the stakes have never been higher. 

While Huang works to outpace competitors and placate regulators, one thing is clear: the race to stay on top will be just as intense as the rise to get there.

# Target Shares Tumble on Earnings Miss

Target’s turnaround plans are feeling more like a Target cart with a wonky wheel. 

Shares nosedived 21% on Wednesday after the retailer reported disappointing quarterly results and slashed its profit outlook. Shoppers are skipping the nonessentials—like that one decorative throw pillow you didn’t need anyway—and Target’s attempts to avoid supply chain issues backfired, leaving it with bloated inventories. 

Meanwhile, Walmart’s stellar quarter only underscored Target’s struggles, making CEO Brian Cornell’s job of reviving the brand look even tougher.

**Walmart’s Got the Juice**

If Target’s struggling, Walmart’s thriving. The retail titan notched a 5.3% jump in U.S. comparable sales, boosted by growth in groceries and discretionary items like clothing. 

Costco is also flexing, with strong sales in jewelry and home goods. The key difference? Walmart is cleaning up by appealing to inflation-weary shoppers looking for low prices, while Target’s higher costs and focus on discretionary goods are scaring off budget-conscious buyers. In the battle for retail dominance, Walmart is leaving Target in the dust.

**Too Little, Too Late?**

Target’s efforts to recover—like price cuts on essentials and expanding private-label brands—aren’t landing as planned. Sure, there were some bright spots: foot traffic rose 2.4% and beauty sales sparkled, but overall, it wasn’t enough to counter sluggish demand for big-ticket items. 

Add to that a holiday season overshadowed by cautious consumers, and you’ve got analysts downgrading the stock faster than shoppers heading to Walmart’s aisles.

**What’s the Play Now?**

Cornell says Target is gearing up for the holidays, banking on stocked shelves and competitive pricing to woo customers. But with discretionary spending in the slump and whispers of tariffs under a new administration, the road to recovery looks bumpy at best.

If Target wants to win back shoppers, it’ll need more than discounts—it’ll need a hit that even Walmart can’t beat.

# Tomorrow

Buckle up—tomorrow’s data dump is packed.

First, we’ll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there’s the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don’t get too excited—tomorrow’s forecast calls for a big ol’ zero in growth.

This development has likely raised some eyebrows among shareholders, who’ll be eager to hear how the company plans to counter the looming threat.

# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers

Walmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. 

The retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.

**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  
  
Interestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. 

Shoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.

**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. 

Walmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.

**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s ""everyday low prices"" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.

Still, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.

# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid

Qualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. 

The chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.

**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  
  
Qualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.

Other promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.

**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  
  
While Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. 

Executives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.

**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. 

However, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.

No major economic data is dropping tomorrow, but keep an ear out for a few Federal Reserve governors speaking at various events—including Michelle Bowman, a name you might remember.

Though she sided with the crew this month on a 25-basis-point cut, Bowman’s willingness to go against the grain makes her remarks tomorrow something to watch.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Target** may be a household favorite, but even fan favorites feel the squeeze. Earlier this year, the retailer slashed prices on thousands of products to entice budget-conscious shoppers—and they’re gearing up to do it again for the holiday season. Despite the markdown marathon, Target’s bottom line has stayed relatively steady, and analysts expect the previous quarter to hold up well. Still, shareholders are likely asking the big question: When does the discounting spree end? For now, the consensus calls for $2.30 EPS on $25.96 billion in revenue. ($TGT)

# After Market Close: 

* **Nvidia** continues to play the MVP role in the stock market. Its Magnificent 7 counterparts delivered solid earnings this quarter, and all eyes are on whether the chip titan—up nearly 190% this year—has more fuel in the tank. For those fearing they’re late to the AI boom, analysts are betting there’s plenty of runway left. With AI demand showing no signs of cooling, Nvidia remains the undisputed king of the semiconductor hill. Consensus estimates peg earnings at $0.74 per share on $32.86 billion in revenue.

# Tesla Stock Pops After Report Trump Wants To Relax U.S. Self-Driving Rules

Tesla stock zoomed over 5% on Monday after news broke that Trump’s transition team is hitting the gas pedal on federal self-driving car regulations. 

For Musk, this feels like a scripted Hollywood plot: championing Trump’s return to the White House and now potentially reaping the rewards. The potential framework would dismantle red tape, allowing Tesla to scale its futuristic Cybercab and Robovan models beyond the current 2,500-unit limit. Forget steering wheels and pedals—Musk’s robotaxi vision might finally leave the station.

**Regulatory Road Trip**  
  
Trump’s transition team has ambitious plans to reshape how autonomous vehicles hit the streets. Key names like former Uber exec Emil Michael and policy-minded Republican reps are being floated for leadership at the Department of Transportation.

Musk’s dream of making driverless Teslas mainstream—think fleets of robotaxis chauffeuring passengers without human backup—is closer than ever, thanks to these early-stage efforts. Cue the popcorn.

**Winners, Losers, and Sideliners**  
  
While Tesla basked in market love, Uber and Lyft investors weren’t thrilled, with both stocks dropping over 6%. 

Musk’s robotaxis could eventually outprice and outpace ridesharing apps. Meanwhile, Waymo and GM’s Cruise might feel the heat, as they’ve played it safe by sticking to autonomous cars with traditional controls. For Tesla, the stakes are clear: dominate the robotaxi race or stay stuck in regulatory limbo.

**Is This the Green Light?**  
  
Musk’s close ties to the incoming administration position Tesla as a frontrunner in the race for autonomous dominance. But before anyone pops champagne, Congress still needs to clear the road for mass deployment. 

If Trump’s team can pull this off, Musk’s long-promised vision could go from moonshot to market reality—steering the conversation and, potentially, the future of mobility.

# Super Micro Climbs Out of the Abyss

**A Compliance Comeback?**  
  
Super Micro Computer, a server maker basking in the AI boom spotlight, made a dramatic leap in after-hours trading, with shares spiking over 37%. 

The catalyst? A Hail Mary compliance plan filed with Nasdaq, complete with a new auditor—BDO USA—to replace Ernst & Young, who bailed last month citing governance concerns. Investors seem to believe Super Micro’s cleanup effort might actually stick this time.

**Scandals, Probes, and Short Sellers—Oh My!**  
  
The road here hasn’t exactly been smooth. Super Micro delayed its financial filings this summer, prompting a short-seller hit piece from Hindenburg Research and a DOJ probe.

Toss in a Nasdaq delisting warning, and this once $70 billion darling now finds itself valued at a mere $12.6 billion. Still, its pivot to AI-focused hardware has kept it relevant—and kept its ticker on traders' watchlists.

**AI Keeps the Lights On**  
  
Super Micro continues to ride Nvidia’s AI wave, unveiling products powered by the chipmaker’s shiny new Blackwell processors. That’s a big win in a market obsessed with AI innovation. 

But let’s not get carried away—Wall Street’s excitement is tempered by the company’s checkered financial reporting history and underwhelming guidance.

**Will It Stick?** With its Nasdaq fate hanging in the balance until February, Super Micro has a lot to prove. The company’s internal governance overhaul and fresh promises to meet filing deadlines could keep it afloat—if they deliver. For now, investors are cautiously optimistic, but like all good cliffhangers, we’ll have to wait to see how this one ends.

The housing market’s supply problem isn’t getting better anytime soon. Tomorrow’s report on housing starts will shed light on how many new homes are in the works, while building permit data will offer clues about what’s coming down the pipeline.

September didn’t bring much relief—new home construction dipped 0.5% to 1.35 million, and permits fell 2.9%. Economists expect October’s numbers to hold steady, but the real hope lies in lower interest rates eventually sparking a surge in builder activity. Fingers crossed.

# Netflix’s Heavyweight Gamble: Tyson vs. Paul

**A Punch at Streaming’s Future**  
  
Netflix is stepping into uncharted territory ~~tonight~~ right now as it streams a high-profile boxing match between 58-year-old Mike Tyson and 27-year-old influencer Jake Paul. 

While the spectacle promises millions of viewers, it’s also a trial run for Netflix’s live-streaming chops ahead of broadcasting two NFL games on Christmas Day. For a platform that once dismissed live sports, this is a pivotal moment to prove it can handle the pressure—or risk being knocked out of the game.

**Betting Big on Live Events**  
  
This fight isn’t just about punches—it’s about ad dollars.

Of Netflix’s 283 million subscribers, 70 million are on the ad-supported tier, offering prime real estate for advertisers during live events. If the Tyson-Paul bout performs well, Netflix could command premium ad rates, mirroring the cable TV playbook.   
  
With live NFL broadcasts already sold out, Netflix is betting on its ability to leverage sports content for future growth.

**Streaming vs. Traditional Sports Networks**  
  
The event also marks a shift in boxing’s media landscape. Once dominated by HBO and Showtime, the sport is now migrating to streaming platforms like Netflix, DAZN, and Amazon Prime. 

Tyson and Paul’s fight is Netflix’s way of signaling its intent to compete in live sports broadcasting, even as it diversifies with long-term deals like the WWE’s *Raw*and the NFL’s holiday matchups.

**The Real Test:** While the buzz around the fight is undeniable, the real winner tonight could be Netflix—or not. If the platform falters under the strain of millions of viewers, it could undermine confidence in its ability to handle future live events. 

But if Netflix pulls off a seamless broadcast, it will solidify its place as a new heavyweight in the live sports arena, setting up a much larger bout: its battle against traditional sports networks.

# Meta To Face Us Antitrust Trial Over Acquisitions Of Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta’s decade-old acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp are finally getting their day in court. 

A federal judge ruled that the FTC’s antitrust lawsuit against Meta will go to trial, alleging that the company overpaid for these platforms to eliminate competition. If the FTC wins, Meta could be forced to part ways with its prized assets, reshaping the social media landscape. 

However, Meta scored a minor victory with one claim—relating to access for third-party developers—dismissed.

**Regulators Everywhere, All at Once**  
  
The hits don’t stop there for Meta. The European Union just slapped the company with an €798 million ($840 million) fine, claiming Facebook Marketplace unfairly leveraged its dominance in social networking to outmuscle rivals. 

Meta says it’ll appeal, but the penalty adds to a growing list of regulatory headaches that have investors questioning Big Tech’s resilience.

**What’s at Stake?**  
  
Meta’s empire is under siege. A breakup of Instagram and WhatsApp would mean a significant shift in its revenue streams and market power. Meanwhile, fines and lawsuits across the globe are hitting the balance sheet. 

For a company already navigating fierce competition from TikTok and others, the uncertainty around regulatory outcomes could stymie its future growth.

**A Global Reckoning for Big Tech**  
  
Meta isn’t alone in the hot seat. Antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, and Apple are ramping up, marking a bipartisan push to rein in tech monopolies. 

The stakes are high: these trials will set the tone for how governments worldwide handle Big Tech, creating ripple effects across the sector. Investors, brace yourselves—this is just the beginning.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 

With Kennedy’s track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide. 

The market’s verdict? Kennedy’s policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy’s HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy—and leadership of Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vax group—has industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds. 

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy’s views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales. 

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy’s influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers’ performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy’s nomination is confirmed. 

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy’s potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Spirit Airlines Braces for Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines is flirting with bankruptcy after a last-ditch merger attempt with Frontier fizzled out. 

The ultra-budget airline is now in talks with creditors on a restructuring plan that would potentially wipe out its equity holders, sending Spirit’s stock plummeting over 59% on Wednesday. 

So, if you’re holding Spirit shares, let’s just say it might be time to buckle up.

# Grounded Merger Plans Leave Spirit Scrambling

Merger hopes were high for Spirit after talks with both JetBlue and Frontier put a lifeline in sight. But after JetBlue’s bid got axed by antitrust concerns, Frontier was the next best hope – until now. 

With that deal grounded, Spirit is left scrambling to negotiate its survival with bondholders. Analysts say that without a merger, Spirit may need to sell off aircraft and other assets to handle its hefty debt load, giving bondholders the upper hand over shareholders in any final deal.

# Trimming Wings to Stay Afloat

Already in belt-tightening mode, Spirit’s been trimming its fleet, furloughing pilots, and offloading older planes in a bid to free up cash. 

Yet, with a hefty $1.1 billion bond deadline on the horizon, the airline’s runway is looking short. Wall Street’s not holding its breath: with zero “buy” ratings and eight “sell” recommendations, the consensus seems clear. 

Now, it’s a waiting game to see if Spirit can emerge from this nosedive intact.

# Amazon Takes On Temu and Shein With Discount ‘Amazon Haul’ store

Amazon is making a play for the ultra-low-price crowd with its latest launch, *Amazon Haul*. Simply type “haul” into your amazon app and hit enter.

Touted as an affordable answer to Temu and Shein, Haul features a selection of everyday items capped at $20, with many under $10. In this new section, you’ll find deals like $1 iPhone cases and $5 packs of holiday socks. 

But there’s a trade-off: while Amazon has long been known for its quick Prime delivery, Haul shoppers will need to wait a bit—deliveries clock in at one to two weeks, mirroring the timelines of its Chinese rivals.

# Discounts Stack as Baskets Grow

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is offering extra discounts for larger orders, with 5% off for purchases over $50 and 10% off over $75, plus free shipping on orders above $25. 

The Haul selection covers a broad range of categories—from fashion and home goods to electronics and lifestyle items—all with an eye-catching “crazy low” price tag. Amazon’s VP of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, Dharmesh Mehta, says Haul is designed for those willing to wait a little longer to save a lot more, adding some fun and affordability to Amazon’s app experience.

It’s a clear signal that Amazon is targeting shoppers who prioritize deals over delivery speed.

# Playing the Long Game on Low Prices

Haul isn’t just a new section; it’s Amazon’s response to the rise of bargain-focused apps like Temu, which are chipping away at the traditional e-commerce model with rock-bottom pricing. 

Amazon’s willingness to take the slow lane on delivery suggests a bet on customers who are still more comfortable shopping with a familiar brand but are willing to explore lower-cost options. With all products screened for compliance, 

Amazon is aiming to sidestep the counterfeits and regulatory issues dogging Temu and Shein, providing Haul shoppers a budget-friendly and trustworthy shopping experience.

We’ll also see the Producer Price Index (PPI), which shows inflation from the perspective of producers, not shoppers. Manufacturers have been taking it on the chin lately with rising costs and rates, but last month’s flat reading sparked a bit of hope that things might be stabilizing.

# Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Amid Trump Win

Tesla's back in the trillion-dollar club. Shares skyrocketed 8% Friday, pushing its market cap over the $1 trillion threshold as investors jumped on the potential for looser regulations in a Trump administration. 

Elon Musk, Trump’s most vocal supporter and a generous campaign contributor, saw Tesla surge about 30% this week alone. With hints at slashing electric vehicle subsidies and potential trade barriers for Chinese EV players, Wall Street sees a Trump-Musk partnership as a boon for Tesla’s market share in the U.S.

**A Boost for Musk’s Billions**

The Tesla rally has also catapulted Musk’s net worth past $300 billion, marking his highest fortune since 2021. Musk has been outspoken about leveraging his influence in Trump’s administration to accelerate federal approval for autonomous vehicles, a critical step for Tesla’s self-driving ambitions. 

The partnership comes at a strategic moment, with Tesla now vying against Alphabet-owned Waymo in the autonomous driving race.

**Trump Trade Implications for Tesla’s Competitors**

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives noted that Trump’s pro-business stance could place Musk in a highly favorable position, shielding Tesla from new EV subsidies that have leveled the field for foreign competitors. 

Meanwhile, U.S. rivals and industry giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft now sit alongside Tesla in the trillion-dollar tech club, with Wall Street eagerly eyeing who will come out on top in this new era of deregulation.

# Retailers Are Prepping For Tariffs

Trump’s back in office, and with him comes a tariff policy that’s sending ripples through retail. With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers. 

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a “tax on American families.” Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.

**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**

Retailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers’ wallets hard. 

Stores that rely heavily on China for sourcing—like Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers—are particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.

**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**

Not every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump’s first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit. 

As some retailers scramble, those who’ve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what’s shaping up to be another trade showdown.

# The Trump Trade Is So Back

With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything. 

After Trump’s decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it’s 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration.

**Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring**

In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B

anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains—investors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride.

Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump’s pledge to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” And oil’s back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future.

**Clean Energy, Not So Much:** Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump’s clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind.

**Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:** Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It’s on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback.

**The Bottom Line:** While Wall Street’s in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be “too optimistic,” and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the “Trump Trade” seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it’s best to keep one hand on the exit.

# Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment

Betting markets took a big W this week, as former President Donald Trump’s election win confirmed what sites like Kalshi and Polymarket have been shouting for weeks: the odds were in Trump’s favor, despite what the polls claimed. With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight.

Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds. 

For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate—and maybe even profit—on real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves.

**Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious**

The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets.

Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone’s trying to cash in on this new political betting boom.

**The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting**

On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They’re worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader.

So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they’ll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s lineup starts with initial jobless claims—aka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It’s a big deal for the Fed’s next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision.

So, what’s the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It’s a smaller dip than the one in September, but that’s the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market’s been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer’s panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts.

But don’t get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell’s press conference later in the day. The man’s words and the Fed’s follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead.

* **Planet Fitness** banks on members who sign up, then conveniently forget to show up. But the FTC’s new “Click-to-Cancel” rule could make those “set-it-and-forget-it” memberships harder to hold onto.

But if this rule sticks, Planet Fitness might need a new game plan to keep revenue pumping. Analysts forecast $0.58 EPS and $285.87 million in revenue. ($PLNT)

# After Market Close:

* **Pinterest** has been on a wild ride lately—a strong spring, followed by a tough summer slump thanks to lackluster guidance that sent shares tumbling. But now, with the stock looking relatively cheap, investors are tuning in to see if AI can be the growth engine Pinterest needs.

It’s a fortune even Buffett isn’t sure how to spend, as he keeps dodging big-ticket buys and instead cashes out on old faves like Apple and Bank of America. Why the hoarding? Some say he’s just too seasoned to overpay in today’s market; others think he’s plotting something big.

Either way, he’s showing us what real self-control looks like.

**Apple on a Diet, Cash on a Bulk-Up**

Buffett trimmed Berkshire’s Apple stake by another 25% this quarter, whittling it down to $69.9 billion. Even though the iPhone maker still holds the crown as Berkshire’s biggest holding, it’s clear Buffett’s leaning out the tech exposure. 

The kicker? This isn’t a tech-love breakup, just a careful rebalancing to make sure Apple doesn’t end up becoming the whole show.

**Buybacks? Not This Time**

Usually, Buffett’s all about scooping up his own shares when Berkshire’s cash pile is high, but this quarter, buybacks took a timeout. And that’s surprising, given Berkshire’s been on a 25% winning streak this year. 

Analysts speculate he’s holding out for the *really* right moment to jump back in—because why not, when cash is stacking up faster than Wall Street can blink?

**Cash-Burning Dreams:** So, what’s next for Buffett’s billions? Will he finally splurge on something big, like a mega-acquisition? Or is he playing the long game, waiting for stock prices to cool off before making any serious moves? One thing’s clear: the Oracle of Omaha knows patience is a virtue—and he’s got the cash mountain to prove it.

# Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‘Unwavering’ AI Demand

Palantir just dropped a knockout earnings report, sending its stock up 15% after hours. Revenue shot up 30% in Q3 to $725.5 million, leaving analysts' forecasts in the dust. But the real kicker? 

Demand for Palantir’s AI tech in the U.S. is off the charts, setting the company up for a stellar year with a new revenue target of nearly $2.81 billion.

**The U.S. Appetite for AI**

Business is booming stateside, with commercial revenue up 54% and government revenue climbing 40% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp didn’t hold back, describing this as “unwavering demand” that’s positioning Palantir front and center in an AI-powered revolution.

The U.S. government’s appetite for advanced data tools is a big driver, making Palantir’s AI solutions essential for organizations seeking smarter, more efficient operations.

**Boosted Guidance Lights Up Investors**

With a solid quarter under its belt, Palantir has raised its guidance, now expecting full-year revenue to land between $2.805 and $2.809 billion—well above Wall Street’s estimates. 

Q4’s forecast looks equally strong, with revenue projected as high as $771 million. Given AI’s moment in the spotlight, investors are betting on Palantir’s long-term potential in this high-stakes arena.

**Global Hiccups, U.S. Dominance**

While the U.S. powers Palantir’s growth, international sales are a mixed bag, particularly in Europe, where commercial revenue slipped this quarter. Yet Karp remains optimistic, seeing the U.S. as the core of Palantir’s AI growth. 

As these tools become integral across industries, Palantir’s strong domestic foothold could keep it leading the pack, even as it navigates a few global bumps.

Two economic reports are due tomorrow—the ISM Services Index and a snapshot of the U.S. Trade Deficit. But, let’s face it, neither will come close to stealing the spotlight from the presidential election.

Election night means noise, lots of it. And with every update and needle movement, it’s tempting to hit the panic button. But seasoned investors know the real trick: tuning out the chaos and sticking to their strategy.

Here’s the game plan—keep calm, keep steady. The ones who make it big aren’t the ones glued to every election twist but those who play the long game, staying true to their plan no matter what.

# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue

Alphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. 

Revenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.

But it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. 

The ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.

**AI as Cost Cutter**  
  
With new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.

Investors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. 

And as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.

* 🍔 **McDonald’s** missed Wall Street expectations in Q3 as international sales struggled, with same-store sales dropping 1.5%—a worse hit than analysts had anticipated. The U.S. market offered a small lift with a 0.3% increase, aided by a popular $5 meal deal that resonated with lower-income consumers. Shares slipped 0.6% as investors eyed the potential impact of the recent E. coli outbreak affecting 20% of U.S. locations. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.23 ($MCD). 
* 🚗 **Ford’s** stock tumbled 8.44% after revising its 2024 outlook to the lower end of its profit range ($10 billion vs. up to $12 billion initially projected). High warranty costs and scaling back EV spending amid sluggish demand weighed on results, though Q3 earnings still beat expectations at $0.49 EPS on $43.07 billion in automotive revenue. Execs highlighted gains in its Ford Pro division but noted ongoing struggles to contain costs ($F). 
* 💳 **PayPal** fell 3.96% after issuing a revenue forecast for Q4 that undercut analyst estimates, citing a “price-to-value strategy” that may slow growth. While Q3 revenue of $7.85 billion came up slightly short, payment volume grew 9% to $422.6 billion. EPS rose 6% to $0.99, with the company focusing on enhancing checkout features and digital currencies to boost engagement ($PYPL). 
* 👟 **Crocs** plunged 19.17% after trimming its full-year sales growth outlook to 3% and forecasting a steep 15% decline in its HeyDude brand sales, as opposed to the prior 8%-10% dip expected. Crocs’ overall Q3 revenue rose 1.6% to $1.06 billion, though concerns over slower HeyDude performance and school bans on Crocs shoes kept investor sentiment down ($CROX). 
* 🔋 **AMD** slipped 7.64% in after-hours after its Q4 revenue forecast of $7.5 billion missed Wall Street’s target, dampening hopes for rapid growth in its AI chip business. Q3 saw an 18% jump in revenue to $6.82 billion and EPS in line with forecasts at $0.92, yet some investors worry AMD’s AI ambitions are lagging Nvidia’s. AI-related demand from data centers bolstered performance, but slowing gaming chip sales put a drag on results ($AMD). 
* 👻 **Snap** rebounded 7.07% after initially dropping on mixed Q3 results, with revenue climbing 15% to $1.37 billion, just ahead of expectations. Snapchat’s daily active users rose 9% to 443 million, driven by increased video engagement, though Q4 guidance came in soft as upper-funnel ad spending from large clients faltered. Snap approved a $500 million buyback as part of efforts to boost shareholder value ($SNAP). 
* 📈 **Reddit** soared 21.65% in after-hours trading as its Q3 sales and holiday-quarter forecast surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue for Q3 came in at $348.4 million, easily topping the $312.8 million consensus, and marked Reddit’s first profitable quarter since its IPO in March. The platform’s shares have nearly tripled from their debut price, a boost attributed to strong ad tech investments. For the holiday season, Reddit projects revenue between $385 million and $400 million, above the $356 million Wall Street forecasted ($RDDT).

September’s ADP report showed a strong boost in private sector jobs, with 143,000 positions added. If October’s numbers follow suit, the Fed might be smiling, knowing the labor market is still holding up amid their rate hikes.

Analysts are betting on $4.49 EPS with $12.21 billion in revenue ($LLY).

# After Market Close: 

* **Microsoft**’s partnership with OpenAI should have it dominating the AI race, and while it’s a clear leader in the field, the stock’s been sluggish. Investors are eyeing ongoing boardroom drama at OpenAI, ballooning costs, and a lukewarm reception to Microsoft’s AI products. Still, Microsoft’s pouring billions into AI infrastructure, and shareholders are hoping that investment won’t be a money pit. Consensus: $3.10 EPS, $64.48 billion in revenue ($MSFT). 
* **Meta Platforms**, meanwhile, has shifted focus from the metaverse flop to an AI-heavy strategy. Over the past 18 months, Meta has laid off tens of thousands to boost efficiency, funneled funds into smart glasses, and built up Threads. But its bread and butter? Ads. With election season fueling political ad revenue, investors are eager to see Zuckerberg’s plans for reinvesting those profits. Consensus: $5.21 EPS, $40.13 billion in revenue ($META).",10-29-2024

# iOS 18.1 Is Here: Apple Intelligence, New Siri Look, AirPod Hearing Aids and More

  
iOS 18.1 just dropped, and while the number’s small, the update’s big. 

Apple Intelligence has finally entered the chat for iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 users, adding AI-driven features that make handling notifications, cleaning up photos, and rewriting text easier. Siri even got a facelift—she’s glowing around the edges now, though her brains might still need a boost.

It’s the start of Apple’s slow-and-steady approach to AI, with bigger updates like ChatGPT integration coming in December.

**Siri Glow-Up & AirPods Hearing Boost**  
  
If you’re an AirPods Pro 2 user, you can now take a clinical-grade hearing test and turn those earbuds into custom hearing aids—because who knew AirPods could get even more versatile? 

Meanwhile, Siri’s makeover adds a sleek new look and lets you text questions, perfect for keeping things low-key in public. But heads up, many of the coolest Apple Intelligence features, like custom emojis, are set for the iOS 18.2 drop next month.

**Notifications & Photos, Reimagined**  
  
Sick of endless notifications? Apple Intelligence now packs alerts into one tidy message, cutting down the noise. The Photos app also got a cleanup button—just tap to make photobombers vanish. 

These updates keep Apple’s promise of a user-first approach to AI, with more fun features rolling out in waves. It’s clear they’re aiming for smart, streamlined interactions rather than an AI free-for-all.

**What’s Coming Next?**  
  
Apple’s playing it cool in the AI race, but the foundation is set. Expect major upgrades in iOS 18.2, from ChatGPT tools to a smarter Siri that may finally become as helpful as it looks.

Until then, iOS 18.1 offers a taste of Apple’s AI future, blending usability with privacy.

# Robinhood Jumps Into Election Trading, Giving Users Chance To Buy Harris Or Trump contracts

  
Robinhood just tossed its hat into the election betting ring, letting users wager on the 2024 presidential showdown. 

Starting today, users can buy contracts on either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump taking the White House, adding a new spin to the world of retail investing. The catch? Contracts fluctuate based on demand, with buyers scoring $1 per win, and users must meet a few eligibility requirements before diving in.

**Playing the Odds in a Tight Race**  
  
Why now? A recent court ruling gave U.S. platforms like Kalshi the green light to offer election markets, opening a whole new betting frontier. Robinhood’s take?

It’s “democratizing access” to real-time events—a statement that’s got more than a few people scratching their heads. Yet, with the race heating up, the idea of betting on democracy is sparking serious interest, even if it’s only for the presidency for now.

**Betting Markets Get a Twist**  
  
While traditional polls are crunching numbers, these betting markets take a different path—odds can swing wildly, with factors like big spenders tilting results. 

Case in point: a recent betting blitz on Trump by a single French bettor shifted his odds on Polymarket. So, while polls might say one thing, betting markets can tell a different, albeit skewed, story.

**More to Come?**  
  
With this new election feature, Robinhood is testing the waters. If it clicks with users, don’t be surprised if event-based betting options become a regular menu item. For now, 

Robinhood’s dipping its toes into a whole new category, giving retail investors a front-row seat in one of the year’s most-watched contests.

"I built an AI that reads 10,000+ news every morning for your portfolio. Check it out folks!Hi y'all! I am a college student studying Computer Science and finance.

Three month ago, I came across the idea of building an AI that can go through all news that were published within the last 24 hours and select the ones about my investment portfolios, so that I don't have to spend lots of times scrolling news apps or websites to research what happened in the world or in the market that I genuinely care.

Now, I successfully built it!

**Here is what it does**: every morning, it reads from 50+ reputable sources (around 10,000+ news). Then, based on user's chosen stock in their watchlist, my NewsGPT analyzes all news with its understanding regarding the stock and select the ones that have impact on the stocks. Every morning, it will generate a news summary and send it to the user through email.

Please check it out \[[www.dinodigest.news](https://www.dinodigest.news/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic_social)\] if you're interested in being my early-stage user (**it's free forever!**).

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple’s reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card. 

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren’t properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation. 

On top of that, Apple’s checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman’s Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn’t escape the CFPB’s scrutiny either. 

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren’t acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards. 

The situation was worsened by Goldman’s failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping—and they didn’t hold back. 

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO’s portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor’s ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn’t just about grabbing new leagues. TKO’s getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million. 

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they’re serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO’s shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO’s stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What’s Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO’s President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. 

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues—they’re stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though—at least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO’s not looking to buy more assets from its parent company. 

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500? 

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That’s a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman’s David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market. 

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it’s tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight – Oh My!**  
So where’s the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years—giving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that’s all about the big boys. 

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too—they tend to do well when the market’s top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman’s Gloom**  
Goldman’s not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade. 

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you’ve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the “analysts” think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find ways to win—you just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger’s replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger’s retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger’s successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again. 

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn’t ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates—both internal and external. But with Iger’s direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences’ Josh D’Amaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world’s biggest entertainment companies.

**Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer**  
Disney’s had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?). 

Now, with Gorman steering the board’s succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman’s experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster.

Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who’s stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman’s outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney’s board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years.

**Who’s Next in Line?**  
Four big names are in the running for Disney’s top job, and they’ve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D’Amaro, who oversees Disney’s theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites. 

He’s got a solid public profile and is leading the company’s $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back.

Then there’s Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN’s sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who’s deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there’s always a wildcard—an outside candidate waiting to swoop in. 

For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill.

"Swing Trading Vs. Day Trading: F*CK Your Stop LossUPDATE: 

Swing trade vs Day Trading + Hold Overnight Since October 14th Open to October 30 close - NVDA:

Swing % up unrealized 2.06%.                                                   

Day Trade % up realized 20.21%


Long time investor, swing trader, and day trader. I've been doing all three for a while and my girlfriend, who's a swing trader, used to tell me day trading was a Fool's Errand until she saw how profitable I am. One of the ways I illustrated this to her was to compete with her over a period of time as she swing traded stock and I day traded the same stock. As it turned out, day trading was an order of magnitude better at reaping profits than swing trading. The exercise prompted me to experiment with day trading in slightly different ways to figure out profitable, easy ways to day trade and make profits. 

Here's what I've learned about stocks over the years. 

1. Almost all stocks of healthy companies and, especially ETF's (which cycle out bad stock and cycle in good stocks periodically),  trend net upward over time. Sure they go up and down, but overall they go up. 

2. Almost all stock and ETF's make their real gains overnight. [https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/](https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/)

3. Although most gains are made overnight, stock prices swing considerably, up and down, during the intraday. 

4. The markets intraday have repeating patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/](https://tradethatswing.com/stock-market-intraday-repeating-patterns/)

5. The markets also have annual patterns. [https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/](https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/)

6. Stock with Buy and Strong Buy analyst ratings that are below their price targets tend to trade upward toward that target much more often than not.

Knowing all this, we can infer a trading strategy: 

Find a good stock with lots of upside, high volume, strong buy ratings from analysts, and average analyst price targets above the stocks current price and day trade it aggressively without a stop loss during up trending seasons and hold the stock overnight, every night (well, almost every night). Then, never hold it when a down trending season is approaching.

Take NVDA for example, which has increased 227% over the past year. If you day traded and held NVDA overnight, you'd have made considerably more than 227%. If you consider seasonal downturns which occur mainly in February, June, and September and you day trade without holding the stock overnight and accept any intraday loss - but try to avoid them - you'd make even more $$.

https://preview.redd.it/8zbntxysskvd1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c16ae98b361ef74c7bc126c989a58a93c16a7cc

Anyway, I decided to quantify and collect evidence starting this week and I will continue for this Q4 up trending season. All U.S. markets have their best gains in Q4 from roughly the end of October to the end of December. Often, though, the market continues to make gains until March with a dip in February. 

This week NVDA from Monday open to Friday's close gained -.01%. However, if you day traded NVDA as I did you would have made $$ instead of losing it like a swing trader or long term investor. Look at all those ups and downs on the NVDA chart for this week! Perfectly ripe for Day Trade pickin'!

https://preview.redd.it/mv82q8k3ukvd1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa926cbdb63efe7f23aff5d2202c3c359082cb60

So, I day traded and held NVDA every night this week and am still holding it. Instead of losing -.01%, I earned over $900. I also day traded a lot of other stock for more profit than just $900, but this is what I earned from NVDA. I'll be continuing this probably until NVDA announced earnings in March 2025.

https://preview.redd.it/8f1hqy7pukvd1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3862943df5ed00ad5eb402251843e66924e93fb

Day trading is much more profitable than swing trading and long term investing. I often day trade and hold overnight during up trending seasons for the reasons illustrated above. Oh, yeah, I also do not use stop losses. So, F your stop loss.

# Netflix’s Push to Boost Earnings Pays Off

Netflix isn’t slowing down—despite strikes disrupting Hollywood, the streaming giant added over 5 million subscribers in Q3, blowing past Wall Street’s expectations of 4.5 million. 

With revenue up 15% to $9.83 billion and earnings per share hitting $5.40, Netflix is making investors smile. Its stock? Jumped 5% in after-hours trading, reminding everyone it’s still the streaming king.

**The Password Crackdown Pays Off**   
One big driver of those numbers? Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing. Turns out, people don’t mind paying for their own accounts after all. 

But while the crackdown gave subscriber growth a temporary boost, analysts aren’t sure how long that momentum will last. Plus, Netflix’s ventures into advertising and video games haven’t yet made a major financial splash, leaving some investors skeptical about the stock’s future growth.

**Ads and Live Events: Netflix’s New Playbook**   
Speaking of advertising, Netflix’s ad-supported tier is gaining traction. Subscriptions for the ad-tier jumped 35% quarter-over-quarter, with more than half of new sign-ups opting for it in available markets. 

Netflix is doubling down on this by investing in live events—think boxing matches and NFL games—to attract more advertisers. They expect ad revenue to double by 2025, so stay tuned.

**What’s Next? More Content, Higher Prices**   
Netflix is gearing up for an even bigger slate next year, with *Squid Game* Season 2 and new live sports content leading the charge. But there’s a catch: higher prices. 

The company is raising prices in markets like Italy and Spain and phasing out cheaper plans elsewhere. It’s all part of a strategy to hit $44 billion in revenue by 2025, even if subscriber growth cools.

# ASML Cut Its Guidance For Next Year On Chip Sector Weakness

It turns out, even chipmakers have their bad days. 

ASML, the key supplier of fancy semiconductor equipment, sent shockwaves through the market this week by slashing its 2025 sales expectations earlier this week. The result? A brutal $420 billion wipeout across chip stocks in the U.S. and Asia. Why? ASML reported receiving just half the orders analysts expected, catching everyone off guard.

**The Crown Jewel of Chipmaking**   
ASML is no small fry—it’s the only company that produces the coveted ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, the $200 million beasts responsible for making cutting-edge chips that power AI programs and smartphones. 

Despite hopes that the AI boom would save the day, it wasn't enough to counteract sluggish demand from the automotive and industrial sectors. Even ASML’s big-name clients like Intel and Samsung have felt the pinch from disappointing sales.

**China’s Chip Dilemma**   
If that wasn’t enough, ASML’s biggest market—China—is in for a rough ride. New export restrictions mean ASML can’t sell its DUV machines, a crucial component for chipmaking, to Chinese companies. That’s a problem, considering nearly half of ASML’s Q2 sales came from China, with companies scrambling to snag equipment before the restrictions kicked in. 

Now, with the market drying up, ASML has some serious challenges ahead.

**What’s Next? Cloudy Skies for Chips**   
Even as the dust settles, ASML’s woes aren’t going away anytime soon. The broader chip industry continues to struggle, and while AI demand remains strong, it’s not enough to fix the inventory issues plaguing other sectors. 

With 2025 expectations lowered and no quick fixes in sight, ASML—and the entire chip market—are in for a chippy ride.

The housing market is serving up a double feature this week. First on deck: US housing starts, showing how many single-family homes broke ground last month. August clocked in at 1.36 million starts—the highest since April—while experts predict September will land pretty close at 1.35 million.

Then we’ve got building permits, aka the green light for future construction. August saw a 4.9% jump to 1.48 million, but the forecast for September expects a slight pullback to 1.45 million.

Housing starts give a glimpse of what’s already happened, while building permits hint at what’s to come. Both reports will shed light on whether those recent rate cuts have cracked open any growth in the tight housing market, or if there’s more action on the way.

# Robinhood Plans to Give Traders Access to Futures, Index Options, And Desktop Platform

Robinhood, the app that made trading accessible to the masses, is stepping into the big leagues. 

The platform is rolling out futures trading and index options, targeting more experienced investors. From stock indexes to Bitcoin and crude oil, Robinhood’s giving users access to futures trading with competitive fees—just 50 cents per contract for Gold members and 75 cents for everyone else. Looks like Robinhood’s moving beyond the meme stock hype and diving into deeper waters.

**Meet Robinhood Legend (But Not Just Yet)**  
Robinhood is getting ready to launch Robinhood Legend, its highly anticipated desktop trading platform designed for active traders. Think customizable charts, the ability to open eight windows at once, and all the technical indicators your heart desires. 

While it may not be live yet, Legend is set to give platforms like Interactive Brokers and Charles Schwab a run for their money, providing sophisticated tools in a clean, user-friendly format.

When Legend does go live, it’ll be free for all Robinhood users. Futures and index options will roll out first on mobile, with desktop compatibility arriving later. It’s a clear move to compete with more established platforms and cater to traders looking for more than just a mobile app.

**Beyond Meme Stocks: Robinhood’s New Chapter**  
Robinhood isn’t just shaking up its product lineup—it’s redefining its place in the market. With the launch of futures and index options, alongside the upcoming Legend platform, the company is targeting a more sophisticated investor base. But they’re not forgetting about the rest of us. 

To make sure everyone’s on the same page, Robinhood is rolling out educational content, including videos and guides, to help new users navigate the more advanced world of futures and options trading.

**Can Robinhood Keep the Momentum?**  
Robinhood’s stock is up a whopping 110% this year, riding high on its string of new products and services. But with potential rate cuts on the horizon, some analysts wonder if the company can keep up the pace. 

That said, if Robinhood’s big bets on derivatives and crypto pay off, the platform could be in for another strong year.

# Amazon Goes Nuclear, To Invest More Than $500 Million To Develop Small Modular Reactors

Amazon’s not just delivering packages anymore—they’re delivering energy. 

The tech giant is diving headfirst into the world of nuclear power, anchoring a $500 million investment in small modular reactors (SMRs). Partnering with X-Energy, Amazon plans to power its AI ambitions and data centers with these new-generation reactors.

Why? Because running the cloud takes a whole lot of juice, and solar panels just aren’t cutting it.

**Big Tech’s Love Affair with Nuclear**  
Amazon isn’t alone in its nuclear romance. Google and Microsoft have already swiped right on SMRs. Google recently signed a deal with Kairos Power for reactors, and Microsoft is reviving the Three Mile Island reactor to help keep its servers humming.

For these companies, nuclear offers a cleaner, high-output alternative to fossil fuels, as AI’s energy needs are skyrocketing faster than your last binge-watch session.

But it’s not just about AI—Amazon’s making sure this energy push fits with its long-term goal of hitting net-zero carbon emissions. By 2039, they aim to bring 5 gigawatts of power online, enough to keep those data centers happy and green.

**Small but Mighty: SMRs in Action**  
What makes SMRs special? Unlike the massive nuclear reactors of the past, these mini-reactors are like the IKEA version of power plants: pre-made, shipped out, and assembled on-site. They’re smaller, faster to build, and scalable, meaning Amazon can plop one down near a data center without a multi-year construction project.

Still, not everyone’s convinced. Critics argue that nuclear, regardless of size, may never be a budget-friendly solution. But for companies like Amazon, which need reliable, carbon-free power, SMRs might just be the ticket.

**Powering the Future of AI—and Beyond**  
Amazon’s investment is also a win for companies already playing in the nuclear sandbox. Startups like Oklo and NuScale have seen stock surges, and power producers like Constellation Energy are cashing in. 

And if AI keeps growing, expect nuclear power to stay on the radar for Big Tech as they look to balance innovation with environmental responsibility.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

It’s been a snooze-fest on the economic front, but Thursday’s about to drop all the data you’ve been itching for.

First up: the weekly jobless claims report, the Fed’s go-to for reading the labor market tea leaves. Last week, unemployment claims jumped by 33,000 to 258,000. Economists are calling for 260,000 this week—a little bump, but nothing to send Wall Street into a meltdown.

Next, we’ve got some manufacturing check-ins: the Philly Fed Manufacturing Index, Industrial Production, and Capacity Utilization. Translation? They’re a pulse check on the factory floor, and lately, things aren’t looking too hot in that department.

And don’t forget to keep an eye on the homebuilder confidence index, which tells us how the housing market’s holding up, plus retail sales, offering a peek into consumers’ mood as holiday shopping ramps up.

# Before Market Open:

* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is kicking off earnings season for the semiconductor giants, and investors are hoping for yet another stellar quarter. However, ASML’s recent disappointing report has cast a shadow over the sector. With semi stocks already sliding after ASML’s slip-up, this could be a buy-the-dip moment for investors—unless TSMC hits the same roadblocks. Expectations are set at $1.79 EPS and $22.81 billion in revenue. ($TSM)

# After Market Close:

* Netflix continues to rule the streaming world, and the stock’s impressive rally this year shows that shareholders are banking on more growth. But here's the catch: last year’s double-digit revenue boost means Netflix needs to keep the momentum going this quarter, even though the company expects net membership and average revenue per user to stagnate. If they don’t nail this balancing act, Netflix’s lofty stock price might take a hit. Consensus? $5.11 EPS and $9.76 billion in revenue. ($NFLX)",10-16-2024

# Boeing Raises $25B Amid Strikes, Layoffs, and Cash Crunch

Boeing’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, is facing a pretty turbulent start. 

With 33,000 striking workers grinding the production of its 737 jets to a halt, it’s been a tough month for the company. And the price tag for this gridlock? A staggering $5 billion in collective losses for Boeing, its suppliers, and Seattle-area businesses. The labor dispute is about better pay, but with both sides standing their ground, there’s no sign of a resolution anytime soon.

**The Costly Domino Effect**  
The strike is only one part of Boeing’s problem cocktail. The company is staring down $5 billion in extra costs this quarter thanks to delays in its defense and commercial units. The long-awaited 777X? Yeah, it’s pushed back another year to 2026, and that didn’t sit well with Emirates, one of its biggest customers. 

Oh, and let’s not forget the looming layoffs—Boeing is planning to cut 17,000 jobs as it tries to stop the financial bleeding. Boeing’s stock is already down 40% this year, so it’s safe to say investors aren’t thrilled.

**Cash Crunch Mode:** Boeing is desperately looking to shore up its finances. To plug its cash drain, it’s planning to raise at least $10 billion by selling shares and recently secured a new $10 billion credit line. 

That’s a good move to keep the lights on, but analysts warn that Boeing’s debt could get downgraded to junk status if it doesn’t get its act together. With $45 billion in net debt, Boeing is walking a tightrope—and the union strike isn’t helping.

**Can They Pull Up?**  
Despite all the turbulence, Boeing isn’t out of the game just yet. The company has a backlog of 5,500 aircraft orders, worth about half a trillion dollars, so there’s still a light at the end of the runway. But CEO Ortberg’s first earnings call on October 23 will be make-or-break as he tries to convince investors that Boeing can weather the storm.

Investors will be watching closely—because Boeing is in desperate need of a smooth landing.

# The Earnings Roundtable 

* 💰 **Goldman Sachs Profits Jump 45% on Trading Surge:** Goldman Sachs crushed it in Q3, with profits up 45% to $2.99 billion, driven by a banner quarter in its stock-trading division—its best in over three years. Investment banking also beat expectations, helping overall revenue rise 7% to $12.7 billion. Not everything is gold, though: fixed-income trading dipped 12%, and the firm took a $415 million hit from its exit of a credit card partnership with GM. Investors still seem bullish—Goldman’s stock is up 34% this year. ($GS)

* 🧨 **ASML Takes a Hit on Weak Chip Demand:** ASML got walloped in Q3, with shares plunging 16%, the worst drop in 26 years. The semiconductor giant reported just €2.6 billion in bookings, missing analyst expectations by nearly half. ASML blamed the weak demand on a slower-than-expected recovery in the chip sector and slashed its 2025 sales forecast, sending ripple effects through chip stocks like Nvidia. CEO Christophe Fouquet acknowledged that customer caution is weighing down growth. ($ASML) 
* 🏥 **UnitedHealth Drops on 2025 Profit Warning:** UnitedHealth Group stumbled big time, with shares falling over 8% after the company issued a 2025 profit outlook below Wall Street’s expectations. Rising medical expenses and tighter government reimbursement rules are squeezing the healthcare titan. Its medical-loss ratio, a key cost measure, hit 85.2%, higher than the forecasted 84.4%. Despite beating Q3 earnings estimates, the future looks a bit cloudy for UnitedHealth. ($UNH) 
* 📊 **Bank of America Beats on Trading and Banking:** Bank of America rode a trading and investment banking surge in Q3, with revenue from its trading desk jumping 12% to $4.93 billion. Investment banking revenue was up 15%, driven by stronger-than-expected dealmaking. Net interest income, while down, dropped less than analysts feared, giving the bank a solid footing as interest rates begin to stabilize. Shares rose .55% today, bringing BofA’s 2024 gain to 26%. ($BAC) 
* 💸 **Schwab Soars After Beating Expectations:** Charles Schwab shares shot up 6.10% today after reporting a Q3 earnings beat, with adjusted EPS of 77 cents, topping estimates. The brokerage firm also slashed $8.9 billion in debt, a sign that it's recovering from last year’s customer exodus in search of higher yields. With cash flow improving and costs under control, Schwab’s rebound from its rocky 2023 seems to be picking up speed. ($SCHW) 
* 🏬 **Walgreens to Close 14% of US Stores:** Walgreens is taking drastic measures to trim costs, announcing it’ll close 14% of its US stores over the next three years. The drugstore chain plans to shutter 500 stores in 2025 alone. Investors liked the move—shares jumped nearly 16% after Walgreens also topped Q4 earnings estimates with $0.39 per share, just above the predicted $0.36.

# On The Horizon

# Before Market Open: 

* **Abbott Laboratories** ($ABT) has been flexing its muscles in the healthcare game, with shares steadily climbing since its blockbuster Q3 2023. Last year’s sky-high results may pose a tough act to follow in Q3 2024, but don’t count Abbott out. The company’s been busy diversifying its portfolio, buying back shares, and keeping the momentum going. Analysts are calling for $1.20 EPS on $10.54 billion in revenue—let’s see if Abbott can keep the streak alive.
* **Morgan Stanley** ($MS) is set to release its Q3 earnings, and with its stock near record highs, expectations are riding on strong performances from its investment banking and wealth management units. Analysts predict $2.6 billion in net income, up from $2.4 billion last year, with $1.59 EPS on $14.35 billion in revenue. Morgan Stanley has leaned heavily into managing $5.7 trillion in client assets, which has become its largest revenue driver, shifting away from the volatility of investment banking. Competitors like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have already reported impressive gains, so the pressure is on for Morgan Stanley to deliver similar results.",10-16-2024

# 🎶 Starships Were Meant To Fly Be Caught

SpaceX just pulled off a literal grab for the history books. During Sunday’s Starship test, the Super Heavy booster returned to Earth and was *caught* by giant ""chopstick"" arms attached to the launch tower. 

This first-of-its-kind move is another step toward making space travel more reusable and cost-effective, a goal that Elon Musk has been chasing like a kid after ice cream on a hot day.

It was a picture-perfect flight: The Super Heavy booster detached from Starship at an altitude of about 40 miles, did a U-turn, and headed back to the launchpad. Instead of landing on legs, like SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets, it steered into the waiting arms of the chopsticks. Cue the cheers at mission control.

**Why It Matters**  
Reusability has always been SpaceX’s secret sauce. Traditional rockets? One and done. But Musk has been adamant that rockets should be like airplanes—you don’t throw them away after one trip. By catching the booster, SpaceX moves closer to making rapid, low-cost space launches a reality. 

This isn’t just about saving money—it’s a crucial step toward launching multiple missions in a single day.

This booster recovery milestone is also a win for NASA, which is banking on Starship to land humans on the Moon by 2026 as part of its Artemis mission. With Sunday’s success, SpaceX is proving that its reusable rocket tech isn’t just sci-fi fantasy anymore—it’s happening.

**Eyes on Mars**  
But don’t think Musk is stopping at the Moon. His ultimate goal? Sending humans to Mars. SpaceX has its sights set on launching five uncrewed Starship missions to the red planet in the next two years. Each test, like Sunday’s catch, brings Musk closer to making that dream a reality. 

So, while the Super Heavy booster’s flawless return is impressive, it’s just the beginning of SpaceX’s larger cosmic ambitions.



# Market Movements

* **💻 Nvidia Hits Record High Amid AI Chip Demand:** Nvidia ($NVDA) closed at a record high of $138.07 as demand for its AI chips continues to surge, with major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google purchasing its GPUs in large quantities.

* 🏦 **Fed Governor Waller Urges Caution on Future Rate Cuts:** Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller signaled that future interest rate cuts will be less aggressive than the previous 50 basis point reduction in September.

* **🔋 Google Signs Deal with Kairos Power for Nuclear Energy:** Google ($GOOGL) has inked a deal with Kairos Power to purchase power from small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of its efforts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. The first reactor is expected to come online by 2030, with more following by 2035, adding 500 megawatts to the grid.
* **📻 Berkshire Hathaway Increases Stake in SiriusXM:** Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in SiriusXM ($SIRI) to 32% following a recent deal by Liberty Media. Despite the stock gaining 8% on Monday, SiriusXM has struggled with subscriber losses and a 50% drop in share price YTD.
* **💻 TSMC Earnings Boosted by AI Demand:** Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM) is forecasted to report a 40% increase in Q3 profits, reaching $9.27 billion, driven by strong AI chip demand from clients like Apple and Nvidia. TSMC shares have surged 77% this year.

# Earning’s Season Is Here

Earnings season is upon us, and after a $9 trillion rally, 2024’s bullish run faces a reality check. Analysts are calling for just a 4.3% profit bump for the S&P 500 this quarter—the weakest growth we’ve seen in a year. Expectations have been on a diet, too: Back in June, experts were predicting a solid 8.4% rise. 

But don't lose hope just yet—this is Wall Street, where surprises lurk around every corner. Remember the first quarter when projections were bleak but profits soared 7.9%?

Despite the low bar, the S&P 500 has been climbing like it’s auditioning for an action movie, hitting fresh highs and clocking a 22% gain in 2024 so far. It's the best start since 1997, and some investors are betting this could lead to an earnings surprise, just like earlier this year. The optimists might just have a point.

**The AI Party Slows Down**  
Speaking of action movies, the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—are still the stars of the earnings show. Together, they’re expected to post an 18% profit rise, but don’t get too excited: their growth rate is slowing. They were churning out over 30% increases last year, but this quarter, the AI-fueled party is looking a little more low-key.

For the rest of the S&P 500, it’s a bit of a grind. Profits outside of the tech bubble are set to rise just 1.8%. But hey, a win’s a win, right? And looking ahead, analysts expect much stronger numbers in early 2025, with double-digit growth on the horizon.

**A Stock Picker’s Playground**  
Here’s where things get spicy: this could be a *stock picker’s* paradise. While overall market volatility is snoozing, individual stocks are gearing up for some wild moves. Bank of America’s data shows that post-earnings swings could be the biggest since 2021, so if you can spot the winners and losers, you might just walk away with a big payout. 

Tech, communication services, and healthcare stocks are expected to shine, while energy stocks may take a hit as crude prices slide.

**Margin Watch and Election Talk**  
As earnings trickle in, one thing everyone will be keeping an eye on is profit margins. The forecast? A slight dip to 12.9% from last quarter’s 13.1%, as companies face rising input costs. But don’t sweat it too much—margins are expected to rebound soon enough.

Oh, and let’s not forget about politics. With the U.S. presidential election around the corner, corporate America is getting nervous. Mentions of ""election"" on earnings calls are up 62% from four years ago, and history suggests investment could take a breather until the dust settles.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season kicks off tomorrow, and it’s poised to send some ripples through the markets. With big reports from key players set to roll in, investors are gearing up for what could be a pivotal moment. Expect some surprises and volatility as the numbers start to drop—this is when things get interesting.

# Before Market Open:

* Warren Buffett seems to be cooling on **Bank of America** ($BAC), offloading shares consistently for months. While that’s hardly a confidence booster, shareholders shouldn’t panic just yet. Interest rate cuts and AI developments could still bolster the bank’s long-term outlook. Plus, recent earnings from major banks signal stronger net interest income across the board. Analysts are expecting $0.77 EPS on $25.31 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile, **Albertsons Companies** ($ACI) has left investors anxiously awaiting news on its potential merger with Kroger. The deal has been in the works for two years, but even if it falls through, Albertsons remains a strong player in the grocery space. With same-store sales growth and widening profit margins, the company should continue to hold its own. The consensus? $0.48 EPS and $18.47 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **United Airlines** ($UAL) might not seem like a top pick given the turbulence the airline industry has faced lately—think major IT outages and struggling competitors. But United has managed to rise above the chaos. If Delta’s performance is any indication (despite the impact of CrowdStrike’s toll on the sector), United is likely to stay on course. Analysts remain optimistic. The consensus? $3.07 EPS and $14.78 billion in revenue.",10-14-2024
Is NVIDIA's last week surge just a mirage fueled by the yen carry trade?,10-11-2024
"Premarket report - All the market moving news and earnings reports, all sumamrised for you in one 5 minute read. MACRO DATA:

* GDP YoY came in short of consensus, at 1% vs 1.4% expected
* 3 month average was also slightly short of consensus
* MOM was in line.  So weak GDP numbers 
* Inflation rate in Germany came in line with expectations - this was a final revision so not a big deal. Preliminary print had already paved the way.
* PPI event today. 
* Consumer inflation expectations - expected to have risen as commodity index has been on the rise. 
* Current conditions probably slightly better than expected, but let’s see. I say this as the economic surprise index has been trending up meaning we are more likely to surprise to upside than downside right now. 

MARKETS:

* SPX slightly down in premarket, mostly dragged by Tesla. 
* Nasdaq the same
* GER40 Flat today
* Dow up as banking earnings come strong
* Gold higher in premarket as positioning is strong. 
* HKG50 slightly higher as Fiscal announcements to come on Monday 

TSLA 10/10 EVENT

* Analyst reaction is that of disappointment by lack of substantive details and no announcement of Model 2. Tech on show was good though. No update on rate of improvement in FSD system. I am reading a number of big bank research desks making this same criticism. 
* UBS went as far as to rate Tesla a sell. 
* NVDA:  Goldman raises PT to 150 from 135. Conviction Buy
* **Nvidia’s latest AI chips, Blackwell, are sold out for the next 12-months, media report, citing Nvidia’s management team, including CEO Jensen Huang, at investor meetings hosted by Morgan Stanley. Customers ordering the chips today will receive them late next year**
* AMZN - Record Amazon Prime sales day. 
* AMZN rated outperform by Scotiabank who give price target 245. Says they have high confidence consumers will increasingly use Amazons services and optimistic on the company’s ability to monetise AI. 
* We expect near- to medium-term opportunities in corporate use cases  GOOGL - Scotiabank rate outperform, PT of 212. ""We have a high level of confidence that consumers will increasingly use Alphabet's services in the future, and we are optimistic about the company's ability to monetize its AI investments.""
* LOL they literally used the same analysis piece for both AMZN and GOOGL. Wtf. 

OTHER COMPANIES

* UBER - pumping this morning as Tesla’s robotaxi event disappointment seen as bullish for UBER. Citi note that **Tesla's event yesterday was a POSITIVE outcome for Uber, as Tesla did not provide verifiable evidence of progress toward Level 3 autonomy or specific robotaxi production numbers. This removes a major overhang and allows investors to focus on UBER fundamentals**
* AMD EVENT YDAY: Down 4% yesterday, flat in premarket today. Is a major tailwind for NVDA funnily enough, more so than AMD although AMD price action probably overreaction.
* Again, I have a full post on this with all of my thoughts here:
* Mixed reaction from analysts. Wells Fargo say is a buy. Overweight, PT 205. Others say was a bit of a non event. 
* RACE: JPM upgrades RACE to overweight, raises PT to 525. 
* Said they are upgrading shares after investor meeting with CEO highlighted positives including drivers of high visibility earnings growth. Enthusiastic demand. Record pricing and backlog.  
* TEAM - Morgan Stnaley overweight rating, PT of 224. Raising Price target and naming shares Top pick. we see this as a compelling entry point for long-term investors.""
* AFRM - Wells Fargo upgraded to overweight from Equal eight, Raises PT to 52 from 40. Says the company has demonstrated its ability to incrementally gain ecommerce checkout market share for long term. 
* MBLY - downgraded by Mizuho to neutral from outer-form, PT of 13. see challenges ahead with weaker EyeQ and SuperVision expectations and limited catalysts over the next 12-18 months. Plus slowing ev sales in US

# Tesla’s Robotaxi Day Is Upon Us After A Decade Of Promises

Elon Musk, never one to shy away from grand promises, is gearing up for Tesla’s biggest reveal since the Model 3. Tonight at 7 p.m. Pacific (10 p.m. Eastern), the long-awaited robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, will make its debut at Warner Bros. studios. For those tuning in, the event will be livestreamed on Musk’s X platform (formerly known as Twitter).

For Musk, this is more than just a new car—it’s a pivot toward AI and robotics that he believes could propel Tesla’s value to $30 trillion (yes, trillion). But as history has shown, Musk’s lofty ambitions often come with missed deadlines, so investors are cautiously optimistic.

**Can Tesla Go Driverless?**  
The hype is real, and Tesla’s stock has surged 52% since the event was announced. But skeptics are quick to remind everyone that Musk has been teasing the robotaxi concept since 2016, with little to show for it. While Waymo already has driverless cars cruising around cities like San Francisco and Phoenix, Tesla’s autonomous tech still requires human oversight. 

The big question: Can Tesla leapfrog its competitors and actually deliver on the promise of a fully autonomous vehicle?

**All Eyes on the Cybercab**  
Musk has called tonight’s event “one for the history books.” The Cybercab, expected to be a sleek, two-seater without a steering wheel, could launch Tesla into new territory. However, the road ahead is bumpy. 

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software still isn’t fully autonomous, and regulatory hurdles are a massive roadblock. While Waymo is already operational in select cities, Tesla will need to convince regulators and investors that its tech is ready for primetime.

**High Hopes, Big Risks**  
Analysts are split. Bulls see the robotaxi as a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, potentially adding $4 billion in sales by 2030. Skeptics, on the other hand, point to Musk’s track record of overpromising and under-delivering. If tonight’s event doesn’t meet expectations, it could deal a blow to Tesla’s stock, which is already down nearly 40% from its peak. 

But if Musk pulls it off? Tesla might just shift into the next gear, leaving competitors in the dust.

# AMD Launches AI Chip To Rival Nvidia’s Blackwell

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) has been hot on Nvidia’s trail, trying to stake its claim in the booming artificial intelligence chip market. On Thursday, AMD revealed its newest AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, at an event in San Francisco. While CEO Lisa Su boasted about the chip's edge over Nvidia’s H100, investors were left wanting more. 

AMD’s stock slid 4% after the event, its steepest drop in over a month, as key details about customers and financial performance remained elusive.

**The AI Chip Race Heats Up**  
With Nvidia dominating the AI accelerator market, AMD is in catch-up mode. Su claims the MI325X, with its new high-bandwidth memory, offers better AI inference performance. 

But here’s the catch: Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell chips, set to ship next year, could leave AMD’s latest chip in the dust. Investors have been eagerly waiting for AMD to prove it can chip away at Nvidia’s market share, but Thursday’s event fell short of the expected breakthrough.

**Growing Market, Fierce Competition**  
AMD is playing the long game, forecasting the AI chip market to hit $500 billion by 2028. While the company is making strides in AI, capturing just 34% of the market for server CPUs, Nvidia remains the top dog with over 90% of the data center AI chip market. 

And while AMD’s AI accelerators have potential, the widespread use of Nvidia’s CUDA programming language continues to lock developers into the Nvidia ecosystem, making it harder for AMD to gain traction.

**Looking Ahead:** AMD has ambitious plans, unveiling its next-generation MI350 GPU series, set to arrive in 2025 with a whopping 35 times more performance than its predecessors. But by then, Nvidia may have already one-upped AMD with newer, more powerful GPUs. 

Investors are keeping a close watch on whether AMD can deliver on its promises and grab a bigger slice of the AI pie, but for now, Nvidia still holds the upper hand.

# The DOJ Wants To Break Up Google’s Monopoly

Google's monopoly reign might be facing its toughest challenge yet. The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) is weighing a move that could break up the tech titan after a judge ruled it unlawfully dominated search and ad markets. 

In a court filing, the DOJ proposed everything from breaking off pieces of Google’s business (think Chrome and Android) to forcing the company to share its search data with competitors. It’s a bold step that echoes the antitrust battles of the early 2000s…remember Microsoft?

Not surprisingly, Google isn’t too thrilled. The company called the DOJ’s plan ""radical"" and warned that messing with its business model could have unintended consequences, like fewer free services for users. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares slid 1.6% on the news—cue the market jitters.

**Tech Titans Under the Microscope**  
Google’s not the only one sweating right now. Almost half of the S&P 500, including big names like Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon, are in antitrust hot water too. Regulators are accusing them of crushing competition and monopolizing key markets. 

But, despite these lawsuits, Big Tech’s still living its best life, with stock prices climbing thanks to AI innovation.

The DOJ’s real focus? The future of search, especially with AI on the rise. They want to prevent Google from flexing its dominance as AI-powered search tools become the norm. Regulators are thinking long-term here, trying to stop Google from maintaining its stranglehold in the tech space.

**The Long Legal Road Ahead**  
Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled Google was guilty of monopolistic behavior, now has to decide what to do about it. The DOJ’s suggested remedies range from “just change your behavior” to “time to break up the band.” 

While some experts think a breakup is unlikely (at least anytime soon), this legal battle is far from over. Google’s going to fight, and they’re likely to appeal any decisions not in their favor.

**The Big Picture:** Despite the legal storm, analysts aren’t losing sleep over it. Tech stocks have been riding high, with investors more interested in earnings and product launches than courtroom drama. For now, it’s business as usual, but if the DOJ really manages to pull off a Google breakup? Well, that could be a game-changer.

# WeightWatchers To Offer Compounded GLP-1 Weight-Loss Drugs

WeightWatchers just jumped into the weight-loss drug game with a twist. The company announced it’ll start offering a compounded version of Wegovy (aka a cheaper knockoff) after facing shortages of the real deal. 

At $129 for the first month and $189 thereafter, it’s a far cry from the $1,300 price tag of branded options like Ozempic. Naturally, the stock shot up by nearly 47% on the news.

But the real question is—how long can this ride last?

**It’s Getting Crowded in Here**  
WeightWatchers is showing up a bit late to the knockoff Wegovy party, where companies like Hims & Hers and Noom have been hanging out for months. But what WeightWatchers brings to the table is its bread-and-butter combo of behavioral coaching and clinical support. 

So, it’s not just about the drugs—it’s about changing the whole lifestyle.

Still, the FDA is cracking down. They’ve already removed drugs like Mounjaro from the shortage list, which means compounded versions could disappear fast. For now, semaglutide (the magic behind Wegovy and Ozempic) remains in short supply, so WeightWatchers might still have time to carve out its slice of the market.

**WeightWatchers' Identity Crisis**  
This move comes at a shaky time for WeightWatchers. They’ve had a rough year, with their stock losing more than 90% of its value. Plus, CEO Sima Sistani exited stage left just two weeks ago, and Oprah—yes, *the* Oprah—ditched the board earlier this year after admitting she’s been on weight-loss meds herself. Yikes.

But interim CEO Tara Comonte is trying to steer the ship by banking on this drug offering, even as the weight-loss world shifts away from the traditional ""dieting"" approach that WeightWatchers has been known for.

**Can They Keep the Momentum?:** The stock surge suggests investors like what they’re seeing for now, but the weight-loss landscape is getting tougher by the day. With FDA regulations tightening and plenty of competitors already in the game, it’ll be interesting to see how long WeightWatchers can keep riding this wave.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The weekly initial jobless claims report is here again, and all eyes are on it, especially with the Fed’s focus on the labor market as it charts the course for future rate cuts.

However, tomorrow’s CPI report is set to steal the spotlight. CPI tracks the monthly price shifts in goods that Americans buy, making it a crucial measure of inflation. Economists predict a 2.3% annual increase in September’s CPI, up from August’s 2.1%, while core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to hold steady at 3.2%. If these numbers hold, the Fed may feel more confident about proceeding with rate cuts. But any surprises could throw a wrench in those plans, keeping investors on edge.

# Short Seller Hindenburg Goes After Roblox

Roblox had a rough Tuesday after Hindenburg Research, a notorious short-seller, came swinging with allegations that the gaming platform is playing fast and loose with its numbers. 

The report accused Roblox of inflating user data and failing to protect its youngest players from harmful content. Naturally, the stock took a dive, dropping nearly 10% in early trading—a steep fall for the platform that’s been a favorite among younger gamers.

**More Bots Than Humans?**  
Hindenburg’s beef? The firm claims Roblox has been cooking the books by counting bots and duplicate accounts as individual users. According to the report, Roblox's daily user count may be overstated by up to 42%. And while Roblox claims its users are spending hours immersed in the digital world, Hindenburg suggests a lot of that ""engagement"" comes from bots that are just... there.

But the bigger blow? Hindenburg also painted a grim picture of the platform’s safety features, claiming Roblox isn’t doing enough to keep predators at bay. And for a platform with millions of young users, that’s a serious accusation.

**Roblox Fights Back**  
Roblox wasn’t about to sit quietly. The company shot back, calling Hindenburg’s report ""misleading"" and driven by the short-seller’s agenda. In a statement, they emphasized that user safety is a top priority and that the financial metrics they report are accurate. 

Roblox's defense comes with some financial backing: the company saw a 22% boost in bookings year-over-year and reported $576 million in free cash flow for the second quarter.

**The Fallout:** Despite the firm’s aggressive rebuttal, Roblox’s stock took a hit, falling by 9.4% before regaining some ground. Investors are likely left wondering if Hindenburg’s accusations will have lasting effects or if Roblox can shake off the controversy like it has before. Either way, it’s clear that the platform’s future will be closely watched, especially when it comes to how it handles both its user base—and the safety of those users.

# China Stocks Lose Steam, Traders Disappointed Without More Major Stimulus

China’s stock markets went from euphoria to disappointment faster than you can say “stimulus.” After weeks of rallying on hopes for a massive fiscal boost, investors were left high and dry on Tuesday when the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced just 200 billion yuan in spending—way short of the expected 3 trillion yuan. The Hang Seng Index dropped nearly 10%, marking its worst day since 2008, while Chinese stocks lost almost half their gains from an 11% surge earlier in the day.

The market's reaction is a clear sign of a mismatch between investor expectations and Beijing’s cautious fiscal stance. The rally, driven by monetary easing and government promises, now seems shaky without substantial fiscal follow-through.

**Stocks on a Rollercoaster**  
It wasn’t just disappointment in the air—it was a stock sell-off. Bank of China tumbled 5.38%, and the yuan slipped 0.64% against the dollar. The once-booming rally fizzled as investors realized that Tuesday’s announcement wasn’t the knockout punch they were hoping for. 

Analysts at Jefferies had pegged the potential damage at 175 billion yuan in a worst-case scenario, but Beijing’s response left the markets wondering if that punch is ever coming.For a brief moment, China’s stock market had a party—rising over 30% since late September—but the NDRC’s meager offering effectively ended the celebration.

**Is There More in the Pipeline?**  
While Tuesday’s lackluster stimulus dampened spirits, some analysts believe the big guns are still on their way. Banks like Morgan Stanley are betting that up to 2 trillion yuan in stimulus could still be in the works. The key question now: Will President Xi pull the trigger before markets lose faith?

For now, traders are left in a wait-and-see mode, with hopes that Beijing will unveil the kind of aggressive fiscal measures needed to fuel a long-term recovery. Until then, investors might need to buckle up for more market turbulence.

"I've lost my confidence Hello everyone, 

I got into investing about 5 years ago, but never trading individual stocks. 3 years ago I had a feeling about NVIDIA and dumped most of my savings into it and made a small fortune. My next few trades I put up almost half my account in each one and lost $120k in a day.

Now, whenever I enter a trade and it goes into the red I exit the position immediately when I know I should hold it. The trades almost always reverse course and shoot back the other way within a week, but my psyche is so fucked. Its like I have PTSD for losing money. 

How do I deal with this? Any books you recommend? Thanks!

Edit:
I’m not just buying random stocks. I get up at 6:15 am to look at analyst upgrades, read the news, etc. Then I’ll enter a position - but as soon as it goes into the red I will sell. Then I’ll keep an eye on the stock after selling, and the stock will have gone up 5,10,30%. 

Just last week I bought $50k of VST at $119. I was sure of the trade. It went to $117 so I sold. Over the next week it rallied to $135. This has happened with multiple stocks over the last 3 months. I’ve lost out on hundreds of thousands of dollars due to fear. 

Edit 2:
Once again, today I made 4 trades. I set my stop losses at 5-7%, and each trade (if stop loss were triggered) would have cost me 1% of my portfolio.

At 9:30, the trades started dropping so I sold and lost like $2k. Now, 3 hours later, they ALL reversed course to the positive. The problem isn’t my education. I am a good trader and if I didn’t bail, I would have made money on 8 of my last 10 trades. It’s anxiety, and the fact that I am disabled and don’t work, so I can watch stocks all day if I want to.",10-07-2024

# Spirit Airlines Explores Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) is running out of fuel—financially speaking. After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It’s not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses.

Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let’s be honest—the options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue’s coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations.

With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit’s balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking—Spirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit’s credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes.

**A Rocky Ride**  
Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher.

Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies.

With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring.

# OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion at $157 Billion Valuation

Call OpenAI the Silicon Valley darling—this AI powerhouse just scored $6.6 billion in fresh funding, catapulting its valuation to a staggering $157 billion. Thrive Capital, led by Josh Kushner, took the lead with a $1.3 billion investment, while Microsoft—OpenAI’s most dedicated cheerleader—added another $750 million to its $13 billion pile. Other heavy hitters like Khosla Ventures, Fidelity, Nvidia, and SoftBank couldn't resist jumping on the AI hype train.

With this cash infusion, OpenAI is officially rubbing shoulders with the elite—joining the ranks of the top three venture-backed startups, alongside SpaceX and TikTok’s parent, ByteDance. But it’s not just about the dollars; it’s about strategy. OpenAI is playing it smart by keeping rivals at bay—asking investors to steer clear of backing competitors like Anthropic and Musk's xAI. Staying on top isn’t just about innovation—it’s about making sure others don’t catch up.

**Fueling the AI Dream**  
This new funding will power more AI research and expand computing capacity, keeping OpenAI at the forefront of the field. Their star attraction, ChatGPT, now flaunts 250 million weekly active users. But there’s a price to pay—OpenAI expects to burn through $5 billion this year against $3.7 billion in revenue. Developing next-level AI tech isn’t exactly a budget-friendly hobby.

OpenAI’s internal shakeups have added to the drama. CEO Sam Altman got the boot and then came back like a Silicon Valley comeback story. Plus, key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati have exited, stirring uncertainty. There’s also talk of ditching the nonprofit label for a for-profit model—a move that makes investors giddy but could come with its own set of legal headaches.

**Zoom Out**  
AI is more than just cool tech—it’s a battleground, and OpenAI is right in the thick of it. Heavyweights like Google and Meta are breathing down its neck, while new challengers are cropping up everywhere. With a potential IPO on the horizon, Sam Altman and his team are betting big on their vision—and their capital.

Buckle up, because the AI race just went into overdrive.

# Tomorrow

Brace yourselves—tomorrow’s jobs report is shaping up to be a big one. Ever since July’s job data tanked the market, investors have been glued to these reports. That month’s lower-than-expected employment numbers had everyone panicking that the Fed might have missed the mark on managing a recession, sending stocks into a nosedive.

August helped ease those fears a bit, with 142,000 jobs added (a nice recovery from July’s 114,000) and unemployment holding steady at 4.2%. But the labor market remains in the spotlight, especially with the Fed tying future rate decisions to employment data. September’s numbers? Economists are eyeing 140,000 new jobs, a slight dip but nothing too alarming—unless it’s much lower. In that case, October’s already shaky market could take a serious hit.",10-04-2024
"Here's everything thats noteworthy in premarket, all summarised in one 5 minute read to help you to prepare for your trading day. Geopolitical news from yesterday:

* Market basically awaiting Israeli response. Likely to be targeted at Iran’s Oil infrastructure. This will be the key.

# Iran Sends a Message... and Missiles

In a not-so-subtle move, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves across both the Middle East and global markets. The attack comes hot on the heels of Israel’s targeted killings of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, including the dramatic airstrike that took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, never one to shy away from a response, promised swift retaliation.

""Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it,"" Netanyahu stated.

Markets Feel the Heat  
This missile barrage didn't just light up the night sky – it sent oil prices soaring over 5% as investors braced for potential supply disruptions. Global stock markets, already jittery, took a hit, with major indices retreating as traders sought safety in bonds and gold. The Dow dropped over 250 points, while oil bulls celebrated the sudden spike in WTI crude prices.

The Middle East remains a powder keg, and this latest escalation between Iran and Israel has made energy traders reach for their helmets.

Defensive Maneuvers  
Most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel’s vaunted defense systems (with a little help from the U.S.), but a few managed to slip through. While the immediate damage was minimal, Netanyahu made it clear that Israel wouldn’t just let this slide. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden got involved, ordering American naval ships to fire interceptors in support of Israel.

But here’s the kicker: despite all the missile action, the market impact was limited... for now. Iran warned of further retaliation if Israel pushes back, and that looming threat could be enough to keep investors on edge.

The Aftershock  
Iran's show of force might have been aimed at Israel, but it sent ripples through global financial markets. Oil surges, stock dips, and safe-haven assets like bonds and gold saw some love. Investors, already skittish from broader geopolitical risks, aren't exactly thrilled about the idea of an expanded Middle Eastern conflict.

If the tension continues to escalate, expect volatility to hang around like that last guest who just won't leave the party.

# Dockworkers Launch Strike at Ports From Maine to Texas

Dockworkers from Maine to Texas have shut down some of the country’s busiest ports in a move that could strangle trade just as the holiday season gears up. The strike, led by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), is driven by demands for a massive wage increase and resistance to port automation. Thousands of workers walked off the job early Tuesday, halting the flow of goods at critical trade hubs.

This is no ordinary labor dispute—it's a power play. Now he has laid down the gauntlet to Joe Biden, threatening to “cripple” the US economy with strike action. And with the holiday season just around the corner, they have the leverage to do it.

Retailers Brace for Impact  
Big retailers, including Walmart, Costco, and IKEA, say they’ve prepared for the strike by stocking up early and rerouting shipments to West Coast ports. But even they admit that a prolonged strike will drive up costs and could lead to shortages of key products. Shipping costs are already on the rise, and it’s only a matter of time before consumers feel the pinch.

For now, holiday shoppers can breathe easy. But the longer this drags on, the harder it will be to keep shelves stocked.

Industries Feeling the Heat  
The auto industry, which relies heavily on East Coast ports for vehicle imports, is especially vulnerable. European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen are expected to take the biggest hit. But not everyone is suffering—air freight companies like FedEx and UPS are positioned to cash in as businesses scramble for alternative shipping methods.

Some companies are prepared for the long haul, but even the best-prepared businesses won’t escape unscathed if the strike stretches beyond a week. JP Morgan analysts estimate the U.S. economy could lose up to $4.5 billion per day from the disruption.

Crippling the Economy?  
Harold Daggett isn’t playing around. He’s leading a movement that could bring the U.S. economy to its knees, just as it did during the last major dockworker strike in 1977. With billions at stake and mounting political pressure, it’s a waiting game to see how long businesses—and consumers—can hold out.

This strike might be making history, but it’s also setting the stage for a holiday season none of us will forget.

# Nike’s Guidance? Just Do… It Later

Nike is playing it cautious, hitting the snooze button on its full-year guidance and pushing off its investor day, originally set for November. Why? A new CEO, Elliott Hill, is about to step in, and the company’s latest earnings showed a 10% drop in sales, so there’s some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Nike beat earnings expectations by $0.18 per share, but revenue? Missed the mark. The company reported $11.59 billion, slightly under the $11.65 billion analysts were hoping for. Investors weren't thrilled—shares slipped 5.32% in after-hours trading.

New Boss, New Playbook?  
With Hill taking the reins soon, Nike’s buying some time. Postponing the investor day gives him space to craft a fresh strategy—much needed, considering Nike expects revenue to slide another 8-10% next quarter. Ouch.

Investors are holding their breath, and they’re not exactly feeling the love. Nike’s stock is down 18% this year, far behind the S&P 500’s 20% gain. Hill’s going to need more than a pep talk to turn this ship around.

A Few Silver Linings  
Not everything is gloomy in swoosh land. Nike’s gross margin came in higher than expected, hitting 45.4%, thanks to smart price adjustments and lower logistics costs. Plus, sales in Greater China outperformed, with that region showing some resilience.

But it wasn’t enough to make up for weakness in North America and Europe, where sales tumbled. Even Converse couldn’t lace up a win—continuing to weigh on overall performance.

Gross margin up, but sales still slipping.

What’s Next for Nike?  
As Hill steps in, he’ll need to put the innovation pedal to the metal. Nike’s been leaning too hard on legacy lines like Air Jordans, Dunks, and Air Force 1s—shoes that used to sell out in seconds but now struggle to hold the same hype. Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike’s product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

Tomorrow, it's time for another pulse check on the labor market with the ADP National Employment Report, giving us a look at private sector job growth across the U.S.

Yes, jobs are still being added, but the slowdown has economists sweating. For September, the magic number is 128,000. Anything less, and you can bet the Fed will be paying extra attention.

# DirecTV scoops up Dish for $1

After two decades of on-again, off-again talks, DirecTV and Dish are finally tying the knot. DirecTV will scoop up Dish for a jaw-dropping $1 (yep, that’s not a typo) and inherit a not-so-sweet $9.75 billion in debt. Why the big move? They’re hoping a combined front will help them survive the ruthless streaming wars.

Streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon have slashed into satellite TV’s customer base, leaving DirecTV and Dish clinging to shrinking market share. Together, the companies have lost over 60% of their subscribers since 2016. 

**AT&T Waves Goodbye**  
AT&T, once DirecTV’s proud parent, is making a clean break. The telecom giant is offloading its remaining 70% stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG for a cool $7.6 billion, officially kissing the media world goodbye. Remember, this is the same company that spent a whopping $48.5 billion to buy DirecTV back in 2015. Oh, how times change.

For AT&T, this deal is part of its grand strategy to refocus on cellphones and broadband, leaving the Hollywood dreams behind. Shareholders are crossing their fingers for a bigger dividend payout from that fresh cash infusion.

**Debt, Bondholders, and Red Tape, Oh My!**  
Not so fast—this deal isn’t set in stone yet. Dish’s bondholders will have to agree to write off $1.57 billion of debt, and the whole operation still needs the green light from regulators. But with streaming services gobbling up the market, industry insiders are hopeful the merger will slide through without too much fuss.

If it all goes according to plan, the merger could give the new mega-company more muscle to negotiate with content creators like Disney and Warner Bros. A little bargaining power never hurt anyone.

**The Endgame**  
The new DirecTV-Dish combo will boast around 18 million subscribers, making it the biggest pay-TV provider in the U.S. But let’s be real—that’s still a sinking ship. Cord-cutting isn’t slowing down, and satellite TV feels a bit... 2005.

Still, by teaming up, the two hope they can scrape by with fewer costs and a stronger negotiating hand. Survival of the fittest, right?

The question remains: Can a revamped satellite service stay relevant in a world where everyone’s streaming? Only time—and your Netflix subscription—will tell.

# Powell Signals Rate Cuts Ahead, But “No Hurry”

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell isn’t in a rush to cut rates. While the Fed plans to lower interest rates ""over time,"" Powell emphasized that decisions will be made cautiously and based on incoming data. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics, he reiterated that the economy is holding strong, but rate cuts will be gradual.

The Fed’s strategy? Slow and steady wins the race, with no fixed game plan.

**Inflation: Job’s Not Finished Yet**  
Powell reminded everyone that while inflation has eased, tapping into his inner Kobe, the job isn’t finished. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure rose 2.2% over the past year, which is a good sign, but not quite where they want it. Powell's taking a measured approach, determined not to let inflation make a comeback.

The bottom line: they’ll keep fighting inflation until it’s fully under control.

**Labor Market: Cooling Off, but Still Strong**  
On the employment front, the labor market remains solid but has cooled compared to last year. Powell noted that job conditions don’t need to weaken further to reach inflation goals, which is good news for anyone fearing a spike in unemployment.

Economists predict 150,000 new jobs were added in September—slower growth, but still steady.

**Looking Ahead**  
Powell hinted at two more quarter-point rate cuts this year, but the Fed is keeping its options open. If the economy performs better or worse than expected, those plans could change. Flexibility is the name of the game.

The Fed’s ultimate goal? A soft landing where inflation falls, and the economy keeps chugging along—without any sharp jolts. Powell’s in no rush, but he’s keeping his eyes on the prize.

Economists are predicting another small drop to 7.64 million—if it drops more, get ready for chatter about a labor market slowdown.

# Super Micro’s Big Plunge

On Thursday, Super Micro Computer shares nosedived 12%, all thanks to *The Wall Street Journal* breaking the news that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the company. The probe? Allegations from a former employee that the company has been playing loose with its accounting books.

It’s not the kind of headline you want when your stock is riding high on AI demand.

**Accounting Drama, Round Two**  
This isn’t Super Micro’s first time facing financial scrutiny. In 2020, the company settled a $17.5 million case with the SEC over accounting issues. But now, whistleblower Bob Luong claims the server maker overstated revenue—and short-seller Hindenburg Research jumped right in with a report highlighting ""glaring accounting red flags.""

Hindenburg also pointed to other concerns, including undisclosed related-party transactions and export control failures. The new DOJ inquiry just adds to the pressure.

**AI Boom Meets Legal Gloom**  
Super Micro had been riding the AI wave like a pro, with their servers powering the needs of giants like Nvidia and Meta. The stock was up 42% this year before Thursday's bad news.

Now, with the DOJ in the picture, the company’s glowing reputation has taken a hit—even as CEO Charles Liang assures customers that their AI-driven business remains as strong as ever.

**Investors Hit the Pause Button**  
Despite Liang's statement dismissing the Hindenburg report as “inaccurate,” the damage was done. Shares dropped to $373 before rebounding slightly to finish the day around $400.

While analysts are divided, with some halving their price targets and others seeing potential for recovery, the DOJ probe has definitely left investors rethinking their enthusiasm.

# Costco Reports Strong Profit Ahead of Holiday Season

Costco reported better-than-expected earnings this quarter, with a solid $5.29 per share, beating analyst predictions. Shopper traffic increased across the U.S., though visitors tightened their belts a bit, spending slightly less per trip. Still, paid memberships rose, and about 90% of members renewed. While revenue came in slightly below estimates at $79.7 billion (vs. $79.96 billion), the wholesale giant’s ability to keep shoppers spending despite economic headwinds proves it’s still got the magic touch.

But it wasn’t just foot traffic keeping Costco afloat.

**Non-Food Sales Surge**  
The retailer saw strong growth in its non-food items, with online sales surging by nearly 19%. From home furnishings to gift cards, Costco’s e-commerce arm, under new leadership, is flourishing. Gold bullion and appliances were also standout performers, proving that customers are venturing beyond the grocery aisles.

Memberships continue to be a key revenue driver.

**Membership Boost on the Horizon**  
Costco recently hiked its membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, setting the stage for future revenue growth. Right now, Executive members make up almost half of all paid sign-ups, and membership fee income hit $1.51 billion for the quarter. While a slight miss compared to analyst expectations, the higher fees will show up in the next earnings cycle.

As for Costco’s competitors, it’s clear who’s winning.

**Leading the Retail Pack**  
While Walmart and Target saw mixed results, Costco continues to gain market share, especially in the e-commerce space. Consumers are leaning into the value Costco offers, with its private-label Kirkland Signature brand boosting loyalty. Even with economic uncertainty, Costco’s strong positioning keeps it ahead of the curve.

Investors are keeping a close eye on holiday projections.

# Harris vs. Trump — 2024 Economic Policies

With the election in full swing, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have locked in on a key issue: saving the American middle class. Both candidates are unveiling ambitious economic plans in crucial swing states, hoping to win over voters. Harris’s “opportunity economy” focuses on future industries like AI and biotech, while Trump is banking on tariffs to “rescue” the middle class.

Their strategies signal a high-stakes competition for votes.

**Tariffs vs. Tech: Competing Visions**  
Trump took the stage in Savannah this week, praising tariffs as “one of the most beautiful words.” His solution? Slap new tariffs on companies that manufacture abroad, encouraging businesses to shift production back to the U.S.

Meanwhile, Harris delivered her pitch in Pittsburgh, pledging to outcompete China in industries like biotech, clean energy, and blockchain. She’s promising to strengthen America’s industrial policy and ensure the U.S. leads in key sectors.

Both candidates are betting big on manufacturing, but they might be missing the bigger picture.

**Swing States, High Stakes**  
In states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, the candidates are focusing on union-friendly voters. Manufacturing jobs are a big talking point, but there’s a catch—manufacturing only makes up 10% of Pennsylvania’s workforce. The U.S. economy is increasingly service-driven, accounting for over 70% of its value.

Focusing too much on manufacturing may leave the broader economy overlooked.

**The Middle-Class Mirage**  
Harris and Trump may be selling visions of a middle-class revival, but delivering on these promises is a different story. Harris’s high-tech focus may not trickle down to everyday workers, while Trump’s tariffs could raise prices for consumers.

Both candidates are pulling out all the stops—but can they truly deliver?

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index—aka PCE, for those in the know—still reigns supreme as the Fed’s favorite inflation tracker. But honestly, does inflation even matter anymore?

Recently, the Fed’s been way more into the other side of its job: employment. A shaky labor market had investors sweating in August, and the stock market definitely felt it. While things have calmed down, reports like this week’s consumer confidence survey show that job worries are still hanging around.

But don’t get it twisted—inflation’s still on the Fed’s radar. Central bankers, in their speeches this week, made it crystal clear they’re keeping a close watch on rising prices, especially the core PCE (the one that skips food and energy).

Tomorrow’s PCE report is expected to show a tiny 0.10% rise for August, down from July’s 0.16%. But if that slowdown doesn’t show up, expect plenty of chatter about what it means for the Fed’s upcoming rate cut decisions. ",09-26-2024

# OpenAI CTO Mira Murati is leaving

After six-and-a-half years at OpenAI, CTO Mira Murati is stepping away. In a candid post on X (formerly Twitter), Murati said she’s taking time for “personal exploration.” But before she rides off into the sunset, her top priority is making sure the company transitions smoothly.

Murati, who led the development of ChatGPT and DALL-E, exits just ahead of OpenAI’s Dev Day conference—adding a bit of suspense to what’s already a high-stakes event.

**Big Shoes to Fill:** Murati’s departure is just the latest in a string of high-profile exits. Co-founders Ilya Sutskever and John Schulman, and Greg Brockman, have also left the company in recent months. While the details of Murati’s final day are still in the works, it’s clear her exit is shaking things up.

CEO Sam Altman didn’t hold back on praise, calling Murati’s contributions invaluable to both OpenAI’s mission and its internal culture. He teased that more details on the transition will be shared soon.

**OpenAI’s Next Move:** Murati’s exit couldn’t come at a more critical time. The company is in the middle of closing a $6.5 billion funding round, with backing from Microsoft, Nvidia, and Apple, among others. Meanwhile, competitors like Google and Anthropic (founded by ex-OpenAI talent) are circling, each looking to outpace OpenAI in the AI arms race.

**End of an Era:** Though Murati’s next steps are still a mystery, one thing’s for sure: she’s left an indelible mark on OpenAI’s trajectory. As the company moves forward, it will be interesting to see how they fill her shoes and keep pushing the boundaries of AI innovation.

# Micron’s AI Glow-Up

Micron Technology ($MU) is having a moment. The chipmaker’s stock shot up 14% in after-hours trading, all thanks to the AI hype train. With revenue for the upcoming quarter projected to hit between $8.5 billion and $8.9 billion—way above Wall Street’s $8.3 billion estimate—Micron’s riding the AI wave hard.

What’s driving the surge? Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM), a must-have for training AI systems, is selling out faster than concert tickets. It’s giving Micron a serious edge in the AI arms race.

**Blowing Past Expectations:** Micron didn’t just meet expectations—it crushed them. Q4 revenue came in at $7.75 billion, up a jaw-dropping 93% from last year and beating the $7.66 billion forecast. Earnings per share? $1.18, leaving analysts’ $1.11 prediction in the dust.

With AI demand sky-high, Micron’s boosting prices and locking down contracts for 2024 and 2025. And with that kind of momentum, 2025 is looking like a good year to be in the memory chip game.

**AI’s New Best Friend:** Micron’s memory chips are the cool kids in AI town, making them a key partner for Nvidia ($NVDA) as companies pour billions into AI hardware. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra even said, “We’re entering 2025 with the best competitive positioning in Micron’s history.” Big words, but so far, they’re backing it up.

# Back in Business

After a slump in demand for smartphones and PCs, Micron’s bouncing back. These devices are on the up, and with AI becoming a standard feature, they’re going to need more memory chips.

Translation: Micron’s got a lot to look forward to. Investors are clearly on board, and if AI keeps driving demand, this stock may have even more room to run.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow’s action starts with the weekly jobless claims report, which has become the go-to indicator for anyone trying to guess the Fed’s next move. With inflation on the backburner for now, the focus has shifted to how the labor market is holding up as the Fed walks the tightrope between employment and price stability.

Also, we’ve got the second revision of Q2 GDP coming in hot. The first revision showed 3% growth, and while this update probably won’t shake things up, it’ll give us another snapshot of the economy as the Fed mulls over its next rate cut. Oh, and if that’s not enough Fed news for you, eight Fed officials—including Jerome Powell—are hitting the mic tomorrow. Expect plenty of clues about where interest rates are headed next.

# Before Market Open:

* **Costco** ($COST) is riding high in 2024, with shares up nearly 40% as cash-strapped U.S. consumers flock to its bargain-packed aisles. The company’s no-frills, bulk-buying model has clearly paid off, delivering solid growth in both revenue and profits. But here’s the catch: everyone already knows this. With expectations sky-high ahead of tomorrow’s earnings report, any misstep could trigger a hefty selloff. Wall Street’s looking for $5.08 in EPS and $79.93 billion in revenue, so it’s all eyes on Costco to see if they can keep the momentum going.",09-26-2024

"How I Use Bookmap to EASILY Identify Entries and ExitsI've been day trading for 7 years and have been a consistently losing trader. Prior to a month ago, I purely used technical analysis and chart patterns to identify setups, and I would hold and hope for 3R winners. Inevitably, 70% of the time, the candlesticks would rollover and I'd lose.

The problem with candlesticks and indicators is that they only tell you what might happen based on previous data. The only way (in my opinion) to truly have an edge as a day trader is by understanding how to read real-time order flow.

I'm using Bookmap now and I'm consistently green. Bookmap is a data visualization tool for order flow. It provides the same data that's on Level 2, but in a visual format.

If you're an idiot like me, Level 2 moves too fast, so it's difficult to see where big blocks of passive orders are. Those passive orders act as Support and Resistance.

**Real World Example From Today:**

My strategy is to scan for highly liquid stocks that are trending at the Open and then add stocks with clear levels of large passive limit orders to my watchlist. 

Then, I wait to see what the stock does at those levels (Support or Resistance). If it breaks, I buy. If it fails, I sell. In the example below from today, you'll notice the HUGE wall of orders at $18. Once it rejected and closed in the red, I shorted it at $17.82, with my Stop loss at $18. I covered my short for profit at the Pre-Market High (Purple line.) There wasn't a wall of Buyers anywhere near by that could act as a clear level of Support, where price might bounce higher, so I got out at the pre-market high to play it safe. Once that level hit, momentum crept up and price went higher for the rest of the day. I had already made my money before the reversal, so I was good to go!

I think it's important to note, that Bookmap doesn't seem to work well for small cap momentum stocks, simply because there typically aren't large passive orders sitting on the DOM. I hate small caps anyway, so this doesn't bother me. Small caps is a game of musical chairs. It's high stakes gambling. Not for me.

Mega caps like Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, etc. are good ones. 

**How are you using Bookmap?**

I'd love to know if anyone else has any simple strategies for Bookmap that they'd like to share. I use the version that's built into Thinkorswim, so the capabilities are limited.

# Visa Gets Slapped with Antitrust Lawsuit

**What’s the Charge?** The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has Visa in its crosshairs, accusing the payment giant of illegally monopolizing the debit card market. According to the DOJ, Visa’s control over 60% of the $4 trillion debit transaction market has allowed them to bully merchants and tech rivals into submission. Think steep fees, restrictive contracts, and massive payouts to ensure no one else gets a slice of the pie.

**The Long Play:** This isn’t Visa’s first antitrust tango. The lawsuit follows a yearslong investigation that began after Visa tried to acquire fintech firm Plaid in 2021—a move the DOJ swiftly blocked. Visa’s alleged game plan? Pay off competitors like Apple, PayPal, and Block (formerly Square) to keep them from developing rival tech.

Attorney General Merrick Garland didn’t mince words: “Visa’s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing—but the price of nearly everything.”

**How’s Visa Feeling?** Visa’s General Counsel Julie Rottenberg fired back, calling the lawsuit “meritless” and reminding us all that Visa is just one player in a growing, competitive debit market. With a touch of PR spin, she added that Visa’s innovations help consumers—though, maybe not their wallets.

**Bigger Picture** This case is part of the Biden administration’s broader crackdown on industry giants that dominate markets. Visa’s been here before, but this time, the DOJ is coming for their debit throne. With over $7 billion in annual swipe fees on the line, Visa's legal defense is shaping up to be just as costly.

Meanwhile, Visa shares? Down 5%. 

If Visa loses, it could mean lower transaction fees for merchants and more competition in the payment space. But the fight won’t end anytime soon—expect this case to stretch over the next few years. And who knows, a new administration may have different ideas. Either way, Visa’s dominance might finally meet its match.

# Bank Of China’s Stimulus: Band-Aid on a Broken Leg

China just launched its biggest economic stimulus since the pandemic, and while it sent Chinese stocks soaring, it’s more of a temporary fix than a real solution. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cut interest rates, loosened bank reserve requirements, and rolled out new housing incentives to give the economy a boost.

But here’s the problem: cheap credit alone won’t fix China’s deep-rooted economic issues.

**Stock Market Sugar Rush:** Let’s start with the bright spot—Chinese stocks had a stellar day. JD. com, Alibaba, and PDD Holdings (yep, Temu’s parent company) saw double-digit gains, lifting the CSI 300 index by 4.33%, its biggest surge in four years. Sounds promising, right? Well, hold up—despite that pop, the CSI 300 is still down around 1% for the year, while the S&P 500 is up 21%. So while China’s market caught a break, Wall Street’s still winning the race.

**Property Market in Freefall:** The real issue here is China’s property market, which has gone from being a powerhouse to a sinkhole. Once accounting for a third of the economy, it’s now in a freefall, with prices continuing to drop and developers collapsing into bankruptcy. Beijing’s previous efforts to revive the market haven’t worked, and this latest push—lowering down payments on second homes to 15% and expanding loan guarantees—probably won’t either.

Here’s the kicker: only 11% of urban Chinese think home prices will rise next quarter. For context, that’s about as optimistic as expecting Blockbuster to make a comeback.

**Cheap Credit Won’t Cut It:** Sure, Beijing’s stimulus will provide a short-term jolt to stocks and housing, but it’s not a long-term fix. Throwing more credit at the economy won’t solve the underlying problem: a lack of private-sector innovation. Instead, the government is using financial tricks like subsidizing stock buybacks and offering cheap liquidity to institutional investors.

What China really needs is to loosen its grip on private businesses. But Xi Jinping’s ongoing crackdown on tech companies and private enterprises has left lasting scars. Until Beijing gives entrepreneurs the freedom to innovate, all this stimulus is like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Get ready for another housing update tomorrow, this time with a focus on shiny new single-family homes. This report is key because it gives us a peek into how many homes were sold and at what price.

In July, new home sales hit 739,000, up 5.6% from the previous year, but economists expect August sales to cool off to around 700,000. One thing that probably won’t cool? Home prices. The median price for a new home spiked to $429,800 in July, a four-month high, and unless supply picks up, that number isn’t budging anytime soon.

# After Market Close:

* **Micron Technology** ($MU) might have cooled off since its peak in mid-June, but it's far from out of the game. The demand for its chips is still going strong, even if the buzz has quieted down, and the current dip in its stock price could be a prime value play. The consensus for the upcoming report? $1.13 in earnings per share and $7.63 billion in revenue.",09-24-2024

"Looking for Advice I literally can’t find a Broker

Hey everyone, I have a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice.

A friend of mine from Libya is getting into day trading. When he first started learning, he researched brokers that support Libya, but didn’t find any good options. I encouraged him to keep learning and suggested Interactive Brokers since they are well-known for being global and offering a wide range of stocks. 

Yesterday, he reached out, frustrated, saying he went through almost every broker he could find, and none of them support Libya. After digging into it, we pinpointed the issue.

The brokers that *do* support Libya, like AvaTrade or AvaFutures, are often considered scams by the community, or other ones such as Exness that only deal with forex and high-cap CFDs like Apple or Microsoft. The problem is, when we use stock screeners for medium-cap stocks that he’d actually want to trade, they’re not available on any of the platforms he can access.

So far, we’ve looked at platforms like Exness, XM, Tickmill, AvaTrade, and other (more than 10 brokers). None of them focus on medium-cap stocks or have a good selection. Most of them market big names like Apple and Nvidia,and so on. He doesn’t have the capital to trade these, nor is he proficient enough to tackle those stocks.

He’s now asking me what to do since he doesn’t want to trade instruments like forex, and after hours of research, it seems like no solid futures or stock trading platforms support Libya.

Any advice or recommendations for brokers that could support him would be greatly appreciated!",09-23-2024

"Stock Market Today 09/20/2024: Microsoft Powers Up AI With a Nuclear Comeback at Three Mile Island + Qualcomm Wants to Buy Intel# MARKETS 

* U.S. stocks had a mixed close on Friday as the rate-cut excitement fizzled out. The Dow inched up, barely squeezing out a record close at 42,063. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 took a 0.19% dip, and the Nasdaq didn’t fare much better, slipping by 0.36%.
* Still, the markets managed to wrap up the week with some solid gains, thanks to Thursday’s rally. Investors were all smiles after Fed Chair Jerome Powell clarified that the recent rate cut was aimed at supporting the economy—not rescuing it. Add in some positive jobless claims data, and Thursday’s optimism carried over, even if Friday was a bit of a snooze.

# Microsoft Powers Up AI With a Nuclear Comeback at Three Mile Island

Well, this is one headline we didn’t see coming. Microsoft is so hungry for energy to fuel its AI ambitions, it’s partnering with Constellation Energy to bring back the Three Mile Island nuclear plant — yes, the site of the *worst nuclear accident* in U.S. history. Constellation plans to invest $1.6 billion to reboot the plant’s Unit 1 reactor by 2028, and Microsoft has signed a 20-year deal to buy every watt of power it churns out. Looks like AI isn't just demanding your data — it needs a *whole lot* of juice too.

**What's the Deal?** Constellation, the U.S.'s biggest nuclear operator, plans to turn the once-shuttered Three Mile Island reactor into the Crane Clean Energy Center (a posthumous nod to former Exelon CEO Chris Crane). This marks a major milestone for both companies: Microsoft locks in a reliable, carbon-free energy source to fuel its AI data centers, while Constellation revives an aging reactor that couldn't compete with cheap natural gas and renewables. With AI's skyrocketing power demands, tech giants are scrambling for steady, green electricity.

**A Nuclear Renaissance:** This move taps into a broader trend: nuclear energy's comeback. After a wave of plant closures over the past decade, power-hungry industries like AI and EVs are driving renewed interest in these reactors. Nuclear plants, unlike wind and solar, run 24/7 — perfect for data centers that never sleep. Other tech giants like Amazon and Oracle are also turning to nuclear to keep up with their massive energy needs.

**But It’s Not All Glowing...**  Rebooting a reactor isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. The plant needs major upgrades to its cooling system, turbine, and transformer, and still faces a long queue for grid connection approval from PJM Interconnection, the local grid operator. Plus, it’s got to pass stringent safety checks from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If everything goes smoothly (fingers crossed), Three Mile Island could be back online as soon as 2027.

**Looking Ahead:** AI is reshaping the world — and the energy grid along with it. As data centers keep popping up and consuming ever more electricity, the demand for clean, continuous power will only increase. Whether this sparks a true nuclear revival or just a few isolated reboots remains to be seen, but one thing’s clear: Microsoft is betting on nuclear to fuel its AI-driven future.

Brace yourselves, we might just be entering the **AI-powered nuclear age**.

# Qualcomm Wants to Buy Intel

Things are heating up in Silicon Valley! Qualcomm, best known for its mobile chip domination, is reportedly eyeing Intelfor a possible takeover, according to insiders. If successful, this would not only be one of the largest tech deals ever but could also mark a major shift in the semiconductor industry. Intel, once the top dog, has been *sputtering* with a steep 60% stock drop this year, while Qualcomm is ready to make moves.

**The Plot Thickens:** Intel’s got a lot on its plate – a major $1.6 billion loss this past quarter, layoffs, and restructuring, all while its market value plummeted from $290 billion in 2020 to around $90 billion. Talk about a fall from grace! Despite its struggles, Qualcomm sees a potential golden ticket in Intel's PC and server chip dominance, which could complement its own strength in smartphone chips.

But don’t start popping the champagne yet—this deal is far from certain. There’s always a little thing called antitrust scrutiny that could trip things up. Plus, Qualcomm might have to offload parts of Intel to make it work. Hey, no one said buying a $90 billion company would be easy.

**Why Intel?** For decades, Intel reigned supreme as the largest semiconductor company, but the rise of rivals like AMD, Broadcom, and NVIDIA has left the company in a tough spot. Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has been on a three-year turnaround mission, but things haven’t exactly gone according to plan. Their recent efforts include trying to spin off their manufacturing business and landing a deal with Amazon for custom AI semiconductors. Still, Intel is struggling to regain its footing.

On the other side, Qualcomm has been expanding beyond smartphones, recently re-entering the desktop processormarket, especially with AI integration. This could make Intel's x86 chips an ideal addition to Qualcomm's arsenal.

# Looking Ahead

If this deal goes through, it could shake up the global chip game. Qualcomm might finally get the manufacturing muscleit’s been outsourcing, but it’s a risky bet. Intel’s manufacturing issues are notorious, and fixing them is no small task. Plus, the deal would set the stage for a massive showdown between Qualcomm’s ARM chips and Intel’s x86 architecture—a battle that could reshape the industry.

# Nike Shakes It Up — CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who’s stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe’s last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :** Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy’s in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike’s ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:** With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He’s expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development—areas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill’s return is also a shot of morale for the company’s workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike’s upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe’s Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It’s not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that’s exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share—but the board wasn’t feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she’s now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company’s stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you’ve taken a DNA test, there’s not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What’s Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it’s a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company’s been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned—23andMe’s future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx’s Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a “challenging quarter” as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx’s premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren’t thrilled, and FedEx wasn’t the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market’s growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:** FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share—down from $22. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street’s $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company’s merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven’t quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:** Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn’t helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

Moderna’s getting out the scissors. The biotech giant announced plans to cut its R&D budget by $1.1 billion over the next three years as it faces the harsh reality of slumping vaccine sales. The company is pulling the plug on five programs and slowing down late-stage trials to rein in costs. Translation: it’s aiming to survive the post-COVID world by focusing on 10 key product launches by 2027. But there’s a catch—Moderna’s break-even target just got pushed back two years, from 2026 to 2028.

**Investors to Moderna: Not Impressed**  
Wall Street took one look at that plan and said, “Nope.” Shares tanked over 12%, marking a rough day for a stock that’s already down 20% this year. While Moderna claims it’s exercising ""financial discipline"" by scaling back, investors are skeptical. They’re wondering if this is less about discipline and more about desperation. The company’s revenue projections for next year didn’t help either, coming in way below analysts' expectations. Some are questioning whether Moderna can make it to 2028 without asking for more cash from shareholders.

**So, What’s Next?**  
Moderna is betting big on 10 new products, with vaccines for flu, RSV, and a combo flu-COVID shot leading the charge. The company’s pipeline also includes some cancer treatments, but fast-tracking those approvals has hit a snag with regulators. Still, Moderna is pushing forward, expecting these new launches to drive growth. However, don’t expect any major cash infusions until at least 2025—revenue contributions from these new products are likely a couple of years away.

**The Bigger Picture**  
This isn’t just about tightening the belt. Moderna’s once high-flying COVID vaccine sales have fallen to earth, forcing the company to recalibrate. Its COVID cash cow dried up faster than expected, and competition in the vaccine space is heating up. Now, the company is left navigating a landscape that’s looking a lot less certain. CEO Stéphane Bancel insists that they won’t need to raise equity, but investors aren’t convinced.

  
Moderna’s “pivot” may sound like a savvy long-term strategy, but in the short term, it’s raising a lot of eyebrows. With revenue projections looking iffy and product launches still a few years out, the biotech darling has some convincing to do if it wants to regain Wall Street’s trust. Until then, it’s all about survival—and cutting those R&D costs is just the beginning.

# Oracle’s Big Cloud Dreams — $104 Billion Sales by 2029

Oracle has its eyes on the clouds… and a lot of cash. The software giant just upped its forecast, predicting at least $104 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029, thanks to the rapid growth of its cloud infrastructure business. This ambitious target was laid out by Executive VP Doug Kehring during Oracle’s annual analyst briefing, where the company also raised its fiscal 2026 sales outlook to $66 billion, beating analyst estimates by $1.5 billion.

**Cloud Wars Heating Up**  
Oracle’s game plan? Keep expanding its cloud services to compete with the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The company has been gaining traction in cloud infrastructure, particularly with generative AI workloads, boasting high-profile clients like Elon Musk’s xAI. Oracle’s strategy also includes making its database software easier to run on rival platforms—a move it hopes will help migrate its on-premise customers to the cloud, a key pillar of its growth strategy.

**The Numbers Game**  
Oracle’s stock is having a banner year, up 55% so far, trailing only Nvidia among the tech giants. Shares jumped another 6% following the updated revenue forecast, capping off a good week that saw the stock surge 15% over three trading sessions. CEO Safra Catz was confident about hitting these targets, citing partnerships with cloud heavyweights like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to help boost Oracle’s cloud revenue, which has already grown by 45% in the latest quarter.

**Eyes on AI**  
Oracle’s not just riding the cloud wave—it’s betting big on AI, too. The company announced it’s taking orders for a massive cluster of Nvidia’s next-gen GPUs, which could solidify its place in the AI race. And as capital expenditures are set to double in fiscal 2025, Oracle’s banking on both cloud and AI to keep the revenue train rolling.

# Adobe’s AI Ambitions Stumble — Guidance Misses Mark

# By the Numbers:

* **$5.5B - $5.55B**: Adobe's revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, falling short of analysts’ $5.6B expectations.
* **8%**: Adobe’s drop in extended trading after the guidance miss.
* **11%**: Increase in third-quarter revenue to $5.41B.
* **$4.65**: Adobe’s third-quarter profit per share, beating estimates of $4.53.
* **$550M**: Net new digital media subscriptions, slightly below the $561M forecast.

Adobe has been busy rolling out AI tools like Firefly in its creative software, but investors are still waiting for that AI magic to show up in the company’s numbers. On Thursday, the software giant reported revenue for the upcoming quarter that fell short of Wall Street’s lofty expectations. The company expects revenue between $5.5 billion and $5.55 billion, slightly below the $5.6 billion analysts had predicted. In after-hours trading, the stock dropped 8%, leaving investors unimpressed.

**Strong Results, But Not Strong Enough**  
Adobe’s third-quarter numbers weren’t bad by any stretch—sales jumped 11% to $5.41 billion, and profit topped estimates at $4.65 per share. The company’s core digital media business, which includes its AI-infused Creative Cloud, also grew 11%. However, guidance for the fourth quarter disappointed, leaving many to wonder when the much-hyped AI features will start meaningfully boosting revenue.

**AI Hype vs. Reality**  
Adobe has been aggressively adding AI capabilities to its software lineup, hoping to cash in on the generative AI trend. But investors were banking on seeing bigger results by now, and the slower-than-expected adoption of AI tools like Firefly has some worried. Competitors like Canva have already hiked prices for AI features, putting pressure on Adobe to follow suit—although such changes could take quarters, if not years, to fully materialize.

**Price Hikes and Patience**  
Adobe is looking for ways to monetize its AI features, but price increases for its software take time to roll out to all customers. Meanwhile, its key metric of net new digital media subscriptions came in at $550 million, slightly below estimates, adding to investor jitters. Despite all the hype surrounding AI, Adobe’s leadership insists the company is just scratching the surface of what these innovations can do.

**The Takeaway**  
For now, it seems Adobe’s AI-driven future is more about potential than actual results. With shares down 8% after the guidance miss, investors are growing impatient for the promised AI uplift. As the company continues to invest in generative AI, the question remains: when will it start paying off in a big way?

# Apple’s $14 Billion Bite: EU Wins Big

# Apple’s Tax Drama Ends in Defeat

Apple just faced a crushing blow in its decade-long tax battle. The European Union’s top court upheld the tech giant’s €13 billion ($14.4 billion) tax bill in Ireland, a case that’s been brewing since 2016. At the heart of it, Apple was accused of getting sweetheart tax deals from Ireland—a violation of EU state-aid rules. The ruling is a major win for the EU, specifically for Margrethe Vestager, its outgoing antitrust chief, who’s spent her tenure targeting Big Tech with a vengeance.

While Apple isn’t thrilled—Tim Cook once called the whole thing “total political crap”—it’s now staring down a hefty $10 billion tax charge for its fiscal fourth quarter. Ireland, which denied giving any special treatment, must now figure out what to do with that massive windfall, currently chilling in an escrow account. With this decision, Apple’s hopes of escaping the EU’s tax net have officially fizzled.

This isn’t Apple’s first run-in with the EU. Vestager has long had the company in her crosshairs, accusing them of taking advantage of Europe’s low corporate tax rates while reaping billions in revenue. While Apple argues that it pays its fair share wherever it operates, the EU views this as a clear case of tax avoidance, and this victory sets a strong precedent. Moving forward, other Big Tech firms like Amazon may want to watch their backs as the EU sharpens its focus on leveling the tax playing field.

# Who is Vestager?

Margrethe Vestager isn’t just any bureaucrat—she’s the EU’s competition czar and a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley giants. As the European Commission's executive vice president for competition since 2014, she’s made it her mission to hold tech behemoths accountable for their market dominance and questionable tax practices. Apple, Google, Amazon—you name it, she’s probably fined them. Vestager’s nickname “Tax Lady” (courtesy of Donald Trump) reflects her relentless pursuit of fairness, particularly when it comes to leveling the playing field for European companies against global titans. Her bold approach has made her a hero in some circles and a nightmare in others, but her departure from the Commission leaves a legacy of major wins against Big Tech.

# Google’s Not Laughing Either

Not to be left out, Google also felt the sting of the EU’s iron fist. The court upheld a €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) fine against the search giant for unfairly promoting its own shopping service in search results. The penalty, originally slapped on Google in 2017, marked the beginning of a series of fines that now total more than €8 billion ($8.5 billion). Despite changes Google made years ago to appease regulators, the court's ruling reinforces the EU’s determination to keep Big Tech in check.

While Google is ""disappointed"" with the decision, the EU is riding high on its tech crackdown, hoping that the Digital Markets Act (DMA) will be the final nail in the coffin for self-preferencing. The law, passed last year, seeks to curb the dominance of giants like Google and Apple. As Vestager put it, “No one is above the law”—and it seems she’s making good on that promise.

In short, Apple’s tax break? Gone. Google’s search dominance? Under fire. The EU isn’t backing down, and this week, the Silicon Valley giants were the latest to feel the heat.

# Inflation Cools, But Core's Still Hot

The inflation train has finally hit a cooling station—kind of. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices rose just 0.2% in August, bringing the year-over-year inflation rate down to 2.5%, the lowest since early 2021. *Cue cautious optimism.* But before you start popping the champagne, core inflation (which excludes those pesky volatile items like food and energy) came in a tad higher than expected, rising 0.3%. The housing market was the main culprit here, with shelter prices climbing their fastest all year.

This means the Fed has some tough choices to make. Wall Street was hoping for a bolder 50 basis point rate cut next week, but with core inflation still sticky, traders are now betting on a more modest 25 basis point reduction. Don’t expect the Fed to let up entirely on inflation just yet—they’ll likely be playing defense for a while longer.

# What This Means for the Fed (and You)

Despite the mixed inflation signals, the market actually took the news in stride. Stocks wobbled at first but bounced back to end the day in the green, and Treasury yields remained near year-long lows. Traders are pricing in an 85% chance of a quarter-point rate cut when the Fed wraps up its meeting on September 18, with expectations for even more rate cuts through the end of the year.

But what’s the Fed’s game plan from here? Jerome Powell and company are still threading the needle between taming inflation and preventing a slowdown in the job market, which has already cooled significantly. With unemployment on the rise and wage growth slowing, the Fed has to balance its rate cuts carefully to avoid tipping the economy into a full-on recession. So, while inflation may be losing steam, the bigger question is: How low will rates go before the Fed hits pause?

# Consumer Prices: A Mixed Bag

Not all prices are following inflation’s cooling trend. Housing costs, which make up a third of the CPI, were up 0.5%, accounting for a whopping 70% of the core inflation increase. On the flip side, energy prices fell by 0.8%, while used vehicle prices dipped 1%. Medical services were down 0.1%, but don’t get too comfortable—egg prices soared 4.8%, and airline fares jumped nearly 4%.

All of this points to a mixed picture for consumers, who are still feeling the squeeze in certain areas despite overall price moderation. Real earnings rose 0.2% in August, outpacing inflation for the month, but households are still dealing with much higher prices for goods and services than before the pandemic.

So, what's next? Keep your eyes peeled for more rate cuts by year-end as the Fed continues its balancing act between inflation and economic slowdown. Oh, and maybe rethink that fall getaway—airline prices aren’t getting any cheaper.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

After checking off the Consumer Price Index, it’s time to give some love to the Producer Price Index (PPI). While CPI tells us what you’re paying at the checkout line, PPI tracks what producers are getting for their goods—basically, retail vs. wholesale inflation.

PPI rose a modest 0.1% last month, falling short of the 0.2% economists expected. On an annual scale, it slid to 2.2%, down from June’s 2.7%. Meanwhile, core PPI (excluding those pesky food and energy costs) was flat, which forecasters hope will remain the case this month.

Also, keep an eye on the weekly initial jobless claims report. With the Fed zeroing in on the labor market, this data could be key to guessing whether we’re headed toward another interest rate hike.

# Glowtime Unveiled — Apple’s Big Event Recap

Apple’s ""It’s Glowtime"" event has come and gone, leaving us with some shiny (slightly same) new toys to obsess over. The iPhone 16 lineup took the spotlight, with a slew of features that scream AI-powered future. Let’s dive into the highlights.

**iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Pro Max:** The iPhone 16 lineup stole the show, featuring generative AI capabilities and the new Camera Control button, which lets you snap photos, perform searches, and identify objects in real-time using Apple’s Visual Intelligence. The Pro models (6.3"" and 6.9"") come with bigger screens, thinner bezels, a faster A18 chip, and improved battery life. Both the Pro and Pro Max now let you shoot 4K video at 120 fps, ideal for cinematic slow-motion shots. The iPhone 16 models start at $799 and are available for pre-order starting Friday, with a September 20 launch.

**AirPods 4 & AirPods Max:** Apple introduced the AirPods 4 in two versions: a standard model at $129 and a higher-end version at $179 that includes active noise cancellation (ANC) and transparency mode. The charging case is smaller and supports USB-C. Plus, there’s an updated AirPods Max, now with USB-C charging and some fresh colors. Both models aim for a more comfortable fit with refined contours and better sound quality.

**Apple Watch Series 10:** The 10th-generation Apple Watch is the thinnest and lightest yet, with a 40% brighter display and larger screen sizes (42mm and 46mm). It also comes packed with new features, including sleep apnea detection (pending FDA approval), and it can charge up to 80% in just 30 minutes. The Series 10 starts at $399 and is available for pre-order, with a release on September 20.

**Faster MagSafe Charger:** Apple revealed a new, more powerful 25W MagSafe charger compatible with all iPhones and Qi2 devices. Only the iPhone 16 models, however, support the full 25W charging rate, giving Apple an edge over competitors like Samsung and Google.

**iOS 18:** Launching next week, iOS 18 brings exciting updates like homescreen and lockscreen customizations, a redesigned Control Center, and satellite messaging. It also introduces a new password management app and revamped Photos and Mail apps.

Apple’s “It’s Glowtime” event brought some cool updates, but it still left many consumers wanting more. While the iPhone 16 lineup added a flashy Camera Control button and a few AI tricks, the overall design and features feel like minor tweaks compared to last year’s models. Even the Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4 saw incremental upgrades, with the usual improvements in size, battery life, and sound. Sure, the new tech is nice, but nothing felt truly groundbreaking—leaving Apple fans wondering when the next big leap is coming.

# Cloud Expansion Powers Growth

Oracle’s cloud business is firing on all cylinders, with its cloud infrastructure segment growing by a stunning 45% in the fiscal first quarter. Cloud services now make up the company's largest business, and demand is particularly strong for Oracle's generative AI solutions. The company has been signing up big-name customers like Elon Musk’s xAI and Reka, driving demand for AI-driven workloads.

Oracle isn’t stopping there. On Monday, it announced a major new agreement to bring its database services to Amazon Web Services (AWS), adding to previous partnerships with Microsoft and Google. Analysts view this move as a significant step in modernizing Oracle’s database business, which has traditionally been on-premise. CEO Safra Catz emphasized how these deals are helping Oracle solidify its place in the competitive cloud market.

# Big Investments, Bigger Growth Ahead

Looking ahead, Safra Catz predicts even bigger growth, forecasting double-digit revenue increases for the fiscal year ending in May 2025. To support this growth, Oracle is doubling down on cloud infrastructure, with capital expenditureshitting $2.3 billion in the last quarter and plans to double that investment by next year to keep up with demand for cloud servers.

Oracle is also expanding its global footprint, with 162 data centers in operation or under construction worldwide. The company is racing to meet the growing need for cloud infrastructure, especially for AI workloads, and its investments in this space are expected to drive continued growth.

With Oracle’s stock already up 33% this year, the company’s aggressive cloud expansion and strategic partnerships position it for long-term success. Oracle is no longer just the database giant it once was—it’s becoming a key player in the cloud and AI revolution, competing with the biggest names in tech and setting itself up for sustained growth in the years ahead.

The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index isn’t exactly the star of the financial show, and it doesn’t usually move markets. But with the economy under the microscope and the Fed on high alert for any slowdown signals, it’s worth keeping tabs on how small businesses—aka the backbone of the economy—are holding up.

On another note, tomorrow’s second presidential debate between former President Trump and VP Kamala Harris is likely to steal the spotlight. While it’s not market-specific, you can bet investors will be tuning in, hoping to catch a glimpse of the candidates’ economic game plans.

The tech sector took the hardest hit, with the Nasdaq falling over 2.5%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones slipped 1.7% and 1%, respectively. The S&P 500 recorded its worst week since March, largely driven by a selloff in leading technology stocks.

# August Jobs Report: Not Great, Not Terrible

It looks like the Fed has some tough choices to make after August’s jobs report hit with a “meh” response. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs—better than July’s nerve-wracking numbers but not the blowout people were hoping for. The unemployment rate also dipped a little to 4.2%, which might calm some nerves but doesn’t answer the big question: Will the Fed cut rates by a quarter-point or go bold with a half-point?

# What Happened?

The Fed’s been itching to cut rates, especially after June and July’s job growth took a nosedive. But Friday’s report was like a Goldilocks situation—not too hot, not too cold. The headline numbers weren’t weak enough to scream “emergency,” but downward revisions to the summer months suggest things aren’t looking as strong as they seemed.

Here’s what we know:

* **Job growth**: 142,000 in August, following revised numbers from June and July, which showed 86,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
* **Unemployment**: A modest dip to 4.2%.
* **Wage growth**: Hourly earnings ticked up 3.8% year-over-year, a small silver lining for workers.

# Fed's Dilemma: 25 or 50?

With the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 18, central bankers are torn between two options:

* **The safe bet**: Cut rates by 25 basis points to keep things steady and avoid rocking the boat.
* **The bold move**: Go for a 50 basis point cut to really send a message and juice the economy. Some argue that the summer hiring slowdown justifies this.

So, what’s the vibe on Wall Street? Uncertainty. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7% on Friday, marking its worst week in 18 months. The bond market also reacted with 10-year Treasury yields dipping to their lowest point in over a year.

# Fed Speak

Fed Governor Christopher Waller hinted that a sequence of cuts is likely but didn’t give a clear signal on whether they’ll go for the big 50 basis point cut just yet. Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams remained non-committal, saying he didn’t have a firm view on the size of the cut.

In short, the Fed’s in a wait-and-see mode, leaving markets jittery heading into September.

# What’s Next?

While August’s job report wasn’t a disaster, it didn’t exactly boost confidence, either. Economists are now looking ahead to see if the Fed will play it safe with a smaller cut or go for a bigger move to jumpstart the economy. Whatever happens, it’s going to keep markets on their toes.

# Selena Gomez Joins the Billionaire Club

Selena Gomez has officially entered the billionaire club, and it's not from breaking records on the Billboard charts. Her beauty brand, Rare Beauty, has turned the 32-year-old actress, singer, and entrepreneur into one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the U.S., with a fortune of $1.3 billion, according to Bloomberg. But don’t be fooled—this success story goes way beyond a pop star simply slapping her name on some lip gloss.

# The Rare Billionaire Formula

The vast bulk of Selena's wealth—around $1.1 billion—comes from her 51% stake in Rare Beauty, the makeup line she launched in 2020. It’s a brand that hit big with influencers and Gen Z, generating $350 million in revenue last year. Rare Beauty isn't just another celeb-founded brand; it’s become a beauty powerhouse, outshining competitors like Jessica Alba’s Honest Co. and Lady Gaga’s Haus Labs. What makes it stand out? For starters, Selena marketed it as affordable, high-quality, and inclusive, with a message that celebrates authenticity. No wonder it’s selling out faster than her concert tickets.

But it’s not all about making bank. Rare Beauty donates 1% of its sales to the Rare Impact Fund, which aims to raise $100 million over the next decade to support mental health services. The fund is deeply personal to Gomez, who has been candid about her own struggles with bipolar disorder. This combination of purpose-driven business and beauty innovation has not only cemented Rare Beauty’s place in the market but also earned Gomez a loyal customer base.

# Diversifying Her Empire

While Rare Beauty is the crown jewel of her portfolio, Selena is far from a one-trick pony. She’s got her hands in several pots, and it’s paying off big time. Her mental health startup, Wondermind, which she co-founded with her mom and Daniella Pierson of *The Newsette*, was valued at $100 million in 2022. It’s backed by investors like Sequoia Capital and Serena Williams’s venture fund. Wondermind is all about providing accessible mental health tools and resources, and it fits neatly into Selena’s broader mission of mental health advocacy.

Then there’s her acting career, which is booming. Selena stars alongside comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short in *Only Murders in the Building*, raking in at least $6 million per season. The Hulu hit just kicked off its fourth season, and Selena’s performance as the quirky, mysterious Mabel Mora has earned her an Emmy nomination. While she may have started her career as a Disney darling, Selena’s acting chops and producing gigs (she’s also an executive producer on the show) are proving she’s got serious staying power in Hollywood.

# Brand Partnerships and Social Media Power

When Selena’s not in front of the camera or overseeing Rare Beauty, she’s leveraging her massive social media following—424 million Instagram followers, making her the third most followed person on the platform, trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. That digital clout has scored her major brand deals. She inked a $30 million deal with Puma and a $10 million contract with Coach. These partnerships, combined with her music royalties and acting roles, have only added to her ever-growing fortune.

What’s fascinating is that while Selena’s music career helped launch her into the public eye, it’s not a major source of her wealth. Unlike her friend Taylor Swift, who owns much of her songwriting catalog, Selena’s music earnings come primarily from performance royalties. Her last tour was back in 2016, and while it raked in $30 million, music accounts for less than 5% of her total net worth. Smart move? Absolutely. Selena has built a diversified empire that isn’t tied to the volatile ups and downs of the music industry.

# Building a Legacy

So, what’s next for Selena? For now, she’s keeping her focus on acting and business, hinting that while she might have one more album in her, her passion lies elsewhere. “I would probably choose acting,” she revealed on a recent episode of the *SmartLess* podcast. She’s also expanding her empire into new projects, including executive producing a reboot of her Disney Channel hit *Wizards of Waverly Place*.

And let’s not forget the potential growth of Rare Beauty. While Selena has fielded offers to sell the brand, including a reported $2 billion valuation, she’s publicly said she has no plans to let go of her beauty baby anytime soon. Given Rare’s rapid rise and staying power, she might be right to hold on and ride the wave.

Selena’s success isn’t just a stroke of good luck—it’s a carefully crafted blend of talent, business savvy, and authenticity. She’s created multiple revenue streams, invested in long-term ventures, and built a brand that resonates deeply with her fans. At just 32, she’s already established herself as a mogul in the beauty industry and beyond.

# The Rare Takeaway

Selena Gomez’s ascent to billionaire status is proof that being a multi-hyphenate pays off—literally. While her journey started as a child star on *Barney & Friends* and Disney’s *Wizards of Waverly Place*, she’s grown into a force to be reckoned with, using her platform to not only build a fortune but to also promote causes she cares deeply about. Rare Beauty is much more than a makeup brand; it’s a testament to her vision, resilience, and commitment to being authentic, both on and off the screen.

Her next chapter? Whatever it is, it’s sure to be *rare* and profitable.

# Next Week

Next week’s lineup is looking pretty light, but there’s one report that’s got everyone buzzing.

On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) drops, and it’s a big one. CPI is the go-to inflation gauge, and whatever it shows could nudge the Federal Reserve toward its next move. Last month, inflation rose 2.9% over the past year—the smallest jump since March 2021. If the cooling trend continues, it’ll give the Fed even more reason to consider cutting rates later this month.

And while earnings season is wrapping up, there are still a few stragglers worth watching. Keep your eyes peeled.

# Worst Month for Stocks: September

Ah, September—the month when Halloween decorations start creeping onto store shelves, and if you’re a stock market investor, a time when your portfolio might give you a scare. Historically, September has been a nightmare for Wall Street, and 2024 is shaping up to be just as spooky.

# A Historical Downer

Let’s get straight to the point: September tends to suck for stocks. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJIA) dips 1.51%, the S&P 500 ($SPX) drops 2.12%, the Nasdaq Composite ($COMP) falls 3.26%, and the Russell 2000 ($RUT) slides 3.09%. And these numbers aren't just random blips—they reflect over a century of data. It’s like Groundhog Day, but instead of six more weeks of winter, you get a month of losses.

If that wasn’t enough to make you want to close your brokerage account and head for the hills, bond investors don’t fare much better. The iShares U.S. Treasury bond ETF ($GOVT), which tracks the broad U.S. government bond market, typically has its worst month in September too. This is the part where you cue the sad trombone.

# So, Why the Gloom?

Why does September get such a bad rap? Analysts have a few theories. After a summer of sand and sun, traders return to their desks and start to reassess their portfolios, which often means selling off high-fliers. Plus, companies begin thinking about their year-end financials, making it a prime time to offload some winners to balance out the losers. It’s like a spring cleaning—only, you know, in the fall.

But it’s not all bad news. Stocks actually finished August strong, buoyed by surprisingly robust economic data that calmed fears about a faltering job market. And with the Federal Reserve likely to start cutting interest rates for the first time in four years at their next meeting on September 18, there’s a sliver of hope that things could turn around.

Adding to the uncertainty, the August jobs report is due out on September 6. If it disappoints, we could see another selloff like we did last month when the July numbers came in lower than expected.

And let’s not forget about the looming presidential election and the ongoing tension in the Middle East, which could escalate into a full-blown conflict involving major oil producers like Iran and Saudi Arabia.

# The Bright Side?

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that gold and the U.S. dollar—two traditional safe havens—have historically performed better in September. So, while stocks might be in for a rough ride, there are still places to park your money if you’re feeling scared.

# Disney vs. DirecTV: What’s Going On? 

DirecTV subscribers might want to double-check their TV listings this week because ESPN, Disney, ABC, and a host of other channels just vanished. Yep, you read that right—Disney pulled its programming from DirecTV, including streaming services like Hulu, due to a contract dispute.

# What Happened?

The blackout happened at a pretty inconvenient time for sports fans. With the new college football season in full swing and the U.S. Open tennis tournament heating up, DirecTV viewers were left hanging. ESPN cut out during fourth-round U.S. Open matches at 7:20 p.m. ET, and just minutes before a big football game between LSU and USC. Needless to say, fans were not happy, flooding social media with complaints.

DirecTV is the third-largest pay TV provider in the U.S., with 11.3 million customers who suddenly have a lot less to watch. The main sticking point? Carriage fees—the amount DirecTV pays Disney to carry its channels. DirecTV wants more flexibility in choosing which channels to offer its customers, while Disney is pushing for a bundled approach that would keep all their channels together, which typically costs subscribers more.

# Why the Blackout?

At its core, this dispute is about money—surprise, surprise. DirecTV argues that Disney is being anti-consumer by insisting on bundled packages that drive up costs. For example, ESPN's monthly fee has jumped to about $10, up 40% from $7.19 in 2019. DirecTV’s CFO, Ray Carpenter, claims customers are tired of these ""bloated packages"" that force them to pay for channels they don’t watch. Disney, on the other hand, says it’s not going to sign any deals that undervalue its content.

# When Will This End?

Unfortunately, no one knows when the channels will be back. Blackouts like these can last anywhere from a few days to several years, depending on how quickly both parties can reach an agreement. DirecTV is giving its customers a $20 credit as a consolation, but that’s cold comfort for sports fans missing out on their favorite games.

# What Can You Do?

If you’re a DirecTV subscriber missing out on Disney’s channels, you have some options. You could switch to a streaming service like YouTube TV or Hulu Plus Live TV, both of which offer Disney’s full lineup. Just be prepared to shell out between $73 and $80 a month, depending on the service.

In the meantime, keep your fingers crossed that Disney and DirecTV can sort this out before the next big game or episode of your favorite show.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week is packed with key labor market data, starting with tomorrow's release of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS report provides a snapshot of the previous month’s job openings, hires, and separations (like layoffs and retirements) across the U.S. It's a critical indicator of labor market health, especially the job openings figure, which sheds light on the demand for workers.

The previous JOLTS data showed little change, with job openings at 8.18 million—down by 941,000 from a year ago—while the job openings rate held steady at 4.9%. For the upcoming report, economists expect the number of job openings to be slightly lower, around 8.09 million, which isn't expected to cause much concern in the markets.

The Dow Jones ticked up 0.55%, hitting yet another record, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq climbed 1.01% and 1.13%, respectively. The Fed’s favorite inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose just enough to keep everyone optimistic but not worried.

# Intel's Wild Ride: Split Decisions and Chip Ambitions

Intel ($INTC) is shaking things up once more. The chip giant is cozying up with its financial wizards over at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to brainstorm a way out of its current jam. And by jam, we mean a crater-sized challenge, not a pothole. Rumor has it, Intel might be on the verge of splitting its product design and manufacturing arms or even hitting the brakes on some factory projects to keep afloat.

This news sent Intel's stock on a rollercoaster, surging 9.5% to $22.04—its biggest one-day jump since October 2022. That's a welcome lift after watching its stock nosedive nearly 60% over the past year.

# What's Intel Cooking Up?

CEO Pat Gelsinger is back in the kitchen, cooking up a potential split of Intel's design and manufacturing divisions—a move that could shake up the entire chip industry. Other menu options include mergers, acquisitions, or dialing down some of those ambitious factory plans. These are tough calls, especially in a market plagued by dropping sales and fierce competition.

Gelsinger's master plan has always been bold: turning Intel into a dual-force, designing and manufacturing chips to compete with titans like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. ($TSM). But with a $1.61 billion net loss last quarter, it looks like Intel might need to pump the brakes on its big dreams—at least for now.

# Wait and See

Don’t expect any big announcements just yet. Intel's board won't be making any hasty decisions, with options set to be reviewed in September. So, hold onto those stocks for now—no need for a panic sale just yet.

Still, Intel is feeling the heat. Gelsinger's grand comeback plan hasn't gone off without a hitch, and the foundry business alone reported a hefty **$2.8 billion** operating loss last quarter. Meanwhile, competitors like Nvidia ($NVDA) are having a field day, doubling Intel’s revenue in 2024 and cashing in on the AI boom.

# Looking for the Silver Lining

Despite the storm clouds, Gelsinger remains hopeful, forecasting a return to sales growth by the fourth quarter, thanks to a recovering PC market and some shiny new products. But with skeptical investors and a stock still struggling to bounce back, Intel's path to regaining its glory days looks like a steep climb.

And let’s not forget the guy who bet his grandma’s $700k inheritance on Intel. After a tough year watching his investment plummet, he's finally seeing a glimmer of hope with that 9.5% pop. It’s not quite enough to make up for all those sleepless nights, but hey, it's a start! Fingers crossed his faith in Intel’s comeback doesn’t go unrewarded—grandma’s watching!

# Earnings Roundup: Lululemon, Ulta, and Crowdstrike

# Lululemon’s Bumpy Stretch

Lululemon Athletica ($LULU) had a rough day, managing just a 0.18% gain despite some hurdles. The athletic wear brand beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates by around 8%, but revenue was a different story. The company pulled in $2.37 billion—just shy of the expected $2.41 billion. This marks Lululemon’s first revenue miss in over two years, thanks largely to the lackluster launch of their “Breezethrough” workout pants. Customers weren't feeling the breeze, forcing Lululemon to yank the product from shelves. Adding to the woes, the company also slashed its full-year revenue forecast to between $10.28 billion and $10.38 billion, down from a previous $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion.

# Ulta’s Bad Hair Day

Ulta Beauty ($ULTA) had a less-than-glamorous day, with shares dropping 4.01% after disappointing on both earnings and revenue fronts. Ulta reported earnings of $5.30 per share, falling short of the $5.46 analysts were expecting. Revenue didn’t sparkle either, coming in at $2.55 billion against an anticipated $2.61 billion. The biggest shocker was a 1.2% dip in comparable store sales—a far cry from the 8% increase this time last year. CEO Dave Kimbell pointed the finger at fierce competition in the beauty market. With customers being lured away by rivals, Ulta had no choice but to cut its full-year guidance.

# CrowdStrike’s Comeback Story

On a brighter note, CrowdStrike ($CRWD) had a solid day, with shares climbing 2.06% following strong second-quarter earnings. The cybersecurity firm posted a 32% jump in revenue year-over-year for Q2, surprising everyone after a massive global software glitch caused about $5.4 billion in damages. Despite the earnings win, the July 19th mishap—which led to millions of Microsoft computers crashing due to a bungled update—forced CrowdStrike to lower its full-year profitability outlook. The company is grappling with hefty costs from the fallout, including discounts to keep customers and a slew of lawsuits. Nevertheless, investors cheered CrowdStrike's resilience, impressed by how quickly the company bounced back.

So, whether it’s stretching to meet revenue targets, fixing a bad hair day, or dodging tech disasters, these companies are certainly keeping investors on their toes.

# Next Week

Markets are closed in the US for Labor Day next Monday, giving everyone a long weekend to kick back. But don’t get too comfortable—the shorter work week still brings a handful of key economic reports.

* **Tuesday:** We’ll get the final US manufacturing PMI.
* **Wednesday:** Keep an eye out for job openings and factory orders data.
* **Thursday:** The ADP employment report and weekly initial jobless claims numbers are on deck.
* **Friday:** The big one—Friday’s employment report. This is the same report that tanked markets earlier this month. The labor market is a key factor in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions, and another disappointing reading could mean a smaller rate cut when the Fed meets next month.

# Earnings

As the calendar flips to September, the pace of earnings announcements cools off dramatically. But there are still a few heavy hitters to watch:

* **Wednesday:** Dick’s Sporting Goods ($DKS), Dollar Tree ($DLTR), and Hormel Foods ($HRL) will report.
* **Thursday:** Nio ($NIO), DocuSign ($DOCU), and Bowlero ($BOWL)—yes, the publicly traded bowling company.
* **Friday:** Genesco ($GCO) and Big Lots ($BIG) wrap up the week.

So, even with a holiday-shortened week, there’s plenty to keep us busy. Enjoy the break, but be ready for a Friday that could shake things up!",08-31-2024
"Stock Market Recap 08/29/2024: OpenAI Seeks $100 Billion Valuation + Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom + Dollar General’s Big Miss# Markets

* The stock market wrapped up a mixed bag of a day as Wall Street digested Nvidia’s less-than-stellar earnings report. The Dow strutted to a new record high, up 0.59% or 244 points, while the Nasdaq took a hit, dropping 0.23% thanks to Nvidia's continued slump. The S&P 500 played it safe, ending the day pretty much flat.
* On the bright side, solid economic data offered some optimism. The second-quarter GDP got a boost, jobless claims edged lower, and inflation showed signs of cooling, with the PCE price index slowing to 2.5%. While Nvidia’s rough patch dragged tech stocks down, the rest of the market mostly brushed it off, with five of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing in the green. Looks like Wall Street is still banking on some good vibes despite a few hiccups.

# OpenAI Nears Funding Round at More Than $100 Billion Valuation

OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT, is reportedly gearing up to raise a new round of funding that could value the company at a whopping $100 billion. The tech firm, best known for revolutionizing how we chat with machines, is currently deep in discussions to secure several billion dollars from investors.

**The major players?** Thrive Capital is leading the charge, set to throw in a cool $1 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft ($MSFT) isn't sitting on the sidelines either. The tech giant, which already has a hefty $13 billion stake in OpenAI, is expected to chip in more funds to keep their AI bromance strong.

But that’s not all. Rumor has it Apple and Nvidia might also join the investment frenzy, with Apple looking to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, making your iPhone chats a whole lot smarter. Nvidia, a key supplier for OpenAI’s AI infrastructure, could benefit from increased demand for their chips as OpenAI’s need for computing power grows.

# The AI Arms Race is On

OpenAI’s latest funding effort isn't just about beefing up its balance sheet; it's about keeping its place at the forefront of the AI arms race. The startup is racing against heavyweights like Google, Amazon, and Meta, each pouring billions into developing their own AI tech. Google and Amazon recently backed Anthropic, an OpenAI rival, while Meta is giving away its AI models for free.

With AI predicted to transform the global economy, all the big players are jostling for a piece of the pie. OpenAI’s annualized revenue hit $3.4 billion earlier this year, a figure that's sure to swell as the company rolls out more products and services.

# Cash to Burn

What’s driving this scramble for funds? OpenAI’s ambitions are as high as its valuation. CEO Sam Altman is chasing the lofty goal of creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) – machines that can outperform humans at just about any job. But achieving AGI isn’t cheap. Building their latest model, GPT-4, set them back over $100 million, and the next one will likely cost even more.

**In-house perks:** The new funding round could also benefit OpenAI’s employees, who might get the chance to cash in some of their shares later this year, according to a memo from CFO Sarah Friar. It’s a sweet deal in a speculative market that isn’t yet raking in cash at the same pace as it’s spending.

# Bottom Line

OpenAI is pushing hard to stay on top in the AI world, and it’s getting the cash to do it. With investors lining up to back the startup, all eyes will be on how it uses these billions to outmaneuver the competition and build the next generation of AI tech. And with Apple and Nvidia potentially joining the fray, the battle for AI supremacy just got even more interesting.

# Dell Delivers Strong Earnings on AI Server Boom

Dell Technologies ($DELL) is riding the AI wave, and it’s paying off big time. The tech giant reported a 9% jump in total revenue to $25 billion for the fiscal second quarter, crushing Wall Street’s expectations. The driving force? A surge in demand for AI-optimized servers.

# AI Servers: The Star of the Show

Dell’s AI-optimized server sales skyrocketed to $3.2 billion in the second quarter, up from $2.6 billion in the prior period. The server unit, part of Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group, saw a 38% increase in sales to $11.65 billion, beating estimates by a wide margin. Dell's success is largely tied to the booming demand for AI servers, especially those built around Nvidia’s ($NVDA) chips.

Despite some concerns over margins due to the high costs of AI servers and a competitive pricing environment, Dell's operating margin for its infrastructure unit improved to 11%, up from 8% last quarter. This easing of margin worries suggests Dell’s investments in AI are beginning to pay off.

# PC Sales Still in a Slump

While AI servers are flying off the shelves, Dell's traditional PC business is struggling. Revenue from personal computers dropped 4% to $12.4 billion, with consumer sales plummeting 22% from a year ago. The decline reflects the ongoing challenges in the PC market as the pandemic-driven surge in laptop purchases continues to cool down.

Business PC sales remained flat, a stark contrast to rival HP Inc., which saw an 8% gain in enterprise PC sales during the same period. Dell’s COO, Jeff Clarke, noted that recovery in the PC market is still ""a little further out"" than previously anticipated.

# SecureWorks: On the Chopping Block?

In a move to streamline operations, Dell is reportedly exploring the sale of SecureWorks Corp. ($SCWX), a cybersecurity company it currently owns a majority stake in. This isn’t Dell’s first attempt to offload SecureWorks; a previous sale effort back in 2019 fell through. With a market value of about $772 million, SecureWorks’ future under Dell’s umbrella remains uncertain.

# What’s Next for Dell?

Looking ahead, Dell has projected fiscal third-quarter revenue of around $24.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations. The company also revised its full-year guidance slightly upwards, now expecting between $95.5 billion and $98.5 billion in revenue, up from a previous range of $93.5 billion to $97.5 billion.

Dell’s stock has been on a tear this year, up 48% so far. With AI server demand showing no signs of slowing, the company seems well-positioned to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. However, challenges in the PC market and questions about long-term profitability remain on the horizon. For now, though, it seems like Dell is enjoying its moment in the AI spotlight.

# Dollar General’s Big Miss: What Happened?

Dollar General ($DG) just experienced its worst day ever on Wall Street. The discount retailer's shares nosedived 32% after the company slashed its full-year forecast, citing a tough financial climate for its core customers—those living paycheck to paycheck. This is the biggest drop since the company went public in 2009.

# The Bad News

CEO Todd Vasos reported that the company had to cut its 2024 forecasts for comparable sales and earnings due to customers tightening their belts, particularly on essential goods. Dollar General now expects same-store sales to rise only 1% to 1.6% for the year, down from an earlier estimate of 2% to 2.7%. The company’s profit forecast was also reduced, predicting earnings per share between $5.50 and $6.20, significantly lower than the previous $6.80 to $7.55.

Sales in the second fiscal quarter fell short of expectations, with earnings per share at $1.70 compared to the $1.79 analysts had anticipated. Revenue was also below forecasts, coming in at $10.21 billion against the predicted $10.37 billion. Despite a slight uptick in traffic, shoppers are spending less per visit, hitting Dollar General where it hurts—right in the sales figures.

# Blame Game

Vasos blamed the poor performance on weakening consumer sentiment among lower-income shoppers, who are finding it harder to make ends meet due to economic pressures like high interest rates. However, other discount retailers like Walmart are reporting strong sales, indicating that the problem might not just be with consumers but also with Dollar General’s execution.

Dollar General is now focusing on “controlling what we can control,” as Vasos put it. This includes efforts to improve store operations and inventory management, but it seems the company still has a long road ahead to turn things around.

# The Ripple Effect

Dollar Tree ($DLTR) wasn’t immune to Dollar General’s woes, with shares sliding 10.24% in sympathy. Big Lots ($BIG) also took a hit, plummeting 38.35%. Meanwhile, Best Buy ($BBY) saw a surge of 14.11%, buoyed by its stronger-than-expected earnings report and a more optimistic consumer outlook.

# What’s Next For The General?

Dollar General’s game plan involves cutting back on new store openings, slashing inventory, and focusing more on essential goods. However, with customers running out of funds towards the end of each month and competition from big players like Walmart, the retailer will need more than just tweaks to its operations to get back on track.

Despite the grim outlook, some analysts are still holding out hope. With an average price target of $144, there’s a belief that the stock could rebound—if Dollar General can address its operational shortcomings and the economic pressure on its customers eases. But for now, it’s a tough time to be a bargain hunter—or a shareholder—in Dollar General.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season is winding down, so don’t expect any blockbuster announcements tomorrow. But before you check out for the long weekend, there’s one final, crucial piece of economic news on the horizon.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE)—the Fed’s go-to inflation gauge—is set to drop. For those who aren’t economists in their spare time, PCE measures how much prices are rising or falling across the U.S. economy. The “core” PCE strips out food and energy prices (you know, the stuff that makes your wallet cry at the pump or grocery store) to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation.

And here’s the thing: Everyone is banking on the Fed to start cutting interest rates at its September meeting, no matter what tomorrow’s PCE report shows. But this is the last major inflation reading before the Fed gathers to make its big decision, so the numbers could sway just how aggressive they go with those rate cuts. In other words, tomorrow’s PCE could be the final puzzle piece in the Fed’s inflation-fighting game.",08-29-2024

* [**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - Earnings yesterday, beat expectations but weren’t the blowout everyone expected. Executives said on the earnings call that NVDA still expects to begin earning revenue from Blackwell in this fiscal year. EPS of 0.68 vs 0.64 exp. $50B share buyback. Revenue grew close to 122% YoY. Overall, I don’t really see a reason to change one’s position if long/short. (I’m not changing mine, which is currently long.) Consensus EPS is $.64, but of course, future outlook will decide the move. This will pretty much decide the direction of the market for the next few days because we traded close to flat for the past week.

# Buffett's Berkshire Joins the Trillion-Dollar Club 

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just hit a whopping $1 trillion market cap, becoming the first non-tech U.S. company to join the exclusive trillion-dollar club. Take that, Silicon Valley!

Berkshire's stock has been on a roll this year, climbing 30% in 2024 and outpacing the S&P 500's 17% gain. The company's strong performance has been fueled by robust insurance results, economic optimism, and the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts on the horizon.

# Old-School Cool with a Modern Twist 

Unlike its techy trillion-dollar club companions—think Apple ($AAPL), Microsoft, and Nvidia—Berkshire's success is built on what some might call ""old-school"" businesses. We're talking railways, insurance, and Dairy Queen blizzards, not cloud computing or AI chips.

Buffett, who took over a floundering textile company in the 1960s and transformed it into this sprawling conglomerate, has proven that slow and steady does indeed win the race. Even with a significant chunk of Berkshire's portfolio invested in Apple, the firm's focus on value over flashy growth has paid off big time.

# Cash Moves and Strategic Shifts 

Recently, Buffett has been in what some might call ""defensive mode."" He's been trimming Berkshire's holdings in some heavyweights like Apple and Bank of America, building up a record cash pile of about $277 billion. This cautious approach has some investors speculating whether the Oracle of Omaha is seeing storm clouds on the economic horizon.

Buffett might be getting ready for more acquisition opportunities or simply reinforcing Berkshire's reputation as a safe haven amidst market uncertainty. Whatever the case, his strategy appears to be working—investors are rewarding Berkshire's steady hand with a spot in the trillion-dollar club.

# What’s Next? 

Looking ahead, Berkshire's all-weather portfolio seems well-positioned for whatever the future holds. The company might not boast eye-popping growth, but it's hard to argue with a steady performer in a world of market volatility.

As Greg Abel prepares to step into Buffett's legendary shoes, only time will tell if Berkshire can continue its winning streak. But for now, the Oracle of Omaha's empire is basking in the glow of a trillion-dollar valuation—a testament to the power of patience, prudence, and, of course, a good old-fashioned blizzard from Dairy Queen.

# Nvidia: Not Quite Perfect

# By the Numbers:

* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $0.68 adjusted vs. $0.64 expected
* **Revenue:** $30 billion vs. $28.9 billion expected
* **Q3 Revenue Forecast:** $32.5 billion vs. $31.9 billion expected (but fell short of high estimates up to $37.9 billion)
* **Stock Movement:** Down -5.87% in extended trading

Nvidia ($NVDA) just dropped their latest earnings report, and while it wasn't a total disaster, it also didn't have us popping champagne. The chipmaker forecasted third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, which is technically higher than the average analyst estimate of $31.9 billion. But here's the catch: some pie-in-the-sky expectations were up to $37.9 billion. As a result, Nvidia's stock took a 5% dip in late trading, adding a reality check to its gravity-defying run this year.

* **Chip Slip:** The culprit behind this lukewarm reception? Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. The company admitted to hitting some production snags, which means they’re tinkering with manufacturing processes to boost yields (think: more functioning chips per batch). While CEO Jensen Huang reassured everyone that the ""anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,"" the market isn't big on anticipation—it’s all about execution.
* **Data Center Dominance:** Nvidia has been riding the AI boom like a pro surfer catching a killer wave. With nearly 88% of its revenue coming from data center chips, Nvidia is the go-to for AI accelerators. Last quarter, they pulled in $26.3 billion from their data-center division alone, handily beating the $25.1 billion estimate. Their gaming segment isn’t too shabby either, with $2.9 billion in sales. But let’s face it, all eyes are on their AI chips powering the likes of ChatGPT.
* **Competition Heating Up:** Nvidia’s success hasn't gone unnoticed. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are scrambling to grab a slice of the AI pie, even if their combined revenues only account for about 5% of Nvidia’s total. Meanwhile, Nvidia continues to expand its lead, having shipped samples of its Blackwell chips despite the production hiccups.
* **AI Boom or Bust? :** With a market cap north of $3 trillion, Nvidia has been the belle of the AI ball. Yet, the soaring spending on AI infrastructure has some wondering if we're heading towards a bubble. Nvidia remains optimistic, projecting that the demand for its AI chips will continue to skyrocket. Investors, on the other hand, might be looking for more than just optimism after the stock’s recent rollercoaster ride.

For now, it looks like Nvidia is still in the driver's seat of the AI revolution. But with production challenges and rising competition, they'll need to keep their foot on the gas.

# Nvidia Earnings — The Moment of Truth

Get your popcorn ready, folks. Nvidia ($NVDA) is about to take center stage with its latest earnings report, and Wall Street is buzzing like it's the season finale of your favorite show.

# What’s on the Menu?

Nvidia's chips are the golden ticket for training AI systems, so expectations are high—really high. Analysts are predicting the company will report a whopping $28.84 billion in revenue for its fiscal second quarter, more than doubling last year’s number. For those keeping score at home, Nvidia’s stock has already skyrocketed 159% this year, and the stakes are only getting higher.

The real question isn’t about what Nvidia will say about last quarter—it’s about what they’ll promise for the next one. Investors want to see revenue guidance between $33 and $34 billion, and they’re especially interested in any gossip about the new Blackwell chips. 

# Bumps in the Road?

But it hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Nvidia. Concerns about delays in rolling out those next-gen Blackwell chips have investors a little jittery. Earlier reports of manufacturing hiccups set off alarm bells, but some analysts, like Morgan Stanley’s team, think this might be much ado about nothing. They’re banking on strong demand to keep the hype train on track, even if Nvidia’s new toys aren’t ready to ship until next year.

# The Bigger Picture

Nvidia's rise has been meteoric, but it's also faced some turbulence. The stock tumbled over 25% during July and August as tech stocks took a hit from broader market rotations. Concerns about overspending on AI and potential delays with the Blackwell chips only added fuel to the fire.

Yet, Nvidia has a knack for bouncing back. The stock recovered from those earlier stumbles, and with its earnings report just around the corner, the market is bracing for a potential 10% swing in either direction.

Will Nvidia deliver another mic-drop moment? Or will it leave investors wanting more? We shall find out very soon…

# Zuckerberg vs. The White House

Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta ($META), just dropped a bombshell, claiming that the Biden administration pressured Meta to censor Covid-19 content on Facebook and Instagram. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, Zuckerberg alleged that senior officials from the White House repeatedly pushed Meta to remove certain Covid-19 posts, including humor and satire, and expressed frustration when the platform didn’t comply.

# Meta’s Regrets and the White House's Response

Zuckerberg said that while it was ultimately Meta’s decision to take down content, he believes the government’s pressure was inappropriate. He expressed regret over not being more outspoken about it at the time and acknowledged that Meta made some decisions during the pandemic that, with the benefit of hindsight, it might not make again. “We should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration,” Zuckerberg said, vowing to push back if faced with similar demands in the future.

The White House responded to Zuckerberg’s claims by defending its actions, stating that during the pandemic, the administration encouraged responsible measures to protect public health and safety but didn't directly enforce censorship. “Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies should make independent choices about the information they present,” a spokesperson said.

# The Ongoing Debate Over Free Speech and Content Moderation

This latest revelation underscores the ongoing debate about the role social media companies should play in moderating content. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan, has accused big tech firms of colluding with the government to censor speech. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg is taking a more neutral stance moving forward, noting that he doesn’t plan to make political contributions in the upcoming U.S. presidential election to avoid appearing biased.

The saga continues as Meta and the government navigate the tricky waters of content moderation, free speech, and the responsibilities of tech giants. It’s a reminder that in the digital age, the lines between public health, free expression, and political pressure are as blurred as ever.

  


# Super Micro Gets Hit With Hindenburg Report

Super Micro Computer Inc. ($SMCI) is facing some serious heat after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company and dropped a bombshell report accusing the AI server maker of some sketchy financial practices. According to Hindenburg, their deep dive uncovered ""glaring accounting red flags,"" undisclosed related party transactions, and failures around export controls. Naturally, the market freaked out—shares of Super Micro plummeted as much as 8.7% before clawing back some losses to close down 2.6%. Not exactly the kind of day you want to have.

But if you were hoping for a response from Super Micro, don’t hold your breath. The company has chosen to stay mum on the whole ordeal, calling it all “rumors and speculation.” Hindenburg, meanwhile, is no stranger to shaking things up. They’ve taken down big names before, like Carl Icahn’s empire and India’s Adani Group. So, when they set their sights on Super Micro, investors understandably got the jitters.

# Riding the AI Wave…for Now

Super Micro has been surfing the AI wave like a pro, becoming a major player in the server market with its high-powered gear and cozy relationship with Nvidia ($NVDA). Business has been booming—revenue more than doubled to $14.9 billion in the last fiscal year thanks to a surge in demand for AI servers. But Hindenburg’s report casts a shadow over that success, hinting that beneath the surface, there might be some not-so-savory practices that could trip up Super Micro as competition heats up.

And it’s not just Hindenburg throwing shade. Analysts have been whispering about the company’s hefty spending to support the next gen of AI chips and its slimmer profit margins on those high-cost servers. There’s also growing concern that the big tech companies might start tightening their belts on AI spending if they don’t see the dollars rolling in soon. For now, Super Micro’s got some serious explaining to do if it wants to keep riding high in the AI game.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Forget the rest—there's only one name on everyone's lips this earnings season: Nvidia. The AI chip giant has the entire market holding its breath. Why the hype?

# Temu’s Parent Company PDD Takes a Dive

PDD Holdings ($PDD), the proud parent of budget shopping sensation Temu, just took a nasty tumble down the stock market stairs. After posting lackluster quarterly sales and giving a gloomy forecast, shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant plummeted 28.5% on Monday, marking the steepest single-day drop in the company's history. Ouch.

# Not-So-Sunny Outlook

What’s behind this dramatic fall from grace? It turns out, PDD’s latest revenue figures didn’t quite hit the mark. The company reported revenue of $13.36 billion for Q2, falling short of Wall Street's forecast of $14.03 billion. That's a miss that investors didn't take lightly. Jun Liu, PDD’s VP of finance, didn’t sugarcoat the situation, warning of “intensified competition and external challenges” that could continue to put pressure on growth and profitability. In other words, it’s going to be a bumpy road ahead.

Even with a massive marketing push and heavy investments in expansion, the slowdown is evident. The company noted that Chinese consumers are shifting their spending from goods to experiences—think less shopping, more eating out and entertainment. This shift, coupled with an ailing Chinese economy, has left PDD scrambling to adjust its strategy. And if that wasn’t enough, rivals like Alibaba ($BABA) and JD. com ($JD) are also feeling the heat, posting weaker-than-expected results in the face of changing consumer behaviors and economic conditions.

# All About That Budget Life

Despite the challenges at home, PDD has been casting a wider net, particularly in Europe and beyond, trying to capture the global audience’s attention with Temu's low-cost charm. And it’s not just the usual suspects like Alibaba that PDD has to worry about—everyone from TikTok’s parent company ByteDance to Amazon is vying for the budget-conscious shopper’s dollar.

PDD’s plan? Double down on investment, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits. Chairman and Co-CEO Chen Lei made it clear that they’re willing to accept “short-term sacrifices” to build a stronger foundation for the future. In the meantime, PDD is focusing on cleaning up its platform by supporting high-quality merchants and cracking down on the lower-quality ones.

# What’s Next?

With competition heating up and consumer spending on the decline, PDD is gearing up for a fight to maintain its spot in the e-commerce world. While the company has made significant strides in gaining ground against giants like Alibaba and JD. com, it's clear that they’re in for a tough battle both at home and abroad. The days ahead will tell whether PDD’s aggressive growth strategy will pay off or if it’ll face more turbulence in the marketplace.

# Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Detained in France

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov just found himself in hot water in France—and not the ice-cold baths he’s famously fond of. The 39-year-old billionaire was detained at an airport outside Paris, suspected of allowing illegal activity to run rampant on Telegram, the messaging app he founded. If you’re picturing Durov scrolling through a flurry of encrypted messages, sipping his French espresso, think again.

French authorities aren’t thrilled with Telegram’s hands-off approach to content moderation, and they’ve made it known. Durov’s arrest, which could be extended by 24 hours, is part of a broader investigation into online criminality. Allegations range from the distribution of child exploitation material to fraud and cyberbullying. Durov’s failure to cooperate with law enforcement on these matters didn’t help his case either.

# Russian Roulette

The plot thickens with some political spice—Durov’s arrest has sparked a wave of reactions. The Russian Embassy in Paris quickly demanded explanations from French authorities, while Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to rally support for Durov with a “#FreePavel” hashtag, suggesting this is an assault on free speech.

President Emmanuel Macron, however, insists there’s no political motivation here. He assured that Durov’s arrest was purely a legal matter, not a diplomatic chess move. Macron’s statement comes as French authorities crack down on platforms like Telegram, which they believe facilitate illegal activities due to lax content oversight.

# Telegram’s Wild Ride

Founded in 2013, Telegram quickly became a hit, especially in countries with strict censorship. It’s been a crucial communication tool for both Ukrainian officials and the Russian government during the ongoing war, making it a favorite for those who value privacy—and for some, a tool for illicit activity.

With over 900 million users, Telegram has also been a thorn in the side of governments worldwide, thanks to its encrypted messaging and limited moderation. Durov, who lives in Dubai and holds citizenship in France and the UAE, might be the latest high-profile tech CEO to face the consequences of this tension between free speech and regulation.

# What’s Next?

As Durov waits to see if his detention will be extended, the tech world is watching closely. Will he face charges, or is this just a scare tactic? For now, Telegram’s CEO remains in a legal limbo, caught between his app’s free-wheeling ethos and the tightening grip of government oversight.

  


# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Hey, shoppers! It’s time to check your economic vitals because tomorrow, the Conference Board is dropping its latest consumer confidence report. Think of it as a sneak peek into the collective mood of American wallets—are we feeling spendy or saving those pennies?

Here’s the scoop: Consumer spending powers about 70% of the US economy, so all eyes are on this report to see just how sturdy that spending spree is. Analysts are predicting a slight boost in confidence, with August’s index expected to climb to 101.8 from July’s 100.3. For context, any number over 90 usually signals a robust economy. 

Another thing to watch? Home-buying intentions. With mortgage rates cooling off a bit, will more people be house hunting? Last month, intentions hit a 12-year low, so any uptick could be a big deal.

"Stock Market Recap 08/23/2024: Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come + SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn Mission Will Attempt The First Private Spacewalk Next Week# Markets

* Investors celebrated on Friday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at upcoming interest rate cuts, signaling a potential end to the central bank’s aggressive stance on inflation. Powell's comments, made during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, lifted stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite gaining 1.5%, the S&P 500 rising 1.1%, and the Dow Jones climbing 1.1% to its second-highest close ever. 
* Speaking at Jackson Hole, Powell didn’t spill the exact timing or size of the cuts, but his comment that “the time has come” to ease up on rates sent a clear message: the inflation fight is wrapping up, and the economy is looking solid. Investors loved it, and stocks rallied across the board while bond yields took a dive. Looks like the market’s got something to smile about heading into the weekend!

# Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come…

Drumroll, please! Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just dropped the mic at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, announcing the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates. Yup, the big pivot is here. After two years of cranking up rates to tame inflation, Powell is officially ready to start loosening the purse strings.

# Breaking Down the Big Shift

In what has to be the least surprising surprise of the year, Powell confirmed that rate cuts are coming soon, saying, “The time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Translation? The Fed is done playing the inflation-fighting game and is now turning its attention to preventing a meltdown in the job market.

And Wall Street heard him loud and clear. Stocks jumped, with the Dow climbing over 400 points and the Nasdaq up by about 1.5%. Investors are stoked, Treasury yields are dipping, and everyone’s feeling a little lighter—except maybe those holding cash.

# So, What’s the Game Plan?

With inflation cooling off and the job market starting to look like a sad trombone, Powell’s got his eye on rate cuts. The big question now is: How much and how fast? The next Fed meeting in mid-September is shaping up to be a real cliffhanger. Will they go for a cautious quarter-point cut, or do they swing for the fences with a half-point slash?

As always, it’s all about the data. Powell didn’t spill all the beans, but he made it clear the Fed will be watching the numbers closely. A few more weak jobs reports, and we could see some serious rate-cutting action.

# What Does It Mean for You?

Well, if you’ve been sweating those sky-high interest rates on your mortgage, auto loan, or credit card, there might be some relief on the horizon. But don’t pop the champagne just yet—Powell’s not exactly rushing to the finish line here. Rate cuts will likely be gradual, and the Fed’s going to take it slow and steady to avoid rocking the boat too much.

So, keep an eye on those economic reports, stay tuned for the next Fed move, and maybe start planning what you’ll do with those extra dollars in your pocket. A new plant for the office? That fancy coffee machine? The possibilities are endless, but the rate cuts? Not so much. Let’s see how this one plays out!

# Polaris Dawn Mission Faces Brief Delay Before Historic Spacewalk

The Polaris Dawn mission, which is set to make history as the first space mission featuring a spacewalk conducted entirely by non-government astronauts, has been delayed by 24 hours. Originally slated for launch early Monday, the mission is now scheduled for liftoff on Tuesday at the earliest, according to SpaceX. This minor setback is all part of ensuring everything is perfect before this groundbreaking flight.

# What's the Plan?

Once it gets the green light, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will carry the all-civilian Polaris Dawn crew aboard the Dragon spacecraft to an altitude of 870 miles above Earth. This marks the highest any human has flown since the Apollo missions of the 1970s. The team will then descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth, where they will spend five days conducting scientific experiments and testing new technologies, including a laser-based satellite communication system using SpaceX’s Starlink.

But the highlight of the mission will undoubtedly be the spacewalk, set to be the first-ever performed by private citizens. This ambitious feat will require the entire Dragon spacecraft to be depressurized, a risky maneuver given that the craft lacks an airlock. As a result, all four crew members, led by billionaire entrepreneur and mission commander Jared Isaacman, will don SpaceX’s new EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) suits and be tethered for safety as they venture into the vacuum of space.

# A Mission for the Books

This mission isn’t just about making history for the sake of it. The Polaris Dawn crew, which includes Isaacman, retired Air Force lieutenant colonel Scott “Kidd” Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, aims to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight and gather valuable data for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The team will navigate through the Van Allen radiation belts—regions of intense radiation that pose significant challenges for deep space exploration—while testing the limits of their new spacesuits.

Despite the slight delay, anticipation remains high for what could be one of the most significant milestones in the burgeoning era of commercial space exploration. As Isaacman and his crew prepare to take civilian space travel to new heights, the world will be watching closely, eager to see this next chapter in human spaceflight unfold.



# On The Horizon

# Next Week

Next week’s economic calendar might kick off with some lightweights, but the real action comes on Friday. Monday brings us durable goods orders, Tuesday features the consumer confidence index, and Thursday rounds out the preliminaries with the advance goods trade balance.

Then, it's showtime: Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report takes the stage. This is the last PCE reading before the Fed’s September meeting, where they’re expected to cut rates. How much they cut—25 or 50 basis points—could hinge on what this report has to say.

Earnings are slowing down, but there’s still some excitement in store. Wednesday is the main event, headlined by none other than Nvidia ($NVDA).

# Powell at the Podium — What to Expect from the Fed Chair’s Jackson Hole Speech

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is stepping up to the mic at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET. And while the setting might be picturesque, don’t get your hopes up for any earth-shattering news. Here’s what you can expect from Powell’s highly anticipated speech—and why it might be more of a snoozer than a showstopper.

# Rate Cuts Are Coming... Just Not Yet

Let’s get one thing straight: Wall Street’s already convinced that rate cuts are on the horizon. The smart money says the Fed’s going to start trimming rates in September and keep snipping away well into 2025. The real mystery is whether Powell will go for a cautious quarter-point cut or something bolder, like half a point. Most bets are on the former—unless the economy suddenly hits a rough patch in the next few weeks.

So, what’s Powell’s role in all this? He’s there to confirm the market’s expectations without spooking anyone. The theme of this year’s conference, “Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,” is pretty much code for, “We’re playing it safe and sticking to the data.” Translation: Powell’s speech will likely be more of a recap than a revelation.

# Same Script, Different Year

This isn’t Powell’s first rodeo at Jackson Hole. Back in 2020, he used this same stage to roll out a new strategy that let inflation run hotter than usual, all in the name of promoting a more inclusive job market. Flash forward to now, and Powell’s likely to acknowledge the Fed’s progress in cooling down inflation while keeping an eye on a labor market that’s starting to show some cracks.

But if you’re expecting any major policy shifts, don’t hold your breath. Powell’s message will probably be something like, “We’ve made progress, but we’re not out of the woods yet.” In other words, he’ll hint that rate cuts are coming but won’t commit to specifics. After all, the Fed’s been preaching “data dependency” for months now, and that tune isn’t changing anytime soon.

So, while the backdrop at Jackson Hole will be as dramatic as ever, Powell’s speech? Not so much. Expect cautious optimism, a lot of “we’re watching the numbers,” and a gentle pat on the back for a job (mostly) well done. The markets might not get the fireworks they were hoping for, but hey, steady and predictable isn’t the worst thing in the world.



# Market Movements

* Cava Group ($CAVA) raised its full-year outlook after posting second-quarter results that beat expectations, signaling strong consumer demand for fast-casual dining.
* Starboard Value urged Autodesk Inc. ($ADSK)’s board to evaluate whether Chief Executive Officer Andrew Anagnost is the right person to lead the company following recent accounting issues.

# Peloton’s Power Move: Biggest Rally Ever as Turnaround Takes Shape

Peloton ($PTON) just hit a major milestone—its biggest stock rally ever. After reporting earnings that blew past Wall Street’s expectations, shares of the at-home fitness giant surged 35%, closing at $4.55. Not too shabby for a company that’s been riding an emotional rollercoaster since the pandemic boom.

# Beating the Odds (and Estimates)

Peloton posted revenue of $644 million for the quarter ending June 30, a modest but meaningful uptick from last year and well above the $630 million analysts were bracing for. The company’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $70.3 million, flipping the script on last year’s $34.7 million loss and easily surpassing the $53.2 million analysts had forecasted.

So what’s behind the glow-up? Cost-cutting, baby. Peloton’s been trimming the fat—slashing expenses, cutting its workforce by 15%, and eking out $15 million in cost savings last quarter alone. The company is finally seeing green, not red, with a free cash flow of $26 million.

# The Ride Ahead: Smooth or Bumpy?

But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Peloton’s forecast for the current quarter is a bit of a reality check. The company is predicting revenue between $560 million and $580 million—down about 4% from last year and lower than analysts’ expectations of $602 million. The subscriber base is also expected to shrink, with a 3% drop in users still sweating it out on Peloton hardware and a steeper 26% decline in paid app users.

And then there’s the search for a new CEO. With Barry McCarthy stepping down in May, Peloton’s leadership has been in a bit of limbo. Interim co-CEOs Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo are holding down the fort while the hunt for a new leader is “top of mind for all stakeholders,” according to the company.

Despite the ups and downs, Peloton’s made it clear they’re in this for the long haul. The company acknowledges the road to recovery is still winding, especially with an unpredictable economy and the lingering question of whether people will stick with home workouts now that gyms are back in full swing.

So, while Peloton’s stock might be on a high right now, the real test will be whether they can keep the momentum going—or if this rally is just a quick burst of adrenaline.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week’s headline event isn’t about the usual economic reports—Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole is stealing the spotlight.

Powell has been pretty guarded about his plans for monetary policy, so it’s unlikely he’ll drop any big hints about rate cuts before the Fed’s next meeting. But with the recent revision of 818K Jobs in nonfarm payroll data, investors are hungry for insights on the job market—something Powell might need to address if he wants to avoid triggering a market slide.

# Carl Icahn’s $2M 'Oops' Moment: SEC Slaps His Wrist

# Icahn’s Costly Oversight

Carl Icahn, the billionaire investor known for his high-stakes moves, just found himself on the wrong side of the SEC. The agency slapped him and his investment firm, Icahn Enterprises ($IEP), with a $2 million fine. The reason? Icahn failed to disclose billions in personal margin loans backed by his stake in the company. Icahn himself will pay $500,000, while Icahn Enterprises is on the hook for $1.5 million.

This all started when Hindenburg Research, a notorious short-seller, dropped a bombshell report in 2023. The report claimed that IEP was grossly overvalued and hinted at some shady financial practices. IEP shares plummeted, catching the SEC’s attention. What they found was that Icahn had pledged up to 65% of his IEP units as collateral for personal loans totaling up to $5.1 billion. These pledges, made between 2018 and 2022, went largely unnoticed by investors because Icahn didn’t bother to update his securities filings—until July 2023, well after Hindenburg’s report had already done its damage.

Icahn is now in full damage control, stating he’s “glad to put this matter behind us” and insists that the SEC settlement doesn’t imply that he or IEP engaged in any shady dealings like inflating asset values or running a “Ponzi-like” structure. However, Hindenburg isn’t backing down. On social media, they doubled down on their claims, accusing IEP of still operating in a questionable manner and reiterating their short position on the stock.

# The Fallout Continues

While Icahn may want to move on, the fallout isn’t over yet. IEP’s stock took a 6% hit on the news of the SEC settlement (but ended the day in the green up 1.25%), adding to the ongoing pressure from both regulators and short-sellers. This episode serves as a stark reminder that even Wall Street legends like Icahn aren’t immune to the repercussions of overlooking/dismissing the fine print altogether. Investors, take note: transparency isn’t just a good practice—it’s the law. And when you miss the mark, it can cost you, even if your name is Carl Icahn.

# Palo Alto Networks Surges on Strong Forecast and Buyback Boost

# Sales Surge Despite Spending Fatigue

Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) just gave Wall Street a pleasant surprise. The cybersecurity giant posted a profit forecast for the current quarter that beat expectations, with earnings projected between $1.47 and $1.49 per share—comfortably ahead of analysts’ predictions of $1.43. This upbeat outlook, combined with a 12% sales growth last quarter, sent shares soaring up to 5% in post-market trading and ended the day up 2.77%. The company’s market cap now stands at a robust $111 billion, up from $91 billion at the start of the year.

This marks a significant rebound for Palo Alto after a rough patch earlier this year when CEO Nikesh Arora warned of ""spending fatigue"" among customers. That warning, coupled with a miss on annual sales expectations, had sent the stock plunging by 27%. But it looks like the company has turned a corner, with its recent performance suggesting that cybersecurity is back on the priority list for many companies, especially after a major outage linked to rival CrowdStrike ($CRWD).

# $1 Billion Buyback Bonanza

In addition to the rosy profit forecast, Palo Alto’s board greenlit an extra $500 million for its share repurchase program, doubling the total buyback authorization to a whopping $1 billion. This move is a clear signal of confidence from the company’s leadership, showing that they believe in the stock’s future growth potential.

CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized the importance of cybersecurity in a post-CrowdStrike outage world, noting that Palo Alto’s approach to updates is ""fundamentally different"" and more secure. With customers now more cautious, Palo Alto seems well-positioned to capitalize on any shifts in the market.

# Shifting Metrics and a New Strategy

One notable change: Palo Alto’s CFO Dipak Golechha announced the company will no longer issue guidance on billings forecasts, which had been a contentious point with investors. Instead, the focus will shift to annualized recurring revenue and remaining performance obligations (RPO). While some on Wall Street, like Guggenheim Securities, have raised concerns about relying too heavily on RPO due to its lack of time frame clarity, Palo Alto is confident this shift will provide a clearer picture of its long-term growth prospects.

Overall, Palo Alto Networks appears to be back on track, with a strong forecast, a hefty buyback, and a strategy shift that could keep investors intrigued as the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve.

# Before Market Open: 

* **Lowe’s ($LOW)**: Like its competitor Home Depot, Lowe’s straddles the line between consumer spending and the housing market—both of which are feeling the strain. Home Depot’s recent earnings report highlighted a dip in home renovation spending, dragging Lowe’s shares down with it. While Lowe’s management held steady on its full-year outlook last quarter, any shift in that stance could spark a selloff. Expectations are set at $4.00 EPS and $23.96 billion in revenue.
* **Medtronic ($MDT)**: Medtronic’s shares have been relatively flat this year, but investors are optimistic about the medical device giant’s prospects. The company exceeded analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings last quarter, and a promising pipeline could help it stay competitive in a tough market. Plus, with 47 consecutive years of dividend increases, Medtronic gives shareholders a solid reason to stick around during slower growth periods. The consensus is $1.24 EPS and $8 billion in revenue.

# Breaking Up Google? DOJ Considers a Historic Move

Google ($GOOGL) has long reigned supreme with its trifecta of Search, Android, and YouTube, but its days of unchecked dominance might be numbered. After a federal court ruled that Google’s been playing monopoly with the internet search market, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering some drastic measures that could permanently alter Google’s empire—and send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# Google’s Breakup Drama

For the first time in over 20 years, the DOJ is mulling over the breakup of a major tech company, and Google’s in the crosshairs. This isn’t just a slap on the wrist; the DOJ is reportedly considering forcing Google to shed some of its most profitable assets. Imagine Google Ads—responsible for a staggering $238 billion in 2023—being spun off into a separate entity. That’s just one option on the table. Another scenario could see Google being forced to sell off its Android operating system or Chrome browser, two products that are practically synonymous with the internet itself. The potential breakup could not only reshape Google but could also set a new precedent for regulating other tech giants.

# Flashback to Microsoft’s 2000 Antitrust Battle

If this all sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve seen something like this before. Back in 2000, the DOJ went after Microsoft for its near-total control over the PC market. While the attempt to break up Microsoft was eventually overturned on appeal, the case did lead to restrictions that slowed down the tech giant’s dominance just enough to allow new players—like Google—to rise. Now, Google might find itself in a similar position. The DOJ could impose rules that force Google to share its valuable data and technology with competitors or ban it from entering exclusive contracts that keep rivals at bay. Case in point: Google’s $26 billion splurge to secure default search engine status on iPhones and Firefox. These kinds of practices could soon be a thing of the past.

# Silicon Valley on High Alert

While Google is currently the star of this antitrust drama, every other tech behemoth—from Amazon to Apple to Meta—is watching with bated breath. The outcome of Google’s case could have far-reaching consequences, especially as these companies face their own antitrust challenges. A decision to break up Google could embolden regulators to take a tougher stance across the board, fundamentally altering the landscape of the tech industry. The DOJ is set to reveal its proposed remedies in September, and until then, all of Silicon Valley is on edge, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.

# Walmart Q2 Surge: Higher Sales, Raised Outlook

# By the Numbers:

* **Revenue:** $169.34 billion (vs. $168.46 billion expected)
* **Adjusted EPS:** $0.67 (vs. $0.65 expected)
* **US Same-Store Sales Growth:** 4.2%
* **E-Commerce Growth:** 22% in the U.S.
* **Full-Year Sales Guidance:** 3.75% to 4.75%

# Walmart’s Winning Streak

Walmart ($WMT) just dropped some numbers, and it looks like they're riding high on the wave of deal-seeking shoppers. The retail giant raised its full-year sales outlook, now predicting a rise of up to 4.75%, a bump from its previous cap of 4%. Thanks to a growing number of customers—especially those from higher-income brackets—scouring for bargains, Walmart's stock surged today, marking its biggest intraday gain since late 2022.

The real juice? E-commerce sales in the U.S. shot up by 22%, largely driven by pickups and Walmart’s third-party marketplace. This growth wasn’t just in the grocery aisles either; after 11 quarters of decline, general merchandise sales finally showed some life. Seasonal items like pool noodles were particularly popular—so much so that you could stretch all the noodles sold across 30,000 football fields. That’s a lot of backyard fun.

# Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

Walmart’s success contrasts sharply with other retailers like Home Depot ($HD) and Whirlpool ($WHR), which have been struggling as consumers put off big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to rake in customers across all income levels, including a significant chunk from wealthier households hunting for deals.

With the back-to-school season off to a strong start and inflationary pressures easing a bit, Walmart’s cautious optimism about the rest of the year seems well-placed. The retailer is focusing on keeping prices down, pushing suppliers to do the same, and expanding its high-margin businesses like advertising and membership programs. And with more shoppers tightening their belts and opting for at-home dining over takeout, Walmart’s grocery dominance is likely to continue driving growth.

# Tesla Cybertruck Now Starts at $100K After Dropping Cheapest Model

Tesla ($TSLA) just gave the Cybertruck's price tag a serious jolt—if you were holding out for the ""affordable"" $60,990 model, you're out of luck. Tesla quietly pulled that version from its lineup, leaving the cheapest Cybertruck at a jaw-dropping $99,990. That’s a $39,000 leap from where the price floor used to be.

# The Price of Progress?

But wait, there’s more. The tri-motor Cyberbeast, the souped-up version that puts your foot to the floor with more torque and speed, now costs $119,990. That’s a $20K hike from just a week ago. Remember when Elon Musk promised a $39,990 Cybertruck back in 2019? Ah, simpler times. With the base model gone, it looks like Tesla is banking on buyers with deeper pockets and a taste for luxury—because clearly, the entry-level market isn’t a priority anymore.

# Fast Deliveries or Slowing Demand?

Tesla claims it’s speeding up delivery times, with AWD models potentially arriving as early as this month. But don’t let the expedited shipping fool you—these price hikes might just be a sign that demand is cooling off faster than Musk anticipated. After all, how many folks are really ready to shell out six figures for a truck that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi flick?

Meanwhile, Cybertruck's bumpy road continues with recalls, sinking profits in Tesla's latest quarter, and a flurry of federal investigations. The dream of an affordable, mass-market EV truck seems further away than ever. Plus, faster deliveries could signal that Tesla's inventory is growing—a red flag that maybe, just maybe, those million pre-orders aren’t translating into actual sales. So, while Tesla might be speeding up production, it could also be facing the reality that a $100K truck isn’t exactly a hot commodity. But hey, if you’ve got $100K burning a hole in your pocket, Tesla’s got just the truck for you.

# Trump Returns to X, $DJT Stock Takes a Hit

Donald Trump is back on X (formerly Twitter), and his reappearance is already shaking things up. Just ahead of a highly anticipated interview with Elon Musk, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) dipped 5%. The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, marks Trump’s first major return to the platform since August 2023. The question on everyone’s mind: What does this mean for Trump’s own social media platform, Truth Social?

# X Marks the Spot

Trump’s return to X is a big deal—after all, this is the platform that played a huge role in his political rise. But there’s a twist. Trump previously vowed to stick to his own platform, Truth Social, after being banned from major social media sites. His comeback to X might signal a shift in strategy, especially with the 2024 election looming. And let’s not forget, this move comes after Musk’s recent endorsement of Trump, despite their very public beef just a couple of years ago.

# Stocks Stumble as the Spotlight Shifts

Trump’s return to X isn’t just about tweets—it’s affecting his wallet, too. Shares of Trump Media took a hit, dropping 5% on Monday. Investors seem to be questioning whether Trump’s renewed presence on X could spell trouble for Truth Social. After all, why would Trump’s followers stick around on his platform if he’s back to tweeting up a storm on X?

The timing couldn’t be more critical. Trump Media has been struggling financially, reporting a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter. With stocks already down nearly 50% since its public debut, the pressure is on. 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors are bracing for a pivotal week of inflation data, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) report dropping on Tuesday, followed by the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a slight slowdown in July’s PPI, expecting a 0.1% monthly increase compared to June’s 0.2%. This could be an early indicator that inflation pressures on producers are easing, which might bring some optimism to the markets ahead of the CPI release.

As it stands, there’s a nearly even split among investors on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with current odds at 48%, down from 52% just a short time ago. All eyes are on these reports as they could heavily influence the Fed's next steps and the market's direction.

# Before Market Open:

* **Home Depot** ($HD) is one to watch as it gears up to report earnings. The home improvement giant saw a major boost during the pandemic, with folks stuck at home taking on DIY projects. But with the stock flatlining this year, investors are nervous that the renovation boom may be fading. This earnings report could set the tone for Home Depot’s performance for the rest of 2024. Analysts are expecting $4.50 earnings per share (EPS) on $43.38 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile, **Tencent Music Entertainment** ($TME), a subsidiary of Chinese tech titan Tencent Holdings, is also in the spotlight. As a powerhouse in China’s music industry, TME has been eyeing global expansion, bolstered by its 8.6% stake in Spotify and a recent partnership with Universal Music Group. Investors will be eager to hear more about the company’s growth strategy. The consensus forecast is $0.16 EPS on $996.68 million in revenue.",08-12-2024

# CPI Report to Test Markets

# CPI Showdown: Traders Brace for Big Market Swings

Wall Street’s version of a summer blockbuster is about to hit: the much-anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) report drops this Wednesday. And with it, traders are prepping for some serious market turbulence. The options market is signaling a potential 1.2% move in either direction for the S&P 500 ($SPY), reflecting the anxiety that's been building as inflation numbers approach. After last week’s rollercoaster—where the VIX spiked to levels not seen since the pandemic—the CPI could either calm nerves or send the market into another tailspin.

# Volatility Takes Center Stage

It’s been a summer to forget for investors, but the drama is far from over. Last week, the S&P 500 managed to claw back some losses after Monday’s 3% plunge, thanks to the unwinding of a massive yen carry trade that rattled global bond markets. But don’t pop the champagne just yet—options pros are still not buying the recovery. Contracts betting on a 10% drop in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days are at their priciest since October. Even Jerome Powell’s upcoming speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium isn’t expected to ease the tension.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury is also back to pre-jobs report levels, wiping out most of its recent decline. This suggests that traders are far from convinced that the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes are done crimping the economy. As Sage Advisory’s Thomas Urano put it, “We’re at an inflection point where bad news is suddenly good news because it might force the Fed to pivot.” But if Wednesday’s CPI data comes in hotter than expected, we could see another round of stock market whiplash.

# Powell, Tech, and the Recession Watch

Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech and Nvidia’s ($NVDA) earnings report later this month are the other two major events traders are watching like hawks. The options market is already pricing in similar moves for both dates, but what happens Wednesday could set the tone for the rest of the month—and possibly the rest of the year.

Meanwhile, the labor market continues to be a mixed bag. The yield curve between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes briefly normalized, a signal that has preceded every recession in the past 50 years, only to invert again as recession fears receded. With unemployment ticking up to 4.3%, well above Fed forecasts, the upcoming August jobs report will be just as crucial as the CPI in determining the Fed’s next steps.

So, what’s the bottom line? The market is at a crossroads. If the CPI comes in cooler than expected, it could confirm hopes for a Fed rate cut in September, potentially giving stocks a much-needed boost. But if inflation remains stubborn, expect more volatility and a possible retest of recent lows. As Brooke May of Evans May Wealth warns, “The economy isn’t as bad as people think, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see more downside for stocks in the coming weeks.”

# This Past Week In Markets

**Monday:** Investors kicked off the week with dread thicker than your average Monday blues. The previous Friday’s dismal jobs report had everyone wondering if the Fed could avoid steering us straight into a recession. Spoiler alert: The markets tanked like they had no intention of hitting the brakes.

To make matters worse, a lesser-known carry trade involving the Japanese yen blew up at the worst possible time. Wall Street's clever trick of borrowing yen to buy dollars backfired when the Bank of Japan decided to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years—right as the Fed was thinking about cutting rates stateside. The result? Traders scrambled, portfolios got a beating, and red dominated the screens.

**Tuesday:** Cue the dramatic comeback. Markets rebounded almost as fast as they’d dropped, with investors eyeing Monday’s mess as a prime buying opportunity. The year’s gains made it clear that Monday’s slide was just a bump on the road, so staying the course was the play of the day.

**Wednesday:** The week’s rollercoaster continued with a strong start that quickly fizzled out. Stocks slid again, but Wall Street pros weren’t panicking—they were shopping. Wells Fargo gave a thumbs up to large-cap stocks, Bank of America ($BAC) said it’s time to hunt for value, UBS suggested cozying up to gold and the Swiss franc, and Goldman Sachs ($GS) reminded everyone that diversification is the name of the game.

**Thursday:** And then, boom—markets soared on a surprisingly positive employment report. Jobless claims came in better than expected, sparking hope that last week’s ugly jobs data was just a fluke. The S&P 500 ($SPX) saw its best day of trading since 2022, a whiplash from the worst day since 2022 just a few days earlier.

**Friday:** After a week of wild swings, the markets ended on a high note, clawing back most of the earlier losses. The S&P 500 gained 0.47%, the Nasdaq added 0.51%, and the Dow inched up 0.13%. Despite Monday's steep sell-off and the market's sharpest drop since 2022, Thursday's rally helped turn the tide, fueled by better-than-expected jobless claims. Oil prices also saw a significant uptick, closing out the week with more than a 4% gain, driven by easing recession fears and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

**The Bottom Line:** Volatility is the name of the game right now, and while it might be tempting to bail before the next downturn, keep your cool. Stay focused on the long term, lean on dollar-cost averaging to smooth out the ride, and look for those quality buys amid the chaos.



# On The Horizon

# This Week

After a quiet stretch, the economic action is about to heat up. The star of the show? Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which serves as the market's go-to gauge for inflation.

Before that, Tuesday gives us a glimpse into the manufacturing scene with the Producer Price Index (PPI). Thursday turns the spotlight on July’s retail sales, showing us how Americans are spending their cash. And to cap off the week, Friday’s University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey will reveal how people are feeling about the economy.

# Buffett's Treasury Holdings Surpass the Federal Reserve

# Buffett’s New Side Gig: Competing with the Fed

Warren Buffett’s latest power move? Outdoing the Federal Reserve at its own game. Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK) has now amassed more short-term U.S. Treasurys than the Fed itself, holding a whopping $234.6 billion in T-bills by the end of June. That’s an 81% leap from the $130 billion they had stashed away at the end of last year. Meanwhile, the Fed is lagging behind with a mere $195.3 billion in these government-backed IOUs.

So, why is Buffett—normally the stock market's biggest cheerleader—piling into Treasurys? The short answer: guaranteed returns. With yields hovering over 5%, Berkshire is set to pocket a cool $12 billion in annual interest, all while dodging state and local taxes. It's the ultimate “risk-free” investment for a guy who’s seen it all.

# The Oracle Goes All-In on Safety

But this isn’t just about earning some easy cash. Buffett’s massive T-bill stash suggests he’s not seeing many juicy opportunities in the stock market right now. In fact, Berkshire has been offloading stocks for seven straight quarters, including a big slice of its Apple ($AAPL) holdings. This has some Buffett-watchers wondering: Is the Oracle of Omaha turning bearish on the U.S. economy?

Or maybe, just maybe, Buffett’s biding his time for something big. The man has a history of pouncing on market dips with massive acquisitions, and with a cash reserve like this, he’s ready to strike when the iron's hot.

# Sitting on a Pile of Cash

Whether he’s waiting for the next big buying opportunity or simply playing it safe, one thing’s clear: Buffett’s in no rush. With T-bills offering over 5% returns, he’s making money while he waits. And given the current economic jitters and stock market rollercoaster, who can blame him?

So, while the Fed might be scaling back its holdings, Buffett’s cash fortress is growing. And as usual, when Buffett makes a move, the rest of us can’t help but wonder what’s coming next.

# Earnings Highlights

# Reddit Rides the AI Wave

Reddit is cashing in big time. In just its second earnings report since going public in March, the social media forum crushed Wall Street’s expectations. Q2 revenue soared 54% year-over-year, hitting $281 million and easily outpacing the predicted $254 million. The star of the show? Reddit’s AI data licensing business, which catapulted its “other revenue” segment up a staggering 691% to $28.1 million. Not bad for a company that’s still getting its sea legs as a public entity.

# Robinhood Rides the Meme-Stock Wave

Robinhood is riding high on the latest meme-stock mania. The trading platform smashed Wall Street’s expectations in its Q2 earnings report, with revenue hitting $682 million—well above the anticipated $643 million. The big driver? A surge in meme-stock and crypto trading, which pushed transaction-based revenue up by 69% to $327 million. Not bad for a company that’s been navigating choppy waters since its IPO.

# Novo Nordisk’s Weighty Problem 

Novo Nordisk had a rough day. The Danish pharma powerhouse saw its stock tumble 8.27% after missing the mark on earnings from its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. While the company posted a Q2 net profit of $1.86 billion—a 3% year-over-year increase—both drug sales came in below analyst expectations. Wegovy raked in $1.7 billion, falling short of the $2 billion forecast, and Ozempic sales also missed by $0.2 billion. Investors weren’t thrilled with the slimmer-than-expected numbers.



# Disney’s Streaming Magic Soars, but the Parks Hit a Speed Bump

# By the Numbers: Disney's Q3

* **$23.16 billion**: Total revenue, beating the $23.07 billion estimate.
* **$1.39**: Earnings per share, topping the expected $1.19.
* **$47 million**: Profit from combined streaming services (Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+).
* **6%**: Decline in U.S. parks’ operating income.
* **4%**: Overall revenue growth year-over-year.

# Streaming Triumph

Disney ($DIS) just scored a major win, beating Wall Street’s expectations for its third-quarter earnings. The highlight? Disney’s combined streaming services—Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+—finally turned a profit, hitting this milestone a quarter earlier than predicted. With a $47 million operating profit compared to a $512 million loss last year, the entertainment giant’s pivot towards streaming is paying off big time.

CEO Bob Iger was quick to celebrate this success, especially since Disney's entertainment division has been weighed down by streaming losses for years. The turnaround is also thanks to hits like Pixar’s *Inside Out 2*, which helped Disney’s film studio break a losing streak.

# Parks Cool Down

But it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Disney’s theme parks, long the company’s profit engines, are facing some headwinds. Inflation and flat attendance at U.S. parks put a damper on earnings, leading to a 6% dip in operating income for domestic parks. The company isn’t expecting a quick rebound, forecasting a mid-single-digit profit drop in the upcoming quarter.

Despite the parks’ slowdown, Disney’s overall revenue still grew by 4% to $23.2 billion, topping the $23.1 billion analysts expected. And while the parks might be struggling, Disney is banking on its entertainment and streaming divisions to carry the load moving forward.

# Looking Ahead

To keep the streaming momentum going, Disney is hiking subscription prices, with increases up to 25% for its online video services. As for the parks, the company remains optimistic about long-term growth, despite the current slump. Disney is also navigating a potential $5 billion bill to acquire Comcast’s stake in Hulu, with a final decision expected in 2025.

Overall, it’s a mixed bag for Disney: streaming is shining bright, while the parks could use a little magic.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Every Thursday, the US Department of Labor drops its initial jobless claims report, a snapshot of how many folks filed for unemployment benefits the week before. Normally, it’s a routine release that doesn’t cause much of a stir. But in today’s jittery market, it’s taken on new significance. Last Friday, a disappointing jobs report triggered a stock market sell-off, with investors fearing the labor market is cooling off quicker than the Fed anticipated. Tomorrow’s report could either fan those flames or bring some much-needed relief to nervous traders.

**Thursday:** Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

# Before Market Open:

* **Eli Lilly ($LLY)**: Riding high on the success of Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly is the toast of the obesity drug market right now. The stock’s sky-high valuations reflect investor confidence, but they’ll need to see the company deliver the goods with a solid profit boost to justify the optimism. Wall Street is mostly bullish—15 out of 18 analysts say buy—but it’s all eyes on earnings. Consensus: $2.70 EPS, $9.95 billion in revenue.
* **Yeti ($YETI)**: Remember when Yeti coolers were the must-have post-pandemic accessory? Those days may be fading, but the brand isn’t backing down. After a tough year of slipping shares, Yeti is shifting its focus to international markets. Investors are looking for proof that this strategy will pay off, especially with stronger margins translating to better profits. Consensus: $0.63 EPS, $452.29 million in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Sweetgreen ($SG)**: Sweetgreen is surfing multiple waves right now—value-conscious consumers tired of fast food and a broader shift towards healthier eating. The stock has surged over 144% in 2024, with analysts predicting even more upside. But that optimism hinges on Sweetgreen’s ability to keep delivering strong results, especially with the company’s push into automated restaurants. Consensus: -$0.10 EPS, $180.91 million in revenue.
* **e.l.f. Beauty ($ELF)**: Since its 2016 IPO, e.l.f. Beauty has built a loyal following with its affordable, high-quality cosmetics and savvy social media game. But with inflation pressuring consumer wallets, the big question is whether e.l.f. can sustain its growth. Investors are watching closely to see if the company can continue to thrive in a tougher economic climate. Consensus: $0.85 EPS, $301.44 million in revenue.",08-08-2024

# Is It Safe to Breathe Again, Investors?

If your inbox was flooded yesterday with anxious messages from friends fretting over their stock portfolios or colleagues worried about their 401(k)s, you weren’t the only one.

# Is the Storm Over?

Monday's market madness had investors around the globe in a frenzy, thanks to a perfect storm of economic jitters. The chaos started with unsettling employment data hinting that the Fed’s efforts to cool the economy might be working too well. Add to that a massive unwind of a popular carry trade in Japan and some AI-related profit-taking, and you had a recipe for a sea of red in the markets.

But just as quickly as the losses came, they started to fade. Tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft, which were among the biggest losers yesterday, have already bounced back into positive territory.

# Staying Steady in Unsteady Times

So, is the storm over? Not so fast. While yesterday's selloff seemed more about fear than fundamentals, the broader economic landscape remains shaky. The Fed hasn’t budged on interest rates yet, despite growing speculation that they’ll roll out a hefty rate cut in September to calm things down.

Wall Street pros are warning that we’re likely in for more turbulence before any rate cuts materialize. And though a half-point cut seems to be the consensus, these are the same folks who predicted six rate cuts at the start of the year—so take their forecasts with a grain of salt.

# The Takeaway?

Don’t let market swings scare you into cashing out. Analysts stress that volatility is no reason to hit the eject button, especially after the strong gains we've seen this year. A little bumpiness is par for the course.

And if we’re not at the market’s bottom yet, this might just be the chance to buy into sectors like AI, which have been sky-high in recent months.

In short, hang tight and keep your cool.There are plenty of other things to lose sleep over, like whether your favorite streaming service is about to hike prices again or why that meme stock you bought for fun is suddenly your biggest holding.

* Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and Sam Altman, accusing them of straying from the organization’s mission to develop AI that benefits humanity. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Musk previously filed and then dropped a similar lawsuit.
* Groq, a startup producing chips to power AI models, raised $640M in a new funding round, bringing its total to over $1B with a $2.8B valuation.
* SunPower has filed for bankruptcy and plans to sell off its assets.

# Google Gets the Monopoly Hammer: What’s Next?

# The Verdict Is In

In a ruling that could shake up the tech world, a federal judge has declared that Google ($GOOGL) is, indeed, an illegal monopoly. Judge Amit Mehta didn’t mince words, stating, “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” This is a major win for the Department of Justice, which has been chasing Google for years, accusing the tech giant of smothering competition in search and advertising.

But hold your horses—this is just the beginning. The next phase will decide what happens to Google. Will it be slapped on the wrist with a fine, or could it face a breakup? While the latter sounds juicy, it’s probably not going to happen. Google’s appealing the ruling, so this could drag out longer than your latest Netflix binge.

# Big Tech's Turn in the Hot Seat

Google isn’t the only tech giant sweating right now. Amazon ($AMZN), Apple ($AAPL), and Meta ($META) are all facing similar antitrust scrutiny. Regulators argue that these companies have been acting like playground bullies, pushing around smaller rivals and favoring their own products. The Google ruling could set the stage for how these cases unfold, but whether it’ll lead to actual change remains to be seen.

# Investors Hit Snooze

While the ruling is big news, investors don’t seem too concerned. Alphabet’s stock dipped a bit with the rest of the market but quickly bounced back. Analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives aren’t expecting any major disruptions to Google’s operations in the near term, so it looks like business as usual—for now.

So, what’s next? We’re all just waiting to see if this ruling will actually make a dent in Google’s search dominance or if it’s just another chapter in the ongoing saga of Big Tech vs. The World.

# Uber’s Q2 Earnings Shift into High Gear

# By the Numbers

* **Earnings per share (EPS):** 47 cents (vs. 31 cents expected)
* **Revenue:** $10.7 billion (vs. $10.57 billion expected)
* **Mobility Gross Bookings:** $20.6 billion (up 23% YoY)
* **Delivery Gross Bookings:** $18.1 billion (up 16% YoY)
* **Net Income:** $1.02 billion
* **Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs):** 156 million (up 14% YoY)
* **Total Trips:** 2.77 billion (up 21% YoY)

# Zooming Past Expectations

Uber ($UBER) put the pedal to the metal in Q2, delivering earnings that sped past Wall Street’s forecasts. The company reported 47 cents per share, outpacing the expected 31 cents, while revenue came in at $10.7 billion, topping predictions. With its mobility unit seeing a 23% surge in gross bookings and delivery bookings rising 16%, Uber’s growth engine is firing on all cylinders.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was riding high, noting that Uber’s monthly active platform consumers reached 156 million, a 14% increase from last year, with 2.77 billion trips during the quarter. The market took notice, sending Uber’s stock up 10.9% following the report.

# Looking Ahead

For the third quarter, Uber is forecasting gross bookings between $40.25 billion and $41.75 billion, with adjusted earnings expected to land between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion. While the midpoint is just shy of analysts' estimates, it still signals that Uber expects to keep cruising along smoothly.

# The Road to Autonomous

Khosrowshahi didn’t shy away from addressing Tesla’s ($TSLA) potential robotaxi threat. He assured investors that Uber’s partnerships with Waymo and other AV players put it in a prime position to dominate the autonomous vehicle space. Uber’s platform, he emphasized, is unmatched in its ability to offer AV companies the scale they need without the headache of building their own network.

After a rough start to the year, Uber’s stock is gaining traction. With a focus on innovation and expansion, Uber seems ready to stay ahead in the race for the future of transportation. 

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

With recession jitters on the rise, all eyes are on the labor market. But while jobs bring in the cash, it’s the way Americans spend it that really tells the story. As spending slows—thanks in large part to sky-high inflation—companies start to feel the pinch, forcing McDonald’s to keep those $5 deals on the menu a bit longer.

That’s why tomorrow’s consumer credit report is so important: it’s a snapshot of not just how much people are spending, but also how much debt they’re piling up—the good (mortgages) and the not-so-good (credit cards). Normally, this report flies under the radar, but this time it could be key in shaping monetary policy in the coming months.

**Wednesday:** Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

# Before Market Open: 

* Disney ($DIS) has hit some turbulence lately, with sky-high prices at theme parks, fierce streaming competition, and cautious consumer spending weighing it down. But recent box office wins have revived some optimism, and Wall Street still believes in the Magic Kingdom: 21 out of 26 analysts rate the stock as a “buy,” with a target price about 40% higher than its current level. Consensus: $1.19 EPS, $23.05 billion in revenue.
* Shopify ($SHOP) has had a rough 2024, with its stock nosediving due to worries over slowing consumer spending, challenging economic conditions for small businesses, and declining revenue. Investors are eager for signs of a turnaround this quarter, and given the stock’s current valuation, it might just catch the eye of bargain hunters. Consensus: $0.20 EPS, $2.01 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* Robinhood ($HOOD) blew past analyst expectations last quarter, delivering an EPS of $0.18 versus the expected $0.05. Investors are crossing their fingers for a repeat performance this quarter, though volatility in cryptocurrencies—a favorite among Robinhood traders—could put a dent in trading revenue and profits. Consensus: $0.15 EPS, $631.82 million in revenue.

"This Past Week In Markets ⚡️ 07/29 - 08/02 - 🍎 Buffett Takes Massive Bite of Apple
+ Fed faces the heat + earnings for this week* This past week in the markets was a rollercoaster ride, with a mix of optimism and sharp declines. The week started on a positive note for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, propelled by anticipation of tech earnings, while the Dow struggled to keep up. However, the tide quickly turned as tech stocks saw a significant selloff ahead of major earnings reports, dragging the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower.
* Despite a brief midweek rally fueled by strong semiconductor earnings, the markets ended on a sour note. Economic data revealed worse-than-expected jobless claims, leading to the biggest decline of the year for the Dow and continued losses for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

# 🍎 Buffett Takes a Massive Bite Out of Apple — Slashing His Biggest Stake In Half

Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, just made a move that’s got everyone scratching their heads—he slashed Berkshire Hathaway’s ($AAPL) stake in Apple by nearly 50%. That’s right, the man who’s famous for his buy-and-hold strategy just went on a selling spree, chopping his beloved Apple shares down to $84.2 billion. But when you're Warren Buffett, even after cutting back, you're still holding a pretty hefty portion.

# Apple Picking in a Bull Market

So, why did the Oracle suddenly go on a tech diet? Back in May, Buffett hinted that a bit of Apple selling might make sense if capital gains taxes were on the rise. But this isn’t just a small trim—it’s a full-blown pruning. Apple shares surged by 23% in the second quarter, riding the wave of investor excitement over artificial intelligence. With Apple’s stock flying high, Buffett seized the moment to cash in, perhaps seeing a rare opportunity to capitalize on the tech giant’s lofty valuation.

Berkshire’s Apple sell-off is part of a broader trend. The company unloaded more than $75 billion in equities last quarter, boosting its cash reserves to a record-breaking $277 billion. That’s the financial equivalent of stockpiling for winter—Buffett’s clearly preparing for something, or maybe just playing it safe with a market that’s been a bit too hot to handle.

# Berkshire’s Defensive Play

Buffett’s been tightening his belt across the board. Alongside Apple, he’s been downsizing his second-largest holding, Bank of America ($BAC), shedding $3.8 billion worth of shares in a mere 12 days. And it’s not just about cashing out—it’s about making sure Berkshire isn’t overexposed if things go south. By trimming these top holdings, Buffett is spreading out risk, ensuring that no single stock dominates Berkshire’s portfolio.

Even with all the selling, Buffett’s love for Apple hasn’t waned. It remains Berkshire’s largest stock position, and the 93-year-old investor has praised the iPhone maker for its strong pricing power and loyal customer base. But this sell-off suggests that Buffett might be taking a more cautious stance, preparing for potential turbulence in the market—or just making sure Berkshire’s cash pile is ready for whatever opportunities or challenges lie ahead.

# What’s Next for the Oracle?

So, what’s driving Buffett’s sudden shift from stocks to cash? Analysts speculate that Buffett could be getting nervous about the U.S. economy or stock market valuations that are starting to look a little frothy. After all, the S&P 500 has been on a tear, reaching new heights as investors bet on a “soft landing” for the economy. But with a weaker-than-expected jobs report and rising concerns about whether the Federal Reserve has waited too long to cut interest rates, Buffett’s cautious approach might just be the right call.

Buffett’s long-time strategy has been to hold onto great companies for the long haul, and Apple has been one of his crown jewels. But with nearly half of that jewel now polished off and Berkshire sitting on a mountain of cash, it’s clear that Buffett is ready for whatever comes next—whether it’s a market correction, a buying opportunity, or just a little more peace of mind in uncertain times.

In true Buffett fashion, the Oracle has played his cards close to the vest, leaving us all guessing what his next move might be. But one thing’s for sure—when Warren Buffett makes a move, the world pays attention.

# Fed Faces Heat After Disappointing July Jobs Report

July’s scorching heat didn’t just make your weekend plans unbearable—it also put a damper on the U.S. job market. Last month’s job growth took a nosedive, adding just 114,000 jobs, a far cry from the 185,000 expected by economists. And with the unemployment rate inching up to 4.3%—its highest since October 2021—everyone’s looking at the Fed and asking, ""What’s the hold-up?""

# The Job Market’s Report Card: A Solid D+

If the U.S. job market had to bring home its July report card, let’s just say there wouldn’t be any celebratory pizza dinners. With only 114,000 jobs added, the numbers were well below what anyone was hoping for. This sluggish growth, coupled with a rise in unemployment, has triggered the Sahm Rule—a recession signal that economists definitely didn’t want to see flashing red right now.

But not everyone’s hitting the panic button. Claudia Sahm, the economist behind the rule, argues that we’re not necessarily plunging into a recession just yet. Unusual economic conditions, including the lingering effects of the pandemic, have skewed the numbers. So, while the job market’s cooling off, it’s not quite time to batten down the hatches.

# Powell Under Pressure: Time to Cut Rates?

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell might want to rethink his summer vacation plans. After the Fed opted not to cut interest rates at its latest meeting, Powell hinted that a September rate cut was possible—if more data suggested inflation was under control. But with July’s job report looking lackluster, critics are wondering how much more data Powell needs before taking action.

Wall Street wasn’t happy either. The Dow plunged over 900 points, and the S&P 500 had its worst reaction to a jobs report in nearly two years. Senator Elizabeth Warren didn’t hold back, either, tweeting that Powell should “cut rates now—not wait six weeks.”

Looking ahead, the market is so confident in an upcoming rate cut that you’d think it’s already in the bag. Citigroup and JPMorgan are even betting on half-point cuts in both September and November. If Powell needed a push to make a move, July’s job report might just be it.

# This Week

After a turbulent week filled with economic announcements, next week appears set to offer a bit of relief. While a few data releases—such as July's ISM services on Monday, June's trade balance on Tuesday, and June's consumer credit on Wednesday—are on the calendar, none are expected to significantly impact the market. The spotlight, however, will be on Thursday's initial jobless claims report. Given how this week's job figures shook investor confidence, these reports are now critical in signaling the market’s potential direction.

❗️The Market Just Flipped the Script

For the last couple of years, we’ve been living in an upside-down world where bad economic news was actually good news for investors. The logic? If the economy looked rough, the Fed might ease up on those pesky interest rates. But now, we’re back in the real world—bad news is just…well, bad.

Let’s talk numbers: The latest employment data is out, and it's not pretty. Unemployment has crept up to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. Employers added a measly 114,000 jobs in July, a far cry from last year’s monthly average of 251,000. It’s like expecting fireworks and getting a sparkler.

But wait—there's a twist. Some experts are saying that the rise in unemployment is due to temporary layoffs, so this could just be a blip rather than the beginning of a downward spiral. Still, the S&P 500 ($SPY) didn’t take the news lightly, dropping around 2% in what might be the biggest market slump over jobs data in two years.

The Fed’s Tightrope Walk Just Got Trickier

If you’re scratching your head wondering why the market had a meltdown over a job report, here’s the tea: Investors are spooked that the Fed might have overdone it with the rate hikes. The delicate balance between cooling inflation and keeping the economy afloat is starting to look more like a juggling act with one too many balls.

Here’s where it gets juicy: Just yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential rate cut in September. But with this latest job data, economists are now betting the Fed might have to slash rates even deeper than anticipated. Think of it as the Fed hitting the brakes a little too late, and now everyone’s bracing for a bumpy ride.

Despite the drama, analysts are urging investors to keep calm and carry on. Volatility might be making a comeback, but that’s par for the course as the Fed gets ready to shift gears.

In short, the market’s mood just did a 180, and we’re all buckled in for whatever comes next.

Earnings Olympics: Winners and Losers

This week’s earnings reports felt like a high-stakes competition, with some companies nailing their routines while others took a tumble. Let’s take a look at who’s bringing home the gold and who’s licking their wounds.

Intel’s Bad Day

Intel ($INTC) had a week so rough, it could use a hug. The chipmaker saw its stock nosedive by 26.06%—its worst single-day performance since the Nixon era—after missing earnings expectations left and right. Revenue fell short at $12.83 billion versus the anticipated $12.98 billion, and EPS was a jaw-dropping 80% lower than expected at just $0.02. To top it off, Intel announced a 15% workforce reduction, meaning 15,000 employees are getting the pink slip.

Apple Bites Back

On the flip side, Apple ($AAPL) kept the doctor away with some solid numbers. The tech giant reported $85.78 billion in revenue, outpacing expectations of $84.38 billion, and EPS hit $1.40, beating the $1.34 forecast. iPhone sales made up nearly half of Apple’s total revenue, but the real MVP was the iPad, with sales skyrocketing 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion.

Amazon’s Mixed Bag

Amazon ($AMZN) gave investors a rollercoaster ride, plunging 8.78% despite a mostly solid report. The company missed on revenue, pulling in $147.98 billion compared to the $148.76 billion expected, but managed to beat EPS estimates with $1.26 versus the anticipated $1.02. While its ad business grew 20%, it still didn’t meet the $13 billion sales target, clocking in at $12.8 billion.

Carvana’s Comeback

Carvana ($CVNA) was the comeback kid of the week, with shares surging after an earnings surprise. The online car dealer reported an EPS of $0.39, smashing the expected loss of -$0.12. Revenue also cruised past expectations at $3.41 billion, up 15% from last year. The cherry on top? Carvana sold 101,000 vehicles this quarter, a 33% increase year-over-year.



Microsoft’s AI Miss

Microsoft ($MSFT) had a mixed day, staying mostly on target but missing the mark on AI. The tech titan reported EPS of $2.95, barely above the expected $2.94, and revenue of $64.73 billion, edging out the $64.44 billion forecast. However, its “intelligence” cloud revenue, which includes its AI efforts, came in at $28.5 billion, just shy of the $28.7 billion target, leaving investors less than thrilled.

In the chaotic world of earnings, one slip can send stocks tumbling, while nailing the numbers keeps you in the winner's circle.



On The Horizon

What’s Coming Next Week:

After a rollercoaster of economic announcements, next week is shaping up to be a much-needed breather. We’ll get a few data points—July ISM services on Monday, June trade balance on Tuesday, and June consumer credit on Wednesday—but nothing that’s likely to shake the market’s foundation.

However, Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims report is the one to watch. Given how this week’s job numbers rattled investors, these reports are becoming key indicators for where the market might head next.



Earnings to Watch:

With 70% of the S&P 500 having already spilled the tea on their quarterly earnings, and Big Tech mostly out of the way, you’d think we could relax. But no, there are still some big names reporting next week that you’ll want to keep an eye on:

Monday: Tyson Foods ($TSN), Hims & Hers Health ($HIMS), Palantir Technologies ($PLTR), The Carlyle Group ($CG)

Tuesday: Caterpillar ($CAT), Uber ($UBER), Marathon Petroleum ($MPC), Yum! Brands ($YUM), Planet Fitness ($PLNT), Amgen ($AMGN), Airbnb ($ABNB), Reddit, Wynn Resorts ($WYNN), TripAdvisor ($TRIP)

Wednesday: Disney ($DIS), Novo Nordisk ($NVO), Sony ($SONY), Shopify ($SHOP), CVS Health ($CVS), Hilton Worldwide ($HLT), Lyft ($LYFT), Monster Beverage ($MNST), Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD), Robinhood ($HOOD), Duolingo ($DUOL)

Thursday: Eli Lilly ($LLY), Brookfield ($BAM), US Foods ($USFD), Six Flags Entertainment ($SIX), Yeti ($YETI), Under Armour ($UA), Warby Parker ($WRBY), Krispy Kreme ($DNUT), Paramount Global ($PARA), Sweetgreen ($SG)

Friday: Hawaiian Electric Industries ($HE), Getty Images ($GETY), Canopy Growth ($CGC), Soho House & Co. ($SHCO)

**Fed Keeps Rates Steady, But September Cut Looms**



Jerome Powell took center stage at the Fed’s July meeting, setting the scene for what could be a rate-cutting September—if the data plays nice. While Powell didn’t drop any explicit hints, his optimism on falling inflation and a cooling labor market has Wall Street betting on a September rate decision.

Here’s the scoop:

September Cut in the Cards? Powell kept things ambiguous but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The Fed had a “nice conversation” about it, and while a 50 basis-point move isn’t likely, Powell left the door open for action if conditions warrant.

A Delicate Balancing Act: Powell described the decision-making process as a “very difficult judgment call,” outlining scenarios from multiple cuts to none at all. The plan? If inflation keeps easing, growth holds steady, and the job market doesn’t fall apart, a cut could be on the horizon.

Dovish Vibes: Powell’s remarks leaned more dovish than the official FOMC statement. With inflation risks decreasing and the labor market softening, he’s still banking on a soft landing for the economy.

Market Reactions: The stock market loved it, with the S&P 500 inching towards its best day since February. Treasury yields dipped, and the dollar slid as traders began pricing in at least two rate cuts by year’s end.

Patience, Grasshopper: Despite the growing anticipation, Powell emphasized patience. The Fed’s dual mandate—curbing inflation while keeping employment high—requires careful maneuvering. Investors might need to wait for the weather (and rates) to cool down.

So, as summer sizzles on, the Fed’s next move is still in the oven. Keep an eye on those labor market stats and inflation readings; they’re the key ingredients for what happens in September.

  
**Meta's Q2: The Zuck Strikes Back**

Meta ($META) is having a moment. Shares popped nearly 7% in after-hours trading after the company not only beat Wall Street’s expectations but also threw down a strong forecast for Q3. So, what’s driving the hype? Let's dive in.

By the Numbers

Earnings per Share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected

Q3 Revenue Forecast: $38.5 billion to $41 billion

Ad Revenue Growth: 22% year-over-year

Reality Labs Loss: $4.5 billion this quarter

Operating Margin: 38%, up from 29% a year ago

2024 Share Performance: Up 34% year-to-date

Core Business Keeps Delivering

Despite all the chatter about the metaverse and Reality Labs burning through cash like it’s going out of style (a $4.5 billion loss this quarter, no less), Meta's core business—digital advertising—continues to deliver. Ad revenue alone soared 22% year-over-year, driven largely by the Facebook and Instagram power duo. That’s more than double what rival Alphabet ($GOOGL) pulled off with its ad sales.

On the spending side, Meta's AI and virtual reality ambitions are no small potatoes. The company is shelling out big bucks on infrastructure, with expenses expected to surge even more in 2025 as they continue to scale up. But with AI being the buzzword of the year, investors are keeping a close eye on when those hefty investments will start paying off.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's head honcho, is bullish. He’s not only talking up Meta AI as potentially the most used AI assistant by year-end but also boasting about their Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (because nothing says futuristic like AI-infused eyewear). Plus, Meta’s open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is making waves in the tech world, pushing the company to the forefront of the AI race.

The Reality Labs Money Pit

Even with all this success, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Reality Labs, Meta’s bet on the metaverse, is still a money pit, and the legal bills are piling up too. The recent $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition data is a reminder that Meta's past still haunts it.

But for now, Zuckerberg's 2023 ""year of efficiency"" mantra is paying off. Meta’s operating margin jumped to 38%, and the company’s cost-cutting measures seem to be hitting the right notes with investors. With shares up 34% for the year, double that of the Nasdaq, Meta's comeback story is one for the books.

**On The Horizon**

All eyes were glued to the FOMC announcement today, but now that the dust has settled, things are cooling off as we head into the rest of the week. We’re still on the lookout for updates with weekly jobless claims, which will shed more light on the labor market, while Q2 nonfarm productivity, ISM manufacturing, and the S&P US manufacturing PMI will offer insights into how the manufacturing sector is faring this month.

On the earnings front, there’s still plenty of action to keep an eye on.

**Before Market Open:**

Anheuser-Busch Inbev ($BUD) has seen its stock slide over the last year, largely due to a customer boycott following a controversial ad campaign. Adding salt to the wound, competitors like Diageo are also reporting weaker alcohol sales as consumers tighten their belts. Despite these challenges, BUD's brand power remains strong, and Wall Street is still optimistic, with an average analyst price target 26% higher than current levels. Expectations: $0.87 EPS, $13.56 billion in revenue.

Ferrari ($RACE) might seem like it’s in the same boat as other luxury brands dealing with consumers cutting back, but not so fast. Ferrari buyers aren’t feeling the pinch of inflation like most folks, and analysts believe the company will keep raking in the profits. Expectations: $2.23 EPS, $1.74 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close:**

Apple ($AAPL) made waves in June at its WWDC event, unveiling AI projects, new phone upgrades, payment services, and more. This earnings report will give investors a closer look at how these new ventures are impacting the bottom line. Wall Street remains bullish, with just one out of 35 analysts rating Apple a “sell.” Expectations: $1.34 EPS, $84.36 billion in revenue.

Amazon (AMZN) hasn’t seen the same sky-high gains as some other tech giants this year, but investors are still confident in its cloud business, post-pandemic profitability, and AI initiatives. And if you thought the love for Apple was strong, every one of the 39 analysts covering Amazon rates it a “buy.” Expectations: $1.03 EPS, $148.57 billion in revenue.",08-01-2024

# Microsoft’s Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade

In a classic case of “so close, yet so far,” Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company’s disappointing Azure cloud revenue.

Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints

Microsoft’s revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure’s performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue—just shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub’s impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn’t enough to quell investor concerns.

By the Numbers

Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected

Market Reaction and Future Outlook

While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft’s other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure’s growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn’t enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft’s shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500’s 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market’s laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

**Chips Ahoy! AMD’s Data Center Sales Surge 115%**

AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let’s break it down.

Earnings Breakdown

AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street’s expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter

AI Chips and Data Center Dominance

The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company’s overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.

Other Segments and Market Reaction

While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD’s business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year

AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.

**On The Horizon**

Tomorrow’s labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let’s be honest, they’re all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week’s job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.

**Before Market Open**

**Boeing ($BA)**: Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.

**Marriott International ($MAR)**: The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close**

**Meta Platforms ($META)**: Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta’s spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

**Arm Holdings ($ARM)**: With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm’s valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",07-30-2024
"Market Recap Today 07/29/2024The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed higher on Monday, boosted by anticipation around upcoming tech earnings. This optimism comes despite last week's selloff triggered by Tesla and Alphabet. Meanwhile, the Dow couldn't find its footing and ended the day in the red.

Treasury yields mostly held steady, dipping slightly before the session's end as investors await the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday.

Rate Cut Countdown — Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger?

Nope, the Fed isn’t cutting rates this week. But don’t snooze just yet—this meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn’t overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy—he's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.

Inflation: Cooling Off

Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year’s 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We’re on the right track, folks.
Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it’s taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell’s recent take? The labor market isn’t adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a “sweet spot”—balancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.

Risk Management Reboot

With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed’s risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle—slightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed’s past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they’re determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.

Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it’s time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn’t seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.

The Fed’s balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.


McDonald’s: The Golden Arches Stumble

By the Numbers

Revenue: $6.49 billion (missed $6.61 billion estimate)
Earnings per Share: $2.97 (missed $3.07 estimate)
Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)
U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%
International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%
International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%

McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.

Value Meals to the Rescue

The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn’t translated into higher overall sales just yet.

Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.

Defying the Odds

Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.

Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell.

Looking Forward

The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.

So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

On The Horizon

Tomorrow
Economic Data and Earnings

This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.

Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Before Market Open

Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning’s traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn’t deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.

Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a ""buy"" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.",07-29-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 23/07. includes summary of all the earnings reports, analysis and education, and all the news from premarket.ANALYSIS & EDUCATIONAL:

**At the start of earnings season, this is a reminder to be responsible with your hard earned cash and gains. De risk by trimming positions, size for 0/ use appropriate size in your pre earnings play. Here's what institutions do with earnings:**

* Firstly, institutions will often trim positions before earnigns as I mentioned, as earnigns are uncertain. Normally, before earnigns season, institutions will do some kind of cash raise.
* Remember that cash raise is literally one of the best forms of hedging. You can then look for opportunities in the market. E.g. Last week, ASML fell to multi month low. If you trimmed your ASML position, or if you dont hold ASML, then other positions, heading into earnings, you can buy at these discounts.
* 2. Institutions generally don't buy on earnigns predictions. Does this mean you shouldn't? I'm not saying that. What I am saying though, is understand that pure earnings plays are a gamble. You dont really know FOR SURE if GOOGL will smash it out the park or not, and evne if they do whether the market will receive it well. As such, size small, and if you buy options, buy longer durations so that you dont get killed on weekly calls. Give yourself a damn chance that if the earnings dont go exactly as you planned, you can still get out of the position at Break even. To be honest, you should just buy common shares rather than options. Then furthermore, buy companies that you actually believe in. no point going long on Roblox earnings if you dont like ROblox at all, just because they happen to be reporting. No. buy the companies that if they sell off, you dont mind holding them still, because you know that in 6m theyll be back.
* 3. Look at prior earnings performance, but understand that this is not a fool proof strategy. just ebcause the earnings popped and beat on the last 4 earnings, doesnt mean it will this time. But it is a good sign.
* 4. INSTITUTIONS GENERALLY DONT GUESS THE EARNINGS, BUT THEY REACT TO THE EARNINGS.
* To do so, what they do is they wait for a sell off, then watch the MONTHLY AND WEEKLY EMas for entries. They will watch for pullback for instance to 21Weekly EMA, and buy there for bounce. Or the 9monthly EMA and try to buy there for bounce. But again, in companies that they believe in.
* look here for example. This was ASML. last week they delivered shitty earnings and crashed. But here you see, it PERFECTLY held the 9Month EMA. So watch these weekly and monthly time frames with the key EMA's plotted and watch for pullbacks to these points on high quality names.

"Share your Trading Workstation HistoryMy first trading setup was a 17-inch Asus laptop. I don’t have any pictures of my old laptop. I was only paper trading at that time.

My second workstation was an AMD Ryzen with 32GB of RAM and two 27-inch AOC FullHD monitors.

The third workstation was for trading and programming. The PC was still the same. After my profitable trading streak, I bought myself four 24-inch Iiyama FullHD monitors and a MacBook Pro for journaling.

The fourth workstation was a Mac Mini with a Windows VM. I sold three Iiyamas and bought an LG 5K 34-inch ultrawide monitor.

My fifth workstation is my current workhorse: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, 64GB RAM, and Nvidia 4070TI Super. I ditched the 24-inch monitors and now trade on the LG Ultrafine.

My Next workstation will be a IMAX Projector. /s
I had the dream of having multiple monitors, and I was super excited when I first got multiple monitors. But after several years, I understand that it was not necessary for me. My 34-inch LG has plenty of display real estate. I started small, and with growing profits, I treated myself to better and nicer tools.

"Is crypto bull cycle this time different?Is there something new in this bull cycle that the altcoins are not performing well and are still dry? Layer 1 Blockchains have performed way better than rest of the altcoins.

This bull cycle is giving out a different vibe than the ones we have seen before. Lot of inflows were seen in big projects while the altcoins with low cap still have low liquidity and no serious gains. Your crypto portfolio with big market cap projects would have performed way better than 50x/moon coins.

**What could be the reason?**

1. Experienced investors are reducing risk and going after high liquidity.
2. New retail investors have not entered this bull cycle.
3. Lot of people with shitcoins have converted them into heavy weight coins.

"First week day trading. How did I do? Just to start, I hardly know what I'm doing.  I live in Vegas and this feels like a fricken Casino man.

Does anyone have a good youtube channel and or youtube video to help be gain more knowledge.  What I'm finding is basic regurgitated stuff.  

Apple today for the win.  Had a 212.5 call option this morning that was up more than 300%    

Portfolio was worth 700 (nvida) and I had about 100 in funds to play with.  Now, I still have my nvidia but now I have a few hundred to play with.  

God this is a dang Casino man!

"Thoughts on nvda### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA’s investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA’s market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA’s manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA’s market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",06-12-2024

"DING DING DING MARKET IS CLOSED!!! How much did you make today???Hope yall had a good long weekend and a good first day back in the markets for the week! I made $240 today. I took 3 $1,310 calls on nvidia for .37 each at market open and held a few hours, sold them all for 1.17 for a total of $80 each contract. How did yall do today??",05-28-2024
"How to live with missed potential gains?Im fairly young and dont post alot, and I'm probably lucky for what its worth. I wanted to ask how people just go on knowing had they traded differently they could have so much more. One trade I made was selling nvidia at 530 now its almost doubled. Another trade was buying into gme at 15 it dropping to around 12 for a few weeks and I just wanted out so I sold way otm calls for 18, then It popped to the 72$ range. I'm still really young so missing out on these 2x - 4x gains has just left me sad. I live with myself by saying I'd rather learn these lessons with 20k than with 500k later in life.

"Dell develops new AI computer with Nvidia!





I joined Dell yesterday with a stake of €20,000 and was able to make a profit of €5,000 within a short period of time. Why I believe that Dell still has huge potential! First of all, let's look at the facts. Dell is up over 247% in the last year. Last month it was almost 30%. If you had traded with a 5 leverage, that would be 150% in 4 weeks! Dell has published in the news that they are developing an AI computer. This is great news. In my opinion, they have a huge advantage due to the strategic partnership with Nvidia. Now there are financial releases coming up on Friday and I think the share has the potential to grow between 10-30% in the next 1 to 2 weeks! Here is my reasoning. At the last financial release on February 28, 2024, the share rose by almost 30% within a few days. The estimates of 16 analysts assume that they will achieve sales growth of more than 3% compared to the previous year. The numbers will most likely look good. Added to this is the extremely close collaboration with Nvidia, AI is only just beginning and as a computer manufacturer with a huge market share among companies, Dell could boom. I invested €20,000 myself and was able to make more than €5,000 in profit today alone. This is not intended to be investment advice, everyone is responsible for themselves, but I see Dell as having huge potential and I think you can get a lot of money out of it with leverage!",05-24-2024
"Friday's Markets Update (May 24, 2024)On Friday, stock market was mixed. S&P rebounds and Nasdaq rises, fueled by AI stocks, especially Nvidia. Dow is stagnant after a big drop. Consumer confidence data eases inflation fears. On global markets, Chinese foreign investments continue to decline. BTC and ETH are both flat, hanging below 69K and 3.8K despite ETH ETF approval. The rest of the crypto market is mostly in the green, with Uniswap surging 12%.",05-24-2024
"What typically happens to a stock after a split?Trying to figure out if I should buy 1 share of Nvidia now and have it go 10:1 or should I purchase after the split? I feel like you would get the best value for a share with the split unless historically the stock price will fall post split. After losing like 70% on a reverse stock split with another company I want to be prepared. I didn't have a lot invested but it still pissed me off. 

Also, what happens with stocks that bet against a stock going up? I forget what they are called (I'm not talking about you actually shorting or anything) but these stocks typically do better when a stock does worse. If you invest in that after it goes from say $1,000 to $100 do you get a massive payday or is it sort of reset?

Thanks!",05-24-2024
"Thursday's Markets Update (23 May, 2024)On Thursday, stocks dropped as strong economic data fueled worries about continued high interest rates. Despite the broader sell-off, Nvidia continued to soar on impressive earnings and a stock split announcement. Boeing, however, plunged on production woes. In world markets, gold is sharply down on new dollar strength propelled by the unexpectedly hawkish tone of the FOMC minutes. Crypto prices plunged, with BTC leading the decline by nearly 3% and touching 67K. The broader market mostly followed BTC, with the exception of ETH, which held above 3.7K.",05-23-2024

"Which one produce more retail trader Millionaires ? Stock or forex ?Hi everyone, I first started my trading journey with forex in 2014 . I thought that would be rich quick thanks to exponential interest but ended up losing for 4 years ! 😭 

Then I got rid of my mindset to get rich fast and totally opened my mind to new stuff ! I read a lot of success stories about stock investing and trading! I studied countless of hours millionaire maker stock like Tesla , Microsoft, Nvidia and apple just to name a few! I read many books on stock market too . Then I understood that there  more chance to be successful in stock trading and investing than the famous day trading! I developed a breakout strategy to buy momentum stock when they make new high on weekly chart. It's a momentum sign when the market rise . I will do a post about my strategy soon . I am profitable now!

After all , it's logical because the 2 only factors that are proven to drive a stock price up in the long term are its sales growth and its profits growth! Add a breakout system to it can make the strategy powerful.

I saw some outstanding success stories on the stock markets with traders who turned a couple of  thousands of dollars into millions. 

I exclude crypto because it's pure gambling! I also exclude hedge funds because they are not retail investors and traders like us !

Here are some stock trading and investing outstanding success stories!

Kristian Qullamaggie: turned 9k into $100 million
Jason Debolt : turned 30k to 12 million (Tesla)
Dan zanger :turned 10k into 42 million 
Cis : turned 30 into 300 million 
BNF : turned 13k into 150 million
Tim Sykes : turned 5k into many millions 
Ross Cameron: turned 583 into 11 million 
Keith Gill : turned 50k into 50 million 
Chris Camillo : turned 20 k into 40 million 

These are just some of the countless of incredible success stories from swing trading stocks ! 

I also noted that there are  also thousands of ordinary investors that started from nothing and built a huge wealth for themselves because they are a good stock picker ! Among them some are even billionaires. There's Stewart Horesjsi who became a retail investor billionaire , specially with his bet on Berkshire Hathaway. There is also Herbert Wertheim who is worth $5,3 billion. He made strategic bets on Apple and Microsoft ! These people are not traders ,they are long term investors ! It's to show you the power of the stock market to build wealth for an ordinary investor when he play it right! 

But when I do online research about a retail trader who made millions thanks to forex ,there don't seem to be a lot of positive results! It's weird because there are a lot of gurus that said that they are rich because of forex trading! I know that many are pure fraud!


Tell me if am wrong and if you know some retail traders who made it big in forex ! 

Thanks for your answers and be respectful! 🙏",05-19-2024

"What to expect from Nvidia in the wake of waning sentiment from Mag8 resultsWe are now more like 1/2 way thru the Mag8 earnings reports and after next week, a significant chunk of the S&P components would've completed their calendar Q1 earnings. Nvidia, which has in recent quarters become the darling of Wallstreet having set a benchmark for its GPU chip design, admittedly faces stiff competition from the likes of Groq and Cerebras. 

During the last earning period and the earnings call that followed, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, a true visionary, acknowledged and welcomed this competition suggesting that perhaps AI needs to be its own sector separate sector from Technology. Into calendar Q1 earnings though, what should we expect from Nvidia where expectations from these big tech firms are running rampant? After close today, we have another group of Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel reporting. I'm presenting a daily chart of Nvidia in this post with the hope that into and past earnings, we hold the $765 price area which should help build the momentum it needs to see 4-digit price. For the options strangle minded individuals on here, Fib support now sits between 709\~765.

While this is not a ""**Day Trading**"" specific post, selling 1100/700 35-45 DTE strangle could potential deliver some decent results if you are able to sneak this trade in closer to the earnings date of May 22.

I can also notice lag and slight delays in the chart especially in the one minute as i can just tell the software is lagging/freezing.

I am assuming this is because at market open a lot of data starts getting processed by the application and processor as the L2 and tape starts running fast and everything on the platform starts moving really fast.

Is this laptop not powerful enough to support that many charts and L2 etc at market open? I think 16 GB was sufficient along with a powerful CPU/GPU.

Bought calls/puts when someone on social media said to buy/sell and as u might have guessed it didnt work  at all. and Might have lost over 15k doing just that. So i was very anxious /scared to put my money in options but seeing everyone's gain porn in other subs made me question myself, ""why cant i do what they are doing?""

This feeling of feeling small and less than someone else didnt sit right, so started watching technical analysis videos, day trading subs and followed alot of tiktok live traders. I have gained few brain cells doing just that.

I know it looks like someone had a diarrohea, so i turn on and off some of them to see better picture. The Chandlier exit gives me buy and sell signal, but only mostly buy when the volume is green candles above 30 day average and MacD is green! Even that dosent bode well all the time but has been very successful so far. But i'd like to add that my success might mostly be due to NVDA and SMCi having such crazy moves of upto 35%  gains/loss on a single day. 

I have made about 25k + among three different account just in last 2 weeks. Here is a snap of one of that below!

Again, I have to recognize this was possible only because of the stocks NVDA and SMCI were having such crazy moves and have ended some day in small losses when they went sideways as well. This would be almost impossible to replicate on a daily basis.

I want to trade options on a daily basis or atleast few times a week! There wont always be such huge moves in the stocks always and even if there is, how would one find one before that happens? How do i screen stocks proficiently? Also, besides hoping for stock price to go up during the option play, what do you all see/verify before buying them calls/puts?

And finally, How else do you guys think i should improve?

Any help/suggestion will be taken in consideration, and thanks for the help in advance!!",02-24-2024

"Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings play and caution for later.The charts below are NVDA 1 minute when earnings were released last time (21st November 2023) As you can see, it's a violent move and a pure gamble if you are in beforehand, IMO.  

The second chart is the NVDA 5-minute chart, on the day of earnings. I am predicting an inside-ish day on NVDA, which could be great for scalpers/day traders.  

I will avoid the earnings release, as that's gambling IMO. But I will look to trade a smaller size once it settles after hours. 

Levels-wise, I will be watching the $750 on the upside; after that, we have no levels to look at. Downside $670

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21**ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google’s where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

——

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. 
* Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. 
* We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. 
* Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023. 
* Japan Balance of Trade Numbers:
* Overall balance of trade was less negative than expected. 
* Exports grew more than expected up 12% YOY, ahead of expectations of 9.5%
* Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected.
* This means more exports and less imports, points to greater demand for JPY. Would expect JPY to rise on this. But JPY down on Japanese gov downgrades and business survey weakness. 
* Australia Wage Price index:FASTEST PACE OF RISE In 15 YEARS. 
* YOY comes 4.2% vs 4.1% forecast. Last quarter’s data revised up to 4.1% from 4%.
* QOQ comes 0.9% vs 0.9% forecast. 
* Hotter than expected wage data points to stickier service inflation and thus, a more hawkish RBA. 
* UK Record budget surplus for January:
* UK Chief secretary says that they still won’t speculate if tax cuts are affordable or not in the budget. 
* US mortgage demand numbers:
* Mortgage demand takes a hit, interest rates cross back over 7% on reduced rate cut expectations pushing up bond yields. 
* EU Consumer Confidence NUmbers:
* Later we have FOMC minutes - likely reveals more of what we know, continue to explain that we need to see more of the same data to be confident of cuts. Slight hawkish tone probably. 
* FED SPEAKERS: BOSTIC speaks, as does Bowman. 

**MARKETS:**

* SPX - yesterday, found support around 4955, before recovering back to 4977. Before Europe opened, was trading at 4972, dropped slightly on European open as FTSE100 sold off. 
* Nasdaq: Slightly lags SPX and DJI. This is due to the big sell off in PANW. Low of day yesterday was 17,400, before recovery to 17,550. Lower in premarket,. 
* DJI - Trading at around 38,500 in premarket, slightly down, at the low of the day from yesterday. 
* HKG market higher today on cutting of loan prime rate. Was up almost 4%, as high as 16,800, before paring some gain to 16,460. 
* China meanwhile is up 2% to 11,890. Key level here will be the 12k level, which it was rejected off of. 
* GER40: low of yday was 17,020. Trading quite flat. Today got a bit of a boost at open and is up 0.42% to 17062. This comes as we are seeing higher open interest on 17.5k
* UK market down 1%
* Gold higher again on softer dollar and Middle East geopolitics - 5th consecutive green day in a row. 
* OIL: down 0.8%. Little bit of correction here, as was trading 78.5 yesterday. Volatility is persistent but skew keeps higher, just with more hedging. 
* Bond yields slightly lower ahead of FOMC minutes later. 

**FOREX:**

* AUD was higher on hawkish wage data. 
* Dollar was lower into the FOMC minutes, pared slightly. 
* EURUSD and GBPUSD slightly lower back to 1.08. 
* GBPUSD fell and retested 1.26. 
* AUDUSD pushing up towards 0.66 but pared the gains. 
* USDJPY steady around 150

The post asked an important question: can raw price data and price-based technical indicators (Simple Moving Average, Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, etc) be used and optimized to create a successful trading strategy?

It looked like nobody really knew the answer, and a lot of it was speculation. So, I decided to test this out myself! I created a portfolio with 64 different strategies. The strategies consist of buying and selling rules for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Nvidia, and TQQQ.

Here is an example of a ""rule"":

>Strategy to Buy NVDA:  
>  
>\- Action: Buy  
>  
>\- Amount: $500 worth of NVDA shares  
>  
>\- Condition: The strategy activates if 0+ days have passed since the last NVDA buy, 0+ days have passed since the last NVDA sell, and if ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. NVDA's price is less than or equal to its 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) minus 0.5 times the 30-day Standard Deviation (SD).
2. NVDA's price is less than or equal to its 7-day SMA minus 0.5 times the 7-day SD.
3. NVDA's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is less than 35.
4. (NVDA's price - 30-day NVDA SMA) divided by the 30-day NVDA SD is less than 0.
5. (NVDA's price - 30-day NVDA Exponential Moving Average (EMA)) divided by the 30-day NVDA SD is less than 0.
6. NVDA's 10-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is greater than the 100-day NVDA EMA.
7. NVDA's 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is greater than the 100-day NVDA SMA.

I then optimized these rules using [multiobjective genetic optimization](https://nexustrade.io/blog/mathematically-improve-your-trading-strategy-an-in-depth-guide-20240103). This algorithm should theoretically be able to create a population of enhanced strategies with their own strengths and weaknesses. I optimized the objective functions ""percent change"" and ""maximum drawdown"".  With this process, I created a portfolio that does EXTREMELY well in backtests. For example:

[Backtest Result for the Ensemble Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/7ykxyr2uttdc1.png?width=2986&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2a35eccbb50f756dffe3e45f39ee9fde6bbed6)

Now the next step is to paper-trade this. I can post regular updates if you guys are interested, or just post updates every couple months.

# Things I learned Creating This Strategy

The biggest thing I learned is that trading strategy optimization is **VERY** expensive. Typically, when I optimize strategies, I only optimize 2-3 strategies with very simple rules. This experiment was the polar opposite and wow! I upgraded my cloud instance multiple times and still blew it up! In the end, I had to optimize the portfolio locally on my max-specced MacBook M3 Pro Max, and then do a migration to transfer the portfolio to the cloud. And this is only with 64 trading rules! Imagine if it had 640 rules! I would need a legit supercomputer.

Happy to answer any questions about the experiment! Overall, I'm very excited about this experiment and extremely curious to see how it performs compared Buy and Hold. The strategy is an aggressively bullush strategy, and we're already at all-time highs, so I'm definitely conscientious about a crash that's just waiting to happen. But we'll see what happens! 😃

"Advice on holding short positionsI'm looking for advice on short positions, often i have a bad habit where i go short without setting a stop loss hoping that the price will return to that level, then the price continues to climb up, recent example is Nvidia breaking new all time high.

"Trading intuition exist, or am I just getting lucky?Hi, I started investing 3 days ago and plan was to invest in nvidia but I discovered a penny stock with a lot of potential and decided to put $30 into it. The next day, when the market opened, I sold at the peak and doubled my money. Later that day, when people panic sold near the market close, I bought back the same amount of stock for the same price.

Today, I did the same thing again, though with slightly less profit. I’ve been focusing on just this one stock because the whole thing feels so surreal. I was literally sitting on the toilet, and with one click on my phone, I doubled my money, lmao. The next day, I almost tripled it again.

It kind of bugs me that I only put in $30, but at the same time, it feels like gambling just with better odds.",12-20-2024
"Portfolio TalkHello all, after months of my own research I've made a portolio. I want to preface this by saying this is not a post looking for advice. I am just wanting to tell you all the investments I've made and the reasons behind them. Also, there is some overlap between my individual picks and my ETF picks. I know.

**First, the foundation**

Like any smart investor you need a solid base. Something that will grow steadily and won't make you want to sell out when there is an inevitable market crash. This is why for my first pie, I have gone with 80% VUAG and 20% IGLA.

**Tech Focus**

People may say that my portfolio is too heavily weighted towards the USA and tech, I think the tech giants like Apple etc are not going anywhere. So my allocations are as follows,

Amazon- Moving into the AI space with Nova, Revenue growing steadily YOY.

Microsoft- Almost in the 'too big to fail' category. Not going anywhere and an easy choice IMO.

Alphabet- Recovered well and quickly after 2022 crash. Massive AI player. Easy choice

Apple- Still most popular in the Phone space. Can only see this stock going one way.

Meta- Absolutely flying in recent years. Hopeful Zuck will keep it up.

ASML- Riskier pick but believe they will have a good year next year. Looking 4-5 years into the future with this one.

Nvidia- Don't think I need to say too much with this choice. Looking long term, very excited about this one.

IonQ- Main player in quantum computing space, looking at some volatile years upcoming but I have faith that they could be huge in 5+ years.

**Consumer Focus**

Costco wholesale- Almost unshakeable business model, no strong competition IMO.

Pets at home- Smaller allocation for this one. Seems undervalued to me as people are always going to treat their pets. Will keep tabs on this one as still unsure.

Procter and Gamble- Been around for a million years. Very stable with dividend growth YOY.

Walmart- Consumer powerhouse in USA, strong financials and IMO not going anywhere,#

**Finance Focus**

Berkshire Hathaway- Trust in Buffett, no pressure from short term market trends.

Intuit- Dividend growth YOY, in an incredible place financially.

JP Morgan and Chase- In the 'too big to fail' category in my opinion. Involved in so many industries so not dependent on one for revenue.

MasterCard- Very able to adapt to the market, only risk is inflation IMO.

PayPal- After share price crash in 2022. Revenues didn't faulter and net income bounced back within the year. Undervalued IMO.

S&P Global- Adapting well to new tech such as AI. Been around forever.

**Real Estate Focus**

Realty income- Unshaken by the market crashes in past 20 years. Dividend Growth YOY.

VICI properties- Predictable revenue due to triple net leases. In a strong financial postion.

I think I have a good mix of sectors and stability/growth. I am not looking for advice but will take onboard any criticism.

Thanks all.",12-08-2024

Plus I am not an economist or anything related to investing so I feel that I have been really lucky and I don't know if it will work on the long term.,10-16-2024
"Why NVIDIA (NVDA) is Likely to Hit $150 SoonNVIDIA (NVDA) has been enjoying a wave of positive momentum, driven by several major developments in its AI and chip businesses. Over the past week, multiple reports have highlighted the strong demand for NVIDIA’s AI chips, particularly the next-generation Blackwell GPU, which is already sold out for the next 12 months. This demand is a key indicator that NVIDIA's AI dominance will continue, pushing the stock higher.

Morgan Stanley, after meeting with NVIDIA executives, reaffirmed a bullish outlook, projecting a 12% upside based on surging demand for AI inference computing and NVIDIA’s ability to provide increasingly sophisticated GPU solutions to major players like Microsoft and Meta. The firm has maintained its ""Overweight"" rating and sees the stock hitting $150 by the end of the year​

In addition to these developments, NVIDIA's continued innovation in AI energy efficiency and its robust partnerships with companies like Foxconn are also boosting market confidence. With AI poised to revolutionize industries, NVIDIA's leadership position in AI hardware places it in an excellent position for further growth. These factors suggest that NVDA could easily reach or surpass $150 by the end of the year.

# Aroon Indicator for NVDA shows an upward move is likely

NVDA's Aroon Indicator triggered a bullish signal on October 11, 2024. Tickeron's A.I.dvisor detected that the AroonUp green line is above 70 while the AroonDown red line is below 30. When the up indicator moves above 70 and the down indicator remains below 30, it is a sign that the stock could be setting up for a bullish move. Traders may want to buy the stock or look to buy calls options

"I'm releasing GPT-Stock Report – an organized list of AI-Generated stock reports for every US stock I've been using Large Language Models to help me analyze companies with a great amount of success. What I usually do is use a financial API, get the fundamentals for the stock, and ask ChatGPT to analyze the company for me.

For example, I've used this approach to [analyze NVIDIA's earnings](https://nexustrade.io/share/66f76cab234274af62911107) earlier this year and made a ton of money on call options.

However, finding new stock opportunities has been tough. So, I decided to do something a little crazy.

"TSMC Earnings Ahead: Could this cause NVDA to reach new highs?With TSMC set to announce their earnings and guidance soon, I’ve been reflecting on how this might impact NVIDIA) stock. TSMC, as one of NVIDIA’s key partners, often provides valuable insights into NVIDIA's demand and sales. If TSMC reports strong earnings, it could indicate robust demand for semiconductors, which is crucial since NVIDIA relies heavily on TSMC for manufacturing its GPUs. Positive news from TSMC might lead to increased optimism for NVIDIA’s prospects and influence overall market sentiment toward tech stocks. A solid report could create a ripple effect, boosting investor confidence not only in TSMC but also in NVIDIA.

Following TSMC's earnings, analysts may *revise* their ratings or ***price targets*** for NVIDIA, potentially leading to a **spike** in NVDA’s stock price.

Additionally, with the growing demand for AI and gaming, TSMC's earnings could highlight trends that further support NVIDIA’s growth, especially if they mention strong orders from clients in these sectors. Reports indicate that TSMC is now able to ship more chips than ever before.

Do you believe TSMC’s earnings will positively impact NVIDIA? Are you planning to make any moves based on this news? Let’s discuss!",10-09-2024

[Studies show that LLMs perform financial analysis better than actual financial analysts.](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BFI_WP_2024-65.pdf) For fun, I wanted to see what Claude and GPT thought of NVIDIA's earnings.

Here's the information I fed into the models:

* Balance Sheets
* Earnings
* Cash Flow statements
* Ratios (P/E ratio, P/S ratio, etc)

(Note, this information is fetched in the backend and injected into the prompt).

Both Claude and GPT independently rated NVIDIA's earnings a 5/5 despite its high P/E and P/S ratio!

**Claude's Summary**

Pros:

1. Exceptional revenue growth and profitability
2. Strong cash flow generation
3. Robust balance sheet with high cash reserves
4. High efficiency in converting sales to profits
5. Strong return on equity and assets

Cons:

1. High market valuation might lead to increased volatility
2. Potential for increased competition in the AI chip market
3. Cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry

Recommendation and Rating: 5/5

**OpenAI's Summary**

**Pros:**

* Strong profitability with high margins and return on equity.
* Excellent liquidity position with a high current ratio.
* Strong cash flow generation, exceeding net income.
* High Piotroski F-Score indicating robust financial health.

**Cons:**

* Negative change in working capital, which could impact liquidity if not managed properly.

# Recommendation

Based on the financial data, NVIDIA appears to be in excellent financial health with strong profitability, liquidity, and cash flow metrics. The high Piotroski F-Score further supports this positive outlook. However, potential investors should keep an eye on the change in working capital.

**Rating: 5/5**

I believe that AI will make financial analysis **wayyy** easier for retail investors who are just learning how to analyze a business. What do you guys think? Would you trust AI for to analyze stocks?

* [**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - Earnings yesterday, beat expectations but weren’t the blowout everyone expected. Executives said on the earnings call that NVDA still expects to begin earning revenue from Blackwell in this fiscal year. EPS of 0.68 vs 0.64 exp. $50B share buyback. Revenue grew close to 122% YoY. Overall, I don’t really see a reason to change one’s position if long/short. (I’m not changing mine, which is currently long.) Consensus EPS is $.64, but of course, future outlook will decide the move. This will pretty much decide the direction of the market for the next few days because we traded close to flat for the past week.

I guess I'm looking for advice.   
  
Given the current trajectory of the economy and the fear of a recession, should I sell all my current stocks, then buy when everything goes lower to minimize my current losses?

I've been caught in a mix of waiting for it to go lower and prices increasing slightly, buying then it going lower. Right now, things have just been on a steady decline, especially after the Japanese fiasco. I'm only down 130 dollars but I am unsure if I should just take that loss and wait for a much bigger dip.

Now with that in mind, there are many differences from now and the 60s but it’s a good thing to notice. Another point is that if Kamala Harris is a good candidate, the VIX will most likely increase since it’s the volatility:fear index throughout the market. This also affects the s&p and such. I think in this case we are going to see a little pump due to the sudden change and impact we have seen in the past week alone. Nasdaq might still go down with tech stocks seeing a little decrease, also presented in the CrowdStrike incident and the Taiwan-Trump situation with Nvidia.

"Thoughts on nvda### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.

"You May See Wrong % Value in Your Brokerage AccountAs people started posting and asking questions why they see their portfolio is down I decided to provide explanation.

"Can someone explain what happened?Hi, I'm new to the world of trading. I've recently started studying since I was planning to start trading in the next months,and I downloaded an app to train doing paper trading.

Things were going really well, I made way more than I lost and everything was looking pretty good. I was holding the trades that would've lost money and selling those where I was satisfied. Make no mistakes, I know that in real trading it won't be easy cause emotions are a thing and I probably just got lucky, I try as hard as I can not to get too excited,cause I know that it could cost me a lot.

When I started I put 500$ with a 1:5 leverage on NVIDIA, and it was initially going up,but I decided not to sell . Then it started to go down,and I chose to hold to see if I could recover something, but today I found out that NVIDIA did a stock split (1:10).

I thought that wouldn't have been a problem since the value of what I bought shoud've stayed the same,but the market went down by 400% today,and I dont know why.

What am I missing? I read about the in coming split some days ago and I didn't pay much attention to it, I didn't expect the consequences to be this. Why did this happen? Is there something I misunderstood or a market mechanism that I'm not aware of?",06-10-2024
"Will the Nvidia split be an unintentional pump and dump. So I am very new to trading. Still don’t understand a lot about investing. So far I’ve really enjoyed researching and learning about companies to invest in. I’ve built up a small portfolio without a single full share. 

The company I have the most in is Nvidia and I’m really interested is what’s going to happen tomorrow with the split. 

It seems like most people are anticipating the value of Nvidia a shares to go up but is it going to go up and stay up or is it going to go back down. If it goes back down when will that likely happen. Just wanting to hear what people say about it. Thanks in advance.

"Thoughts on clothing stores and fashion brands...In light of Abercrombie's performance over the past 12 months I'm very interested to see what happens in the fashion and retail industry.

If you hadn't noticed, **Abercrombie (NYSE:ANF) is up 436% in the past year.** Comapre that to Nvidia (197%) and bitcoin (167%) and it amazes me more people aren't shouting about this stock and the fashion industry as a whole.

I've got my eye on a few fashion brands at the moment and I'm interested to hear what people's analysis is on the following:

* More expensive brands are down over 12 months: Burberry -55%, Mulberry -55%, Gucci -35%, Hugo Boss -33%... Are they now good value?
* Mid / low price point brands are up: GAP +212% Levi's +73%, Adidas +46%, H&M +33%... Will they keep rising as many are 75% of all time highs still

These swings are massive!

What is everyone predicting for the next 12 months? Will the luxury brands bounce and return to their previous levels once the economy improves? Or is shopper's attitude changing towards luxury brands forever? Is China playing a massive part in this?

Hugo Boss seem to be opening a lot of stores, they've just signed David Beckam, and they are aiming their BOSS line at a lower end of the market now that Frasers are calling the shots. Are these really good value stocks at the moment? I think so. I also like Adidas a lot.

"I created a system to deploy virtually any trading strategy without code. Here's how it woks.[I created an algorithmic paper-trading system.](https://nexustrade.io/) One of the features I like to tout is the ability to create, backtest, and deploy virtually any trading strategy that you can imagine. 

However, most people don't understand how it works. Even worse, they don't believe that with this architecture, you can create ***literally any*** trading strategy.

So I wanted to take some time to explain how it works. For a full, detailed writeup, [check out this article.](https://medium.com/p/395488640777)

# What do I mean by trading strategy?

When I say trading strategy, I mean a simple rule for entering and exiting the market. A strategy as an **action**, an **amount**, an **asset**, and a condition. When the condition is triggered, the strategy executes the action. For example:

>Buy $1,000 of NVIDIA if it’s price is less than its 30 day Simple Moving Average

The action is ""buy"". The amount in this example is $1,000, but it can be 10 shares, or 10% of the portfolio value. the asset is NVIDIA stock, and the condition is if NVIDIA's price is less than NVIDIA's 30 day Simple Moving Average.

The challenging part in creating a system to configure any trading strategy is controlling when the action is triggered. Maybe you want a strategy to execute 3 days after a solar eclipse. Or, maybe you want it to trigger when CPI is 0.3% points higher than expectations. How could you configure that?

# The condition: a tree in sheep’s clothing

[A condition is just a special-type of syntax tree](https://preview.redd.it/04h7ttlbyutc1.jpg?width=888&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5c485fd9aafcdb9be0be139b95215082b83ccf3d)

A condition evaluates into a boolean statement, like true or false. We need a way to express ANY boolean statement without requiring code. How could we do that?

We can do this by representing a condition as a tree.

Think of a tree like a way to organize data. It’s similar to a family  tree with your grandparents at the top, your parents below them, and  their children (your siblings) below them.

Essentially,  we want to evaluate the entire tree. If the end result is true, we will  execute the strategy’s action. If it’s false (or if there’s an error),  we stop and move on to the next strategy in the portfolio.

We have BaseConditions, which are the leaf nodes of the tree. They represent logic like the above: if NVIDIA's price is less than NVIDIA's 30 day Simple Moving Average. They don't depend on any other conditions; just the raw observations about the market. 

Then we have CompoundConditions, which are like the parent nodes of the tree. Compound Conditions, like compound sentences, combine two or more independent conditions. We use them to represent *And* and *Or* boolean logic.

Finally, we also have Compound Indicators, which are ways to combine the raw observations about the markets using mathematical operators. 

Bringing everything together, we have a system that can configure any trading strategy that you can imagine.

And, because it's just a tree, we can use an LLM to generate a syntactically-valid JSON that corresponds to the tree. In other words, we can convert plain English text into a configuration that the app understands!

# I still don't understand! A tree??

I didn't want this Reddit post to be much longer than it is right now. [I wrote up this article which goes into more details on this tree-like structure and how its applied to algorithmic trading](https://medium.com/p/395488640777). I'd love to take questions! ",04-11-2024

    from backtesting import Strategy
    
    class MLStrategy(Strategy):

            y_tomorrow = self.model.predict(X_today)
            
            if y_tomorrow > RMSE:
                self.buy()
            elif y_tomorrow < -RMSE:

"Four simple strategies to try to become a profitable traderThere was a top post today that declared “it’s a waste of time daytrading”, which got a bunch of upvotes. 

I don’t agree with the sentiment. I’ve been trading for four years (profitable for the past two) and I think that people spend too much time looking for the “Holy Grail” that they ignore basic strategies that *work*.

So here are 4 strategies you can try on nearly any brokerage platform.

# Buy and Hold & Dollar Cost Average
I chose to include these two despite them being so simple. Trading requires you to come up with your own hypothesis of the market. For example, “I think AI is going to outperform the broader market”. You then choose to buy stocks that correspond to your hypothesis.

You don’t have to daytrade to make money. Stocks that are KNOWN to be heavily involved in AI include [Microsoft](https://nexustrade.io/stock/MSFT), [NVIDIA](https://nexustrade.io/stock/NVDA), [Amazon](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AMZN), and [Google](https://nexustrade.io/stock/GOOG). They all have great fundamentals, so if you believe in AI, you can choose to buy those stocks.

If you’re even more bullish on AI, you can choose to buy leveraged assets like [TQQQ](https://nexustrade.io/stock/TQQQ). Again, you have to be smart and strategic. 

# Mean Reversion
Some stocks stay at a certain range. Look at [Intel](https://nexustrade.io/stock/INTC), [Square](https://nexustrade.io/stock/SQ), or even [Apple](https://nexustrade.io/stock/AAPL). You can trade these type of stocks by buying at the weekly/monthly low. If they keep falling, buy more. Again, this only works with stocks that **you think (eventually) should go up**. You don’t want to be a bag holder.

# Momentum
If a stock is in a certain range for a while, and all a sudden, it has earnings and has a giant move up, you should be paying attention. This is called momentum. Stocks that move up tend to continue doing so. An amazing example of this is [COIN](https://nexustrade.io/stock/COIN) and [HOOD](https://nexustrade.io/stock/HOOD). They were flat and at their lows for a while until they started moving up rapidly. HOOD in particular had their first profitable quarter and expect to reach full-year profitability. That's amazing momentum, especially prior to their earnings run-up.

# Conclusion
I don’t want to pretend to be an expert, but I am profitable. Learning how to trade is a skill, and different people have different strategies. I use a combination of technical and fundamental metrics to guide my decision. What do yall use?

"Is day trading possible in australia?I recently started experimenting with the stock market and purchased a Nvidia share for $780, which has now appreciated to roughly $890 (USD). This profit has led me to think if it is possible to earn a living from trading stocks.
Is it possible to day trade in Australia and make a profit? By that, I specifically mean trading US stocks. 
Would it be easier to do swing trading instead?

Also, please tell me a good broker as currently I'm using moomoo app, which takes 1 usd per order.

I'm a complete begineer so any advice would be appreciated.",03-07-2024

**News:** [Nvidia Rally Rekindles AI Frenzy in Stocks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-21/stock-market-today-dow-s-p-live-updates?srnd=premium)

**Not much to watch today besides the AI stocks.** 

**NVDA-** Blowout earnings and we broke past that $750 level I was interested in. From here? I genuinely don’t know where we’re going to go, but obviously still worth watching for the foreseeable future.  Will be watching $800 level closely. This has dragged SMH/SOXL/AMD/the entire market up with it.

**RIVN-**Poor earnings, laying off 10% of workforce, Lucid production has underwhelmed. Musk has posted that he expects Rivian to go bankrupt in about a year and a half. Projected to product 9k vehicles, down from 14K.

**SMCI-** We’re making another leg up- thinking of making a small long from 900, but other than that I don’t want to be short until we break previous highs

https://preview.redd.it/ljukczy5n5kc1.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dd2f0073f15e16334084dc2ddb2a59b3cbb066a

**AMD-** Up in conjunction with NVDA, small level I’m watching around 180-181- nothing clear cut. 

https://preview.redd.it/265l9nman5kc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0faea9e6b737eb85e0e5bbe0b71fa82c70800d7e

**Earnings today: BKNG, EIX, NE**",02-22-2024
"NVDA testing support...next stop $630.00?What goes up must come down...if this support breaks I think we get back to around $630.00. That's where it was before it ripped higher early this month.

There are probably a lot of people who sold there who will be trying to buy their shares back at their sell prices because of seller's remorse.

If there are enough of these buy orders it will create support.

**NVDA- Earnings today afterhours. This is the most important stock in the market today, and will likely decide whether we continue the AI run-up or not. I’m personally staying hands-off until earnings time.** Also watching AMD, SMH, SOXX, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/jqyz7iddgyjc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ef2bcb61d1d0d67b8a1b50f9f548cd78432bb9

LUNR- A moon lander they own is expected to land later today. Looks like the market doesn’t really care about this news, run-up stock in the past few days.

EDIT: Looks like I might be wrong about LUNR. Would stay away unless we form a clear top to short.

**PANW-** Reported lowering guidance and slower year over year growth. Beat on top and bottom line of revenue.

**RAPT-Reported the clinical hold on drug yesterda**y, and stock was down 60% yesterday. Making a move up today (small in the grand scheme of the stock).

"I bought this fund. Appreciate your advice/comments.
I bought like 250$ iShares World Equity Index Fund (LU) It includes Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon Com Inc, Nvidia Corp, Meta Platforms Inc Class A, Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc Class A, United Health Group Inc and more but Apple has the biggest share in the fund. Fund manager is BlackRock and risk score is 6 out of 7 i guess this is high because all these companies are the biggest in the world so i thought it would be more safer but this risk score i don’t know. Appreciate your advice. I do not need this money in short-term tho but i am wondering is this fund aims to make profit in long term or mid term?

"Riding the AI Wave for all of 2025Disclaimer: Novice investor here.



65/M a couple years from retirement. Besides some investment accounts that are diversified appropriately for my age and situation, I've got an IRA with $150K that I want to roll the dice with. I was going to configure this IRA with a 100% S&P 500 index fund, but now I'm thinking of doing something different.



Instead I want to take the entire $150K IRA and split it up evenly between these 7 stocks:

Alphabet

Amazon

Apple

Microsoft

NVIDIA

Broadcom

Palantir



My plan is to keep this portfolio for all of 2025. Then in January 2026 I'll diversify it appropriately.



This AI Wave is riding high right now, and I think it has the potential to go even higher before it starts to crest, which presents an opportunity to take advantage of that really doesn't come around too often.



If this 7-stock portfolio can beat the S&P 500 for 2025, I'll be happy. I think it has a good chance of doing so.



Critique this 7-stock portfolio please.

"Can Nvidia continue its rise?Morgan Stanley stated that Nvidia's Blackwell chip will be the company's biggest highlight in 2025, with the success of this next-generation GPU expected to overshadow any remaining investor concerns.

This week, the bank reiterated its ""Overweight"" rating on Nvidia's stock, stating that the chipmaker remains one of its top picks for 2025. The optimism is driven by expectations of the success of Blackwell—Nvidia's next-generation AI chip.

The bank set a target price of $166 per share, a 23% increase from Nvidia's price of approximately $134.82 as of last Friday.

""When short-term data is volatile but the fundamentals are very strong, we are most optimistic about Nvidia. We believe we are approaching that stage now,"" the analysts wrote in their report. ""Despite transitional pressures, by the second half of 2025, the only topic will be the strong performance of Blackwell.""

Investors are already optimistic about the Blackwell chip, which is expected to launch in early 2025. Earlier this year, Nvidia's stock surged after CEO Jensen Huang said the demand for the chip was ""crazy,"" boosting Wall Street's expectations for sustained profitability growth for Nvidia.

Morgan Stanley added that the chip could become the ""core driver of revenue"" in the second half of next year, suggesting ""significant upside potential"" for the stock price.

The success of the new chip could also alleviate some of the short-term to medium-term concerns investors have regarding Nvidia's stock.

Morgan Stanley pointed out that investors are primarily focused on four key issues:

**1. Slowing Production of Hopper Chips**

Investors are concerned about the slowdown in production of Nvidia's current generation AI chip, Hopper. In the latest earnings call, the company forecasted a 69.5% growth in revenue for the fourth quarter, the lowest in seven quarters.

However, Morgan Stanley stated that the slowdown in Hopper chip production is a ""non-issue.""

""The reason is simple: we are a few quarters away from the end of Hopper's lifecycle. We won't directly link Hopper production to revenue because Hopper's revenue will last for about three quarters. Additionally, there is a significant backlog of orders, so now is the time to slow down production,"" the analysts wrote.

**2. Different Versions of Blackwell Chips Not Shipping Simultaneously**

Investors may be concerned that not all Blackwell products will ship at the same time. Nvidia has stated that it will release seven different variants of the Blackwell GPU.

""We have heard concerns that some products may not be ready, and we do not deny that there may be timing challenges for some types of products,"" the analysts said.

They added, ""This is a reasonable concern, but all Blackwell chips will be sold, even if this results in distribution changes among customers. We expect this to continue for a whole year, and it should not be a long-term concern.""

Morgan Stanley stated that by the second half of 2025, concerns about the Blackwell launch will ""completely disappear.""

**3. Competitors Eroding Nvidia's Value**

The analysts noted that in recent months, part of Nvidia's market value has shifted to other chipmakers such as Broadcom and Marvell. These companies produce ASIC custom AI chips, which are alternatives to Nvidia's GPUs.

""But by 2025, we believe the largest users of ASICs will actually shift their purchases back to GPUs,"" said Morgan Stanley. ""While we are relatively conservative in our revenue forecasts for Broadcom and Marvell's ASICs, we believe GPUs will significantly outperform ASICs this year.""

**4. Reduced Chip Demand**

Large AI chip customers are expanding their GPU clusters for more advanced computing. However, some financial supporters question whether the return on investment is worth it, Morgan Stanley noted.

""Both of these aspects are important, and we cannot rule out the possibility of market consolidation in certain areas,"" the analysts said. ""But we note that many of Nvidia's recent innovations have aimed at improving the efficiency of large clusters,"" they added, pointing to Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox, which will help expand its data center market share.

The analysts stated, ""Even with concerns about a cooling arms race in AGI, the growth in inference, sovereign training, and enterprise training applications are multi-year growth drivers, accounting for about 70% of data center revenue. Even if the arms race consolidates, we will still see sustained growth potential.""

Despite Nvidia's stock price having surged 170% in 2024, most analysts remain optimistic about Nvidia in 2025. The continued AI trade frenzy is expected to be one of the major themes influencing the stock market in 2025.

"I'm switching my Mutual funds to NVDA Alright, hear me out—I'm betting big on NVIDIA, and here's why.

We just hit a massive milestone with AGI (yeah, OpenAI confirmed it last night), and Google isn’t far behind. This isn’t just a tech achievement; it’s going to ripple through the entire industry. AI is about to disrupt everything, starting with customer service. Think about it: a $252 billion industry could shift its primary expense to AI tools next budget cycle. Companies will fire up subscription AI agents instead of keeping massive BPO teams. That’s just one example—there are multiple industries that are going to pivot like this.

And guess what? NVIDIA is at the center of it all. Their GPUs are the backbone for every major AI player—OpenAI, Google, xAI, you name it. Demand is already skyrocketing, and NVIDIA is scaling up production like crazy. They’re ready for this surge.

Look, I know it’s risky, but I’m convinced. Connecting supply chain data with real-world news, this feels like a no-brainer. NVIDIA could easily see 30%+ growth in the next year, especially with the industries piling in. This isn’t just hype; it’s logic based on the people involved and the breakthroughs we’re seeing.

Am I taking a big bet? You bet. Let’s see where this ride takes us.

"NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New RallyNVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

https://preview.redd.it/ok73jyoabk7e1.png?width=4274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdb19d0e917d566e957a8693d65590b1adecf12

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

https://preview.redd.it/2kg8hm6dbk7e1.png?width=4276&format=png&auto=webp&s=5917df78a1bf3692f719dc35622f9ad823fab4ba

  
From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible. ",12-18-2024
"Which Quantum Stock to invest in? Avoid QUBTFollowing on from my [recent DD ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hadjii/quantum_computing_inc_is_going_to_crash/)on Quantum Computing Inc (QUBT), a lot of messages and a 70% rise in share price that has cooked my puts, I decided I'd dive a bit deeper

# QUBT does not have leading quantum physicists or innovation.

[Monroe has more talent in his pinky](https://preview.redd.it/gk9l4glffb7e1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=645bae223cfaf7054b06f4fedcb50cb42b941647)

Similar to when evaluating biotechs, in the quantum computing industry you need to consider the academic and publishing background of employees. Quantum Computing is a pioneering area of science, innovations are typically borne out of research conducted by universities and research centres that are published and reviewed. As I explained in my past post, QUBT's staff did not attain their Phds at leading universities (something which is **very important** given the quantum computing academic field is relatively small and nascent). Furthermore, even if you thought they might be diamonds in the rough - their publication records indicate that they are abysmal researchers (see above). The citation count of QUBT's entire (quantum) employee count is unable to match the citation count of individual founders from competing firms. This is a clear indication that their 'innovations' and patents are likely to fail commercially.

# For every technical staff member at QUBT, there is $42million in market capitalisation.

[Bearish signal: Big capital raises and no hiring](https://preview.redd.it/fjc1l70jfb7e1.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e59911426fa5b04bad519efa0bfea459b1f221f)

Furthermore, even if I was agnostic on education and publishing background, just from a headcount perspective, they do not have the people. They are the smallest of the four leading small cap quantum firms. And despite capital raises, including a recent [$50 million capital raise](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/11/quantum-computing-inc-announces-50-million-from-stock-offerings-to-support-photonic-chip-foundry/) and booming stock price, they have not shown signs of new hiring. The current market cap of $1.33 billion appears unsustainable, and works out to $42 million per technical staff member - that's more than my dad made in his entire life.

# Where has the money gone?

If you believe what the company is saying, the money from their recent capital raises are going into a foundry dedicated to processing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) chips for use in quantum computing.

There are a number of commercial lithium niobate suppliers, and unlike what they claim on their [website](https://quantumcomputinginc.com/learn/research-and-publications/thin-film-lithium-niobate-tfln), suppliers do exist in countries other than China - see [Switzerland](https://lightium.com/), [USA](https://www.samaterials.com/niobium-compounds/66-lithium-niobate-wafers.html), [UK](https://gandh.com/products/crystal-optics/lithium-niobate-wafers). Given the relative obscurity of QUBT's employees, it is unlikely that they'll manage to either make functioning chips ([which they are already falling behind on](https://iceberg-research.com/2024/12/09/qubt-is-already-running-behind-with-its-new-chip-manufacturing-hype/)) or beat out their competitors who possess significantly more valuable patents, better manufacturing capability and greater commercial links (i.e. with Amazon, Nvidia, Google).

Also here is what Quantum Computing Inc’s foundry [looks like](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quantumcomputinginc_qci-foundry-plasmatherm-activity-7247977871216930816-MJtF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios), which notably [Iceberg Research](https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/) exposed them for lying about its size.

# But would QUBT really mislead investors?

QUBT has pivoted many times during its history: from [beverage company](https://iceberg-research.com/2022/10/05/quantum-computing-inc-qubt-on-its-way-to-vacuum-state/), to quantum software, artificial intelligence, and now quantum chips. It naturally begs the question, should potential investors believe QUBT's claims? [Milan Begliarbekov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milan-begliarbekov-33aaa77a/), the chip foundry director, sums up my concerns quite well on his LinkedIn:

"Intel potential comeback?Hey!

Intel seems like a company that's really struggling right now. Their stock just dropped to around $20.16, and it’s not just the GPU market giving them trouble. They’re battling issues on multiple fronts.

First off, their foundry business (where they manufacture chips) is bleeding money – about $7 billion in annual losses! They’re not expected to break even there until at least 2027. On top of that, they’re losing market share to AMD and Nvidia, both in CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia is dominating with AI, and AMD is taking more and more of the gaming market.

It also feels like they completely missed the whole AI boom. Nvidia is raking in insane profits, while Intel seems to be… just watching? And to make things worse, their CEO recently stepped down, which makes their future even more uncertain.

That said, they’ve just launched their new Arc B580 and B570 budget GPUs. Nvidia and AMD seem more focused on AI and data centers right now, so maybe Intel has a shot at carving out a space in gaming? But is that really enough to turn things around?

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising.



And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable—around 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).

"I’ve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. **Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with [the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html) to [attending the company’s GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html) to chatting with [CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like [AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

Individual Stocks: Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca-Cola (KO) are known for reliable dividends.

Growth Stocks (30%): For high growth potential.

Technology (e.g., Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft) or healthcare innovation.

ETFs: Growth-focused ETFs like ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) or Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) provide diversified growth exposure.

"Nvidia replacing Intel in the Dow JonesYou only really needed to understand one thing - linear processing, which Intel was the king of, would no longer be relevant in a world where all of the new technology required parallel processing. Nvidia pioneered parallel processing in their creation of chips for video games. About 10 years ago, this type of computing became necessary for many applications away from the video game console world. Blockchain, augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning and, eventually, artificial generative intelligence. 

Intel never stood a chance. ",11-02-2024

"20 Yrs old. Portfolio Update/AdviceHey guys so i’ve taken some advice from the last time i posted and decided to cut out google from my holdings because i’ve seen the impact that chatgpt has had especially through my experience on my college campus seeing the increased use. I’ve added PLTR before the induction into the S&P after carefully consideration and research I believe that it could be a great player in the future especially after reading about how effectively it reduces the time of underwriting at insurance companies from 2weeks to 2hours. I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity. The last company i worked at (Cigna) uses Crowd-strikes malware scan and in the midst of CRWDs downturn with delta etc i had a good feeling that it would recover. AMZ remains my biggest holding and i think it’s still so undervalued. I’d like to hear your guys perspectives on the balance of my portfolio. In the coming months i want to invest $100-200 a month into VOO, BRK and SCHD but i want to hear opinions because my goal is growth and i have a long horizon and don’t plan on selling.",11-01-2024

"MSFT faces long-term potential disadvantagesI think one of the main reasons Microsoft is a great long-term investment is its long history of generating a lot of free cash flow. At the time of writing, the company's free cash flow margin is over 30%, with free cash flow rising from $15.9 billion in 2009 to $74.1 billion in the last 12 months. This financial strength provides management with the resources to make strategic growth investments.
While Microsoft may not seem like a value investment, in my opinion, its pricing is reasonable given its continued revenue and earnings growth, and it's likely to continue for the foreseeable future. I estimate EPS growth of 13% on a regular basis over the next 12 months. Based on this projection, I have a price target of $482.40 and estimate that the stock will trade at a non-GAAP P/E ratio of around 36.
Looking ahead, I expect Microsoft to achieve an average annual return of 15% over the next 5 to 10 years. While this prospect necessitates buying the stock at a fair valuation, I believe the current price provides an opportunity. The company's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio is only 6.5% above its five-year average, while its forward diluted earnings per share growth rate is nearly the same at 5.8%.
MSFT faces long-term potential headwinds
One potential challenge to Microsoft's long-term growth in AI is that its adoption can be cyclical. Currently, the demand for AI systems is high, which has prompted Microsoft and other big tech companies to invest heavily in data center expansion. However, when the current trend peaks (likely due to macroeconomic constraints), growth may slow. According to the TipRanks risk analysis tool, Microsoft is exposed to 32% risk from legal and regulatory factors, which is higher than the industry average and could impact its AI operations due to increased scrutiny of data privacy and AI governance.
Given this outlook, I expect some volatility in Microsoft's long-term growth trajectory, although it may not be as good as NVIDIA NVDA -0.06% ▼ and so on semiconductor companies so obvious. As market sentiment fluctuates, cyclical price and valuation declines coincide with temporarily lower growth rates and may provide more attractive buying opportunities.
There is also a risk that Microsoft and other Big Tech players could over-invest in AI infrastructure. With 21% of its risk related to Tech & Innovation, Microsoft’s heavy investment in AI-driven initiatives, including data center infrastructure, could result in lower-than-expected returns if industry growth does not meet expectations. This may impact free cash flow margins in the medium term, contributing to further volatility.",10-28-2024

"I'm new to Stock Market and I don't understand stock valuations.
Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing *really* good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises?

Super realistic market analysis by Motley Fool this morning 🙄,09-23-2024
"Qualcomm Approached Intel About a Takeover in Recent DaysQualcomm recently approached Intel with a takeover proposal, marking what could be one of the largest tech deals in recent memory, according to sources. Intel, once valued at over $290 billion, has seen its market cap fall to around $90 billion after a challenging year in which its shares dropped 60%.

While a deal is far from guaranteed, Qualcomm’s interest comes as Intel struggles to recover under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plan, which has yet to deliver significant results. Should Intel be receptive, the deal could face heavy antitrust scrutiny, though some argue it might bolster U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor industry. Qualcomm may consider offloading parts of Intel to complete the acquisition.

Both companies have sought to capitalize on the AI boom, though they’ve lagged behind Nvidia. Intel, grappling with factory delays and cost-cutting measures, is receiving government subsidies as part of its efforts to build chip factories. A Qualcomm takeover could enhance its portfolio by adding Intel’s dominance in PCs and servers to its smartphone chip business.

Despite this potential merger, Intel continues to face major hurdles, including the possible need to split its design and manufacturing operations amid growing calls for the company to separate its business divisions.

Looking further ahead, Oracle projects over $104 billion in revenue by fiscal 2029, along with a 20% year-over-year growth in earnings per share.

Speaking at the Oracle CloudWorld event in Las Vegas, CEO Safra Catz expressed confidence in achieving these ambitious targets, pointing to new partnerships that allow Oracle’s database software to be offered through major cloud providers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Oracle’s strong performance continued this week as its stock gained roughly 15% over the past three trading days, setting a new record and marking a 55% increase for the year—second only to Nvidia among large-cap tech companies.

Oracle’s cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 45% last quarter, outpacing its competitors and benefiting from businesses transitioning their workloads to the cloud. The company is also positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence, announcing its cloud unit has secured orders for over 131,000 next-generation Nvidia GPUs.

As Oracle scales up its cloud and AI capabilities, it plans to double its capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 to support this growth, signaling continued momentum in its expansion efforts.

"New To The Stock MarketAs the title says I'm new to the stock market, and have only been investing in it for about 4-6 months now. I currently have 12 different stocks in my investment portfolio, which I invest $25 into each stock on the 1st and 15th of each month so in total I invest $600/month into the stock market.

"Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positivesThe problem areas in the USA: --------------------------

\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.

\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy, 

\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.

\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.

\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.

Good areas: --------------------------------------

\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see

\*- Gasoline is lower than last year

\*- Retail sales are going fine, \[ per  a recent NPR radio article \]

Nuetral ----------------------------------------

\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.

\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.

"TSM investment?Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment?

Given the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow.

Yes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion.

Yes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.

Trump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.

"Nvidia announces $50 billion stock buybackNvidia said Wednesday that its board of directors has approved a $50 billion stock buyback.

The computer chip giant announced the share repurchase as part of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, in which it reported earnings and guidance that surpassed Wall Street expectations.

Nvidia returned $15.4 billion to shareholders in share repurposes and cash dividends as part of the company’s first half of its fiscal 2025. The company said it had $7.5 billion remaining under its share repurchase plan, as of the end of its fiscal second quarter.

Last year, Nvidia announced a $25 billion share buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results.

Companies often experience a boom to their stock price after revealing stock buyback plans.

In May, for instance, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback as part of its fiscal second-quarter results that showed overall sales fell 4% year over year and iPhone sales dropped 10% year over year. However, the iPhone maker’s shares rose 7% in after-hours trading, likely because Apple’s share buyback was the biggest in corporate history.

With Nvidia’s shares dropping 4% in extended trading despite reporting solid financial results and announcing a stock buyback, some experts believe the company has been doing so well that it is getting harder to impress investors.

Second-quarter sales rose 122% year over year to $30.04 billion, while net income jumped 168% year over year to $16.6 billion, Nvidia said.",08-28-2024
"Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value, first U.S. company outside of tech to do soWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway
 reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first nontechnology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.

Shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The $1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old.


The shares were up 0.8% to $696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the $1 trillion mark, per FactSet.

The milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.”

Unlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen.

"Super Micro Falls as Hindenburg Takes Aim With Short ReportSuper Micro Computer Inc.'s shares took a hit on Tuesday following a short report from Hindenburg Research that questioned the company's financial practices and transparency. Hindenburg's report alleged significant accounting red flags, undisclosed related-party transactions, and potential violations of sanctions and export controls. Initially, the report caused Super Micro's stock to plummet by as much as 8.7%, but it later rebounded to close down 2.6%.

The server manufacturer has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with its high-performance servers in high demand for data centers. This surge in AI-related demand has driven significant growth for the company, doubling its revenue to $14.9 billion in the most recent fiscal year. Despite a steep decline from its March peak, Super Micro's stock remains up over 90% for the year, reflecting continued investor interest in the burgeoning AI sector.

However, the Hindenburg report could intensify scrutiny on Super Micro's accounting practices and client relationships, particularly as the company has faced regulatory challenges in the past. In 2020, Super Micro resolved a U.S. SEC investigation by correcting its financial statements and paying a penalty for accounting issues from 2014 to 2017. As the AI market continues to expand, maintaining investor confidence will be crucial for Super Micro, especially amid concerns about the profitability of AI-optimized servers and the potential for increased regulatory oversight.

"Is The Market Aware of the Risks Behind Nvidia's Upcoming Earnings?This Wednesday, AI giant Nvidia is set to release its highly anticipated financial report. Investors are eagerly looking forward to it, with high-performance expectations and hopes for the stock price to reach new heights.

The market widely expects that Nvidia's revenue for the second quarter will double year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. In the past few quarters, Nvidia's performance has continued to exceed expectations, with each quarter's revenue being about $1.5 billion higher than expected.

The key lies in whether Nvidia can live up to the market's high expectations. As a leader in the semiconductor industry, its performance directly affects the confidence and performance of the entire industry and even the broader market.

Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust, said that Nvidia is not only a benchmark for the chip industry but also the entire artificial intelligence industry. If Nvidia fails to meet expectations, investors may sell all AI companies.

The options market has already booked high volatility, with Nvidia's implied stock price volatility reaching 10%. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the financial report, and Nvidia's market value is close to $3 trillion.

**Expectations Remain High, with Yearly Revenue Doubling**

According to data from the London Stock Exchange as of August 23, it is expected that Nvidia's second-quarter revenue will grow by about 112% year-on-year, reaching $28.68 billion. However, due to increased production costs caused by demand growth, its adjusted gross margin is expected to fall by more than 3 percentage points, from 78.8% in the previous quarter to 75.8%.

However, the market has always expected this AI leader to exceed expectations, not just meet them. Some investors are worried whether Nvidia can meet the high expectations this time.

Analysts expect that Nvidia's financial report will have an important impact on the AI sector on Thursday. If it exceeds Wall Street's expectations, it may further drive the rise of the AI sector; on the contrary, if it falls slightly short, it may impact the stock price.

At the same time, some analysts warn that as the scale expands, Nvidia's growth may slow down.

Nvidia's stock price has soared more than 150% this year, with a market value increase of $1.82 trillion, and has driven the S&P 500 index to a new high. Currently, Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is about 37 times, compared with an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 29 times for the Mag Seven.

**Is the Market Underestimating the Potential Risk?**

Bank of America analyst Gonzalo Asis warned in a recent report that the market may be underpricing the risk of disappointment, and the financial results may bring unexpected fluctuations.

According to Asis, Nvidia's implied stock price volatility is 10%, which means the stock price may fluctuate by 10% in either direction. Since 2018, the stock has never fallen more than 8% on the day of the report.

The volatility index (VIX) on August 5 was 65, highlighting the vulnerability of the broader market's return, and the S&P 500 index is often still vulnerable after such a big impact. Any adverse results from Nvidia's financial report may exacerbate market instability.

Since July, due to market concerns about whether huge AI expenditures can bring corresponding returns, AI industry chain stock prices have experienced a correction. Nvidia's stock price fell by 20% in most of July and early August. Although it has recently rebounded, the stock price is still about 5% lower than the historical high in June.

However, Goldman Sachs is more optimistic about Nvidia's current situation, expecting its Q2 revenue and earnings per share to reach $29.769 billion and $0.68, respectively, which are 4.1% and 5.9% higher than market expectations, and 11% higher than market expectations for earnings per share by 2025.

**Will Blackwell Delay Start Exerting Its Influence?**

The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, said in May that the chip would be shipped in the second quarter. However, analysts later pointed out that design obstacles might delay the shipment time.

Some analysts said that Nvidia could offset most of the impact of the delay of the Blackwell chip by replacing Blackwell chip orders with the previous generation Hopper chip. The functionality and profit of the Hopper series processors are not as good as Blackwell, but they are sufficient for most AI-related applications.

JPMorgan believes that the capacity increase of GB200 will slow down in the second half of 2024, but is expected to expand significantly in 2025. Although there will be production challenges at the beginning, it is expected that the GPU shipments related to Blackwell will still reach more than 4.5 million units in 2025. It is expected that TSMC's revenue will remain relatively stable.

Research firm SemiAnalysis said that if Nvidia's chip contractor TSMC raises fees, this means that Nvidia's revenue growth in the first half of next year may be impacted, and the gross margin may also be squeezed.

LSEG data shows that Nvidia's expected third-quarter revenue will grow by 75% to $31.69 billion, ending its five consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth, while the same period last year was quite strong, with the company's revenue soaring by about 206% to $18.12 billion.",08-27-2024

"Serious question from someone who took a four-year trading breakHey everyone 
After a long long hiatus and licking my wounds I decided to try trading once again. Recently I've been changing up my approach and doing 5-7 DTE spy options. And it's been going pretty decent however recently I got a couple of August 30th calls for Nvidia I managed to get in at a good position for 133 calls.

My thesis is that it's going to keep pumping up to the day of earnings. I don't have any intention of holding the position up until expiration. 

My question is regarding theta decay and volatility. I know that the closer I got to the expiration the less profit I'll see as a percentage of my position. And I also understand that during high levels of volatility it can go both ways. 

And I'm not really asking for specific advice just kind of guidance or knowledge as to how that may affect my position. 
I'm holding them over the weekend and I'm expecting Monday to start off a little red but to finish off green and so I'm not quite sure if I want to sell half my positions and wait till earnings or if I should wait to earnings in general. 

I strongly believe that Nvidia is going to beat their earnings I just don't know how drastically that's going to affect the price action. 

Any and all input is definitely appreciated

"AMD to acquire server builder ZT Systems for $4.9 billion in cash and stockAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced on Monday its plans to acquire server manufacturer ZT Systems for $4.9 billion, as part of its strategy to bolster its portfolio of artificial intelligence (AI) chips and hardware, and to compete more effectively against Nvidia. The acquisition will be financed with 75% cash and the remaining in stock, leveraging AMD’s $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments reported in the second quarter.

The rising demands of AI computing have necessitated the use of thousands of interconnected chips to achieve the required processing power, making the design and construction of server systems increasingly critical. This acquisition will enable AMD to enhance its capabilities in this area. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the addition of ZT Systems’ engineers will accelerate the company’s ability to test and deploy its latest AI GPUs on a scale required by major cloud computing companies like Microsoft.

Although AMD plans to incorporate ZT Systems into its operations, it has no intention of competing directly in the server manufacturing market. Instead, the company plans to divest its server manufacturing business after the acquisition is finalized, with no discussions yet held with potential buyers. ZT Systems CEO Frank Zhang will join AMD, reporting to Forrest Norrod, AMD’s data center chief. The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2025, will see AMD retaining about 1,000 of ZT Systems' roughly 2,500 employees.

"TSMC Sales Surge 45% In July On Strong AI Demand Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported a 45% surge in revenue for July, outpacing its growth from the June quarter and fueling optimism for continued robust demand for artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia Corp.

July sales reached NT$256.95 billion ($7.9 billion). For the third quarter, analysts predict TSMC’s revenue will increase by 37% to NT$747.4 billion, with the July figures indicating TSMC might surpass these expectations.

As Taiwan’s largest company and a key indicator of AI demand, TSMC is the primary chipmaker for leading accelerator manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. It’s also the exclusive supplier of processors for Apple Inc.’s iPhones, as the mobile device market shows signs of rebounding from post-Covid lows. Last month, the world’s largest contract chipmaker raised its full-year growth outlook beyond the previously guided mid-20% range.

TSMC’s American depositary receipts climbed 0.8% to $165.91 at 9:43 a.m. in New York on Friday, while Nvidia shares rose 1% to $105.97.

TSMC delivered a positive outlook during its last earnings report, with CEO C.C. Wei suggesting that the company might increase prices as more customers transition to its advanced technology, competing for limited capacity. High-performance computing, driven by AI, accounted for 52% of TSMC’s revenue last quarter, marking the first time it has contributed more than half.

However, there are growing concerns among investors about whether the massive investments Big Tech firms have poured into AI infrastructure will yield substantial returns. Additionally, a possible delay in Nvidia’s next-generation AI chips has raised questions about the progress of emerging technologies.

TSMC’s 44.7% year-over-year sales surge, the second-highest in the past 20 months, aligns with expectations for a strong Q3. This growth could indicate continued high demand for AI chips and significant 3-nanometer production orders from Apple, Qualcomm, and MediaTek. TSMC appears poised to exceed the upper end of its $23.2 billion Q3 sales guidance.

Concerns over the global economic outlook briefly interrupted the AI-driven rally that had added billions to TSMC’s market value. Investors took profits on some of the year’s top gainers, causing a 10% drop in TSMC’s shares in a single day, although the stock recovered much of that loss as money managers saw a buying opportunity.

"Understand this about INTC...# INTC is a bet. Putting money on INTC pre-dotcom and pre-AI revolution that is.

*What do I mean by this?*

Let me preface this by saying my portfolio is a reverse SMH with Intel on the top. Consistently bought the 30s-33s over the past year. I am currently a bagholder with 10k cost basis (35% of holdings) down 40% as of writing.

Intel is basically a lame duck company. That is how it has been for the past 20 years, and right now. And the bet is that they will no longer be one. There is no other way to logically invest in Intel other than seeing it as a bet.

This is not, or may not even, going to be a growth stock for a while. This is (no longer) a dividend stock. This isn't even a real cyclical, because for that you'd need strong demand cycles, and that demand is met by other companies. Their product lines are not strong enough or they'd be a true competitor in their spaces and we would not be having these discussions. They have been a wealth desert.

*What exactly is Intel's bet?*

**The Intel bet is twofold: 1) The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and 2a) The AI revolution manifesting 2b) Intel catching up in time to grab a significant market share**

**Intel is a bet on America, or a bet on a Miracle. Or both.**

Intel is about as risky as any option going on right now. There is a very real possibility, in stock terms, that you've wasted your money (either literally or through opportunity cost), for the slim chance that you hit it big. **The value of Intel is now the chances that the market sees it achieves either of these bets.**

With this in mind we need to understand the psychology of the Intel investor, as I am one.

*What is an INTC bagholder but a miserable pile of secrets?*

Why do people buy Intel? Well before they wanted to collect dividend like it's MCD or GE or some other boomer stock. The company restructured itself to provide maximum immediate and dividend value to shareholders by gutting innovation and resting on laurels. That was the perception of Intel for the past 20 years.

Now, people buy Intel to participate on the aforementioned bets. The company has signaled it wishes to make this turnaround and so has the US government. If you are in it for any other reason (or you are unfortunate to still be working there, not gutted and it's your 401k which is a minority), you should not touch this stock at all. You need to accept that the money is forfeit. You are not a tech investor. You are making a bet and that makes you a gambler.

TSMC and Samsung are the top dogs because they are safe, and you are betting they won't be. NVIDIA, AMD, Qualcomm and such have taken the lead, and you are betting that there's a spot for Intel. If China relents then that bet is dead, and if AI is dead, then Intel's recovery is moot. Even if AI is not dead, it needs to actually pull off the recovery, and that's where the other bet lies.

*Should I become a bagholder?*

Once you have accepted that this stock carries massive risk and that your money is forfeit, then you can bother owning it.

**Long Intel right now is the closest stock you can get to being an option. Like buying puts/calls, there is no dividend here.**",08-02-2024

"AMZN Earnings Preview- What to watch for tonightEarnings from [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. and Apple Inc. will be crucial in guiding the Nasdaq 100 after a volatile period marked by extreme fluctuations. As the last megacaps to release results before Nvidia Corp. in August, these reports will set the tone for tech investors, particularly focusing on how artificial intelligence is driving growth in Amazon’s cloud-computing unit and boosting demand for Apple's next iPhone. The results will also provide valuable insights into the health of consumer spending, with Amazon shares already up about 25% this year.



[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc. is set to release its Q2 earnings report after the market closes, with a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. ET. Analysts project the company will report revenue of $148.8 billion, marking an 11% increase year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.04, up from 65 cents in the same period last year. Amazon has guided for Q2 operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, signaling strong performance despite broader economic challenges.



Key metrics expected by analysts include AWS revenue at nearly $26 billion, representing more than 17% year-over-year growth, and advertising revenue projected to reach $13 billion, a 21.7% increase from last year. The Stores segment, bolstered by events like Prime Day, is anticipated to show significant activity, while improvements in operating margins, especially in the North America segment, will be closely watched. Analysts also expect updates on AI initiatives and the overall capital expenditures for the year.



Comments from analysts emphasize the importance of AI and cloud services for Amazon's future growth. Citi analysts, led by Ronald Josey, anticipate AWS revenue growth accelerated in Q2 due to generative AI tailwinds, while also predicting a beat in operating income thanks to improved retail efficiencies and strong advertising demand. Truist analyst Youssef Squali highlights Amazon's ability to gain share in global e-commerce and sees multiple growth vectors powering the company's continued expansion.



Retail performance and consumer spending trends will be significant indicators, especially given mixed reports this earnings season. Analysts like Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management note the importance of Amazon's retail margin expansion and its impact on profitability. Additionally, the potential for a surprise dividend announcement is a point of interest, as Amazon remains the last major tech company without a dividend program.



Amazon's Q2 results will follow earnings reports from key competitors like Microsoft and Google, both of which had mixed receptions based on their cloud and AI performances. Wall Street's current focus is on tangible returns from AI investments, making Amazon's updates on its AI initiatives and AWS growth crucial for investor sentiment. The company's dominant position in the cloud market and ongoing efforts to enhance its e-commerce offerings will be under the microscope.



Amazon saw its stock rise following a strong Q1 earnings report, showcasing impressive upside in both EPS and revenue. The standout metric was a significant 221% year-over-year increase in operating income to $15.31 billion, far surpassing the prior guidance of $8-12 billion. The company’s guidance for Q2 operating income of $10-14 billion also exceeded expectations.



The Stores segment performed well, driven by successful shopping events like Amazon's Spring Deal Days in Europe and the first Big Spring Sale in Canada and the US. Faster delivery times, enhanced by regionalization efforts and cost-saving measures such as consolidating units into fewer boxes, boosted customer purchase frequency and overall spend. Additionally, Amazon is preparing for its 10th Prime Day event in July, which is expected to further drive sales.



Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the highlight of the quarter, with a 17% growth in constant currency, an improvement from previous quarters. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue business, with significant growth in both generative and non-generative AI workloads. The Advertising Services segment also showed robust growth, with a 24% increase in revenue to $11.82 billion, driven primarily by sponsored ads and early gains in Prime Video ads. Despite guiding Q2 revenue below consensus due to foreign exchange impacts, the strong performance in AWS and advertising has left investors optimistic.",08-01-2024
"Non competitive investigations - ELI5I have been wondering about this for some time, when the Microsoft-Activision merger happened, then France had an issue with Nvidia, now the US does too.

What I don't understand: why does the government get implicated? If anyone wants to challenge Nvidia, make a better product with a better price and overtake them. How is it fair that nvidia has something 10 or 20 years in the making, like cuda , and now they should share because the others are late to the game?

"[$NVDA] Today’s strong buying activity is driven by two main factors**1. Microsoft’s AI Developments and Capital Expenditure Projections:** 

Unlike Google, Microsoft has already developed significant revenue-generating AI applications, such as CoPilot. Additionally, Microsoft has a unique advantage with its insights into OpenAI, the leading AI company globally, which remains privately held. No other public company has such a perspective.

"Mega-caps vs. small capsThe current state of the stock market exhibits a stark contrast between the performance of mega-cap and small-cap stocks, as investors grapple with mixed signals from major corporations and broader market indices. 

Recent developments have highlighted this divide, with Microsoft's upcoming earnings report set to further shape the narrative.



Mega-Cap Weakness and Market Impact

Microsoft, a key player in the technology sector, is set to report its earnings after the market close, and its performance could significantly influence investor sentiment. 

The recent underperformance of large-cap stocks like Merck and Procter & Gamble, both of which have disappointed with earnings guidance, has contributed to the Nasdaq Composite's (-0.9%) and S&P 500's (-0.4%) downward pressure. 

This weakness is reflected in the Vanguard Mega-Cap Growth ETF (MGK), which is down 1.1%.



Small-Cap Resilience

In contrast, small-cap stocks have shown relative strength, with the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 Value Index posting gains. 

The equal-weighted S&P 500 is also holding its own, indicating that smaller companies are providing a stabilizing force in the market. 

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, buoyed by the financials and energy sectors, adds to this resilience.



Sectors in Focus

The IT sector, weighed down by NVIDIA's (-5.0%) decline ahead of AMD's earnings release, is leading the pack of losers. 

Consumer staples, also negatively impacted, are lagging behind. On the other hand, financials, and energy sectors are posting gains, offering a glimmer of hope for investors seeking opportunities.



Treasuries and Market Sentiment

The Treasury market remains relatively calm, with the 2-yr note yield down to 4.38% and the 10-yr note yield at 4.17%. 

Economic indicators, such as the better-than-expected consumer confidence index and the Bank of Japan's policy decision, have not sparked significant market movements, suggesting that investors are cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's FOMC decision on Wednesday.



As we await Microsoft's earnings report, the stock market's divide between mega-cap and small-cap stocks is a cause for concern, especially for those relying on large-cap performance. 

However, the resilience of small-cap companies and select sectors is providing a silver lining. Investors should stay vigilant, monitor market reactions to key earnings releases, and consider a diversified portfolio that takes into account the current market dynamics. 

The Federal Reserve's decision will likely play a crucial role in determining the market's next course of action.",07-30-2024

"Intel Aims For $1 Billion Software Revenue By 2027, According To CTO Greg LavenderIntel's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Greg Lavender has stated that the company is making smooth progress in the software domain. By the end of 2027, the cumulative revenue from its software business could reach $1 billion.

In 2021, Intel achieved over $100 million in software revenue. It was during this year that CEO Pat Gelsinger brought Lavender from cloud computing company VMware to guide the chipmaker's software strategy. Since then, Intel has acquired three software companies.

I have a goal of getting to $1 billion of software and developer cloud subscription revenue, Lavender said, I think I'm on track to hit this goal by the end of 2027 ... maybe sooner.

Intel generated $54 billion in revenue in 2023, offering a range of software services and tools for rent, from cloud computing to artificial intelligence. Lavender said that his strategy is to focus on providing services in artificial intelligence, performance, and security, and the company has been investing in these three areas.

Additionally, he also stated that Intel has seen lots of demand for its upcoming Gaudi 3 chip, and he believes this can help the company take second place in the AI chip market.

"Nvidia and the Mag 7As much as I love Nvidia, I feel nervous.  Extremely nervous, not only has every analyst raised price target these last few days, Cramer raved about it last night along with Apple.  The math is what has started to freak me out, with such a high multiple.  Revenue growth is where I am struggling. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and google are about 40 percent of the revenue.  Revenue estimates are between 150 and 200 billion this year.  I dont see how that can grow much more without Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon crushing their own profit.  Capex goes right to the bottom line, so wouldn't those stocks go down if capex spending was greater than profit?  Then drag whole market lower?

  
Am I over thinking?  Plus I hate when everyone loves a stock, who is left to jump on board?",07-10-2024

"How would you invest 100k$?Hi guys goodmorning you all,  
I'm not a professional investor or trader, I've just studied something and had a look on reddit in order to learn something.  
But now I want also your suggestion about how would you invest 100k$ if I've to start today from 0.  
I've alreadt few thousands invested in NVIDIA, GOOG etc.  
I would like to buy mainly some ETFs and maybe some single stock.

As I want to do a 5 years investment I know I should not watch at the current price but if there's any suggestion about when and how to buy a ETF? 

I'm really curious about your suggestion.

"Nvidia  More Room to Run: Just Getting StartedA lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. 

AI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.

Yes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.

Every time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.

That’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.

Plus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.

Overall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",07-01-2024
"Amazon Hits $2 Trillion Market Value For First Time as AI Frenzy Fuels RallyAmazon.com Inc. has reached a $2 trillion market valuation for the first time ever as an artificial intelligence-fueled rally pushed the tech giant deeper into record territory. 

Shares rose as much as 3.6% Wednesday to $193.04, pushing the market value to more than $2 trillion. The company is now a member of an elite club of a handful of peers that have surpassed the key market capitalization. Alphabet Inc. passed the $2 trillion threshold in late April, while rallies have pushed market values of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to more than $3 trillion. ",06-26-2024

"Has the market topped already?The recent performance of the U.S. stock market highlights significant market breadth issues, with a notable divergence between the performance of a few large-cap stocks, dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven,"" and the broader market. These seven stocks, which include tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, have driven much of the market’s gains, with Apple rising 8%, Nvidia up 9%, and Microsoft increasing by 4% last week alone.
Percentage of Nasdaq stocks trading above the 50-day MA:


This concentration of gains has led the S&P 500 up by 1.50%, despite the Equal Weight S&P 500 index, which better represents the average stock, falling by 0.50%. This divergence indicates that while the index appears strong, the underlying market health is weaker.

Liz Ann Sonders, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, pointed out that beneath the surface, the average stock in the Nasdaq has experienced a 37% drawdown, compared to the 7% maximum drawdown of the index from its year-to-date high. This suggests significant churn and rotation not visible when solely looking at index level changes.

Further, the share of S&P 500 members trading above their 50-day moving average has dropped below 50%, while the index itself continues to trade above its intermediate-term average by more than 4%. Such divergences, last seen in December 1999 before the tech bubble burst, indicate potential market instability.",06-23-2024
"Bond ETFs: Worth or not? Are you taking a shot at them?The closer we get to the expected lowering of interest rates, the more I'm looking into purchasing Bond UCITS ETFs ***(I live in the UK, meaning we can't buy the usual US ETFs like BND due to regulations)***. A lot of fund managers have mentioned that this is once-in-a-generation opportunity to buy bonds and I tend to agree. Obviously, they have some vested interest in it, but the bullish case is clear.

1. If interest rates drop, then bonds prices will go up as yield and price move in opposite directions. Therefore, if the Fed and the BOE lower interest rates as expected in August/September, the logical conclusion is for those Bond UCITS to go up in price. (We saw the ECB, Bank of Canada and the Swiss Bank lower rates, but I'm guessing these didn't have as much weight as the Fed or they were simply tentative/not convincing enough).
2. If interest rates do not drop, then at least you'll keep getting a relatively good (historically for the last 15 years) yield on your bonds, therefore making some decent passive income.

Obviously, interest rates can also go up, but I think by this point, the chances are pretty much non-existent for that scenario even though it was being mentioned a lot a few months ago.

Now, the next question here is:

1. Which Bond UCITS are the best to get? Ones like iShares Global Aggregate Bond Market (£AGGG) or something riskier like Emerging Markets Bonds (£SEMB)? Here, my expectation is that AGGG would be safer, but returns could be higher with the likes of SEMB.
2. What would the expected price gain be like? Would it be 5%/10%/20% bearing in mind that rates are NOT expected to go back down to 0.5% like before, but somewhere in the range of 2.5%-3%?
3. Is the opportunity cost of not going into equities worth it, e.g. would equities stand a better chance of a gain in the same scenario? Personally, it ***feels*** like the US market is on the edge of a precipice given the price movement so far this year of companies like Nvidia. I'm getting a bubbly feeling and it seems like bonds are now a much more attractive alternative than they were 6 months ago.

Schroders made an interesting article about that - [https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/](https://www.schroders.com/en/global/individual/insights/how-do-stocks-bonds-and-cash-perform-when-the-fed-starts-cutting-rates-/) - and from the look of it, equities tend to outperform bonds in most scenarios UNLESS there is a recession in which case bond investors tend to do a bit better. However, most of the times we've seen rate cuts, there's also been a recession (again, check the Schroders article). I've also seen that cutting rates usually ends up being a bearish indicator for the stock market although, again, that probably depends on whether there's going to be a recession.

I personally haven't ventured into them yet. Looking at [the price of AGGG](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/291773/ishares-core-global-aggregate-bond-ucits-etf), it looks like there's still a good buying opportunity. However, the fund's returns so far have not been stellar (worth pointing out that it was started in 2019 so the returns are only showing returns in near-zero interest rate) and the current yield is just under 3% which is not that great at all. On the other hand, [SEMB has had much better returns](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251824/ishares-jp-morgan-emerging-markets-bond-ucits-etf#/) and a higher yield of 6.18% which makes it more appealing, but it seems much riskier given its biggest exposure is to countries like Turkey, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, etc.

What do you think of this? Are you getting some bonds or not? If so, which UCITS/ETFs do you prefer?",06-23-2024
"My 5 Year plan (any advice?)Im currently 23 years old, I do plan on obtaining real estate around the time I am 27-28 or hopefully sooner and wanted some advice on the path I’m achieving to obtain these goals. 

I currently have a Roth IRA account and a Charles Schwab account set up with some initial investments put into play. 

My plan is to invest in FXAIX within my Roth IRA just to have my long term portfolio set up and set some investments such as VOO, NVIDIA, APPLE, COSTCO, VISA (maybe Microsoft but I know a lot of these are overlapping with VOO) within my Charles Schwab account. Up until I’m ready to cash out and get some property preferably a multi housing unit using a FHA loan. Also hopefully won’t have to pull out all my investments if I reach that 3% down payment requirement. I  also do plan on learning how to swing trade to try and expedite the process. 

Right now I am currently in the process with government jobs so once I’m in, my net income will be way higher than what I’m at right now clearly. Another thing is that I try to live below my needs so paying cheaper rent/ no car payments to make the process quicker. Any advice on practically anything would be appreciated based on investment choices any side business ideas etc… that could help me make extra income or if I’m on the right track with my ideas.

"HPE: Undervalued Tech Giant on the Rise!I'm excited to share some incredible updates and insights about Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) that could make it a standout investment opportunity in the tech space.

# Key Growth Points:

1. **Innovative Financial as a Service (IFaaS)**:
   * HPE's IFaaS is experiencing explosive growth, with an annual revenue rate soaring at 39%. This innovative service model is quickly becoming a cornerstone of HPE's strategy, driving substantial recurring revenue.
2. **AI Systems Revenue**:
   * AI is the future, and HPE is at the forefront. Their AI systems revenue has more than doubled from Q1 to Q2, hitting an impressive $900 million. This rapid growth underscores HPE's strong positioning in the AI market.
3. **Massive AI Systems Orders**:
   * The cumulative orders for HPE’s AI systems have reached a staggering $4.6 billion, maintaining a robust double-digit quarterly growth pace. This is a clear indicator of the high demand and trust in HPE’s AI solutions.
4. **Cutting-Edge Liquid Cooling Technology**:
   * HPE holds over 300 patents in the area of direct liquid cooling. This technology is crucial for managing the power demands of accelerated compute silicon designs, making HPE a leader in sustainable and efficient computing solutions.
5. **Strategic Partnership with NVIDIA (NVDA)**:
   * HPE's collaboration with NVIDIA enhances their AI capabilities and product offerings. This partnership further solidifies HPE's position in the high-performance computing and AI markets.
6. **Valuation Compared to Peers**:
   * Despite these impressive metrics, HPE is significantly undervalued. It’s trading at just 8 times revenue, compared to Dell’s 19 times. This discrepancy highlights a potential for substantial upside as the market recognizes HPE's value.

# Why HPE?

HPE is not just another tech company; it's a powerhouse of innovation and growth. Their strategic focus on AI, IFaaS, and advanced cooling technologies is driving significant revenue increases and solidifying their market position. As the tech landscape evolves, HPE is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and deliver outstanding returns to investors.

# Conclusion:

HPE's growth story is compelling and their current undervaluation offers a unique investment opportunity. With a strong trajectory in AI, IFaaS, and liquid cooling technology, HPE is poised to deliver exceptional value. If you’re looking for a tech stock with solid fundamentals and growth potential, HPE should definitely be on your radar.",06-18-2024

"VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves?Hello, 21 year old here

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right?

Nvidia is Still Massively Undervalued After Seeing All Insider Transactions in Recent Months,06-06-2024
"Nvidia's Meteoric Rise: Can It Sustain Unprecedented Growth?Looking at the fastest comp**** quarterly growth rates (CQGR) for S&P 500 companies since 1990, only 5 companies have sustained positive LTM Net Income growth from Nvidia’s current level ($42,598M or $42.60B) over the next 4 quarters. Their CQGR ranged from 5.65% to 10.57%, with a total growth rate of 17.94% to 35.20%.

The consensus for Nvidia's Net Income (GAAP) in 2025 is around $63B and $83B for 2026. Can Nvidia continue this momentum? With no competition in sight, the odds are in favor of Nvidia continuing to beat expectations, even if it's by a narrow margin.

"Feds set stage for antitrust probes of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAIThe Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the world’s largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations.

As part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models.

The three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft.

The deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.

The agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week.

Spokespeople for the DOJ, FTC, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",06-06-2024

"Why NVIDIA Stock Price Goes Up and Will Continue the Trend?Let's not be surprised by why NVIDIA's stock price jumps all the time. Let’s figure out why.

This is the chart of NVIDIA's earnings after its IPO. No words here, but let’s see why.

NVIDIA has a few major phases in its history:

1. Dot-com boom: In the early 2000s, all you needed was a website with a .com domain ending.

2. Gaming boom: Starting in the 2000s, technology entered the mass market, and the gaming industry began growing. It continues to grow today, and to play a high-quality video game, you would need an NVIDIA video card.

3. Cryp* boom: This started in the early 2010s and continues to this day. To mine cryp*, you need an NVIDIA video card.

4. AI boom: This is happening now. Can you imagine AI model training or running without an NVIDIA video card?

5. What’s next? I think the next big wave is biotechnology.

What do you think, what is the next step?",06-04-2024
"Nvidia's Unprecedented 875% Growth: A Metric Bulls and Bears Must SeeWhether you’re bullish or bearish on Nvidia, there’s one metric you need to consider before making your next move. Historical data since 1990 shows no current S&P 500 company has achieved what Nvidia just did: 

growing its Last Twelve Months (LTM) Net Income from $4 billion to $42.6 billion in just six quarters. The closest comparison is Ford’s growth from $4.5 billion to $23.1 billion over the same 6-quarters duration from 1996 to 1998.

Nvidia’s (CQGR) over the past six quarters stands at an astounding 57.70%, translating to a total growth rate of 875.23%. 57.70% is quarterly rate, not the more common (CAGR).

While some might label this explosive growth as a market top or even fraudulent, others see it as the dawn of an extraordinary growth phase that could continue indefinitely. Whatever your stance, keep in mind that Nvidia’s recent performance represents a once-in-a-century phenomenon.",06-03-2024

"Is it too late for me to invest now?I (M38) am just about to start investing. Am I too late to build up enough money to buy a house and retire in peace?
My youth was spent living paycheck to paycheck and maxing out 5 different credit cards.
I currently intend to pay off everything slowly and simultaneously invest in ETFs.
I've only learnt about equity investing in the past few months and regret not knowing about it since my 20s.

"5/22 Daily Update: $NVDA, $WBD Partners with $DIS, $AMZN AlexaGM folks, here’s what's cooking today

All eyes on **$NVDA.**

**$NVDA** announced a 10-for-one stock split and is upping its quarterly cash dividend by a casual 150%.

$NVDA is now flaunting a market cap above $2.5 TRILLION for the first time ever. Nvidia is now bigger than the entire German stock market. It’s also larger than the combined market cap of the Italian and Australian stock markets. 

Warner Bros. Discovery **$WBD** and Disney **$DIS** have decided to buddy up for College Football Playoff games. They’ve signed a 5-year deal where WBD’s TNT will air two first-round games starting this year, and by 2026, they’ll add a couple of quarterfinal games to the mix.

Amazon planning to roll out an upgraded version of its decade-old voice assistant, Alexa. The cool thing is that they'll be charging a monthly fee for it. Because who doesn’t love paying more for something they’ve been using for free

"NVIDIA ETFs to Watch before Earnings With NVIDIA reporting earnings today, ETFs with the biggest allocations to the company may be a good play. Here's a quick list: 

* Grizzle Growth ETF (DARP), 
* Strive U.S. Semiconductor ETF (SHOC), 
* VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH), 
* Invesco PHLX Semicoductor ETF (SOXQ)
* TrueShares Technology, AI and Deep Learning ETF (LRNZ)

Here's a link to a Yahoo Finance article about it: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-etfs-buy-ahead-q1-161500070.html)

I've been looking these ETFs ex. DARP - NVIDIA is their top position at 19.4% of assets. They also have exposure to the underlying commodities that are in the chips, following the ""Energy Transition"" growth theme we've seen companies move to over the past couple of years. 

NVIDIA's earnings today are going to be important to the market, I think a lot of people will decide to buy in and believe the macro cycle for AI will continue if they beat earnings. If not there will probably be a pullback on the tech side but I think NVIDIA will beat, based on their rapid buildout of infrastructure so far. Ex. As data center demand continues to rise, their revenue generation q-o-q will continue to grow.
