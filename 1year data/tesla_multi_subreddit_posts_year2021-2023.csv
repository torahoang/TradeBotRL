"Does anyone have some thoughts on graphite mining? Could use some extra insights into it! My father in law just recently purchased a 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning and traded in his old F-150 to get it. He literally loved that thing so much so I was actually shocked that he got rid of it and for an electric version of it too… He said he wanted to do his “part” in trying to be energy efficient but didn’t want to give up being a truck owner. He was showing me how and where he charges it (I had to listen to his ramble unfortunately) He was telling me all about the battery that it uses and what it’s made out of etc. It really got me thinking tbh like if him of all people are buying electric cars/trucks then the boom of electric cars has to be coming soon… I felt like I was a little late on the Tesla train so I thought maybe I could get in on the tech side so I decided on looking into the batteries that the man was raving about LOL.

Turns out they’re made out of graphite so my search for a graphite company started lol. I couldn’t find much when looking in the US on graphite mining. I did find Graphite One who operate a graphite mine out in Alaska. Their mission is to make a graphite supply chain that isn’t reliant on any other country and is 100% made in the US. I did some digging (figuratively not literally lol) and found that they had just produced samples not more than a couple weeks ago which I thought was perfect timing haha. Seems like they produced a sample for a fast-charging artificial graphite anode material sample, which is super important for fast-charge performance in EVs (my father in law I’m sure would love to know about that lol). It seems like these results were promising but I’m no graphite expert so if I link the results down low could someone decipher them for me LOL?

I really like the looks of Graphite One mainly because of what they’re trying to do but also because I think the demand of electric cars is going to skyrocket in the coming years. If they manage to pull this off and end up supplying most of the graphite in the US they could be huge. Would love hear some other opinions on them and maybe even graphite and the US in general. How are we feeling about the future of electric cars?? Have a good one everyone!

. 

These are the results I could use help deciphering lool: [https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/graphite-one-receives-first-active-183800837.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/graphite-one-receives-first-active-183800837.html)",05-11-2023
"$DFLI PR. Dragonfly Energy Exploits Significant Revenue Generating Niche In Lithium-Ion Energy Markets 

The EV sector is here to stay. More accurately, its staggering growth is the precursor to much more to come. With that comes investment opportunities. And a significant one is in play for those looking beyond the surging demand in the general vehicle space. In other words, finding companies working to *NOT* directly compete with Tesla

**TSLA-3.24%+**, Ford **F-2.79%+**, General Motors **GM-2.32%+**, and a growing number of smaller manufacturers, could be the right way to allocate investment dollars. Focused on developing and selling its lithium-ion energy sources to significant markets outside of those behemoth's interests, Dragonfly Energy **DFLI+4.10%+** makes that list.

And they are not newcomers trying to find footing. They already have it. Dragonfly is over a decade old, initially founded as a developer of intellectual property focused on Lithium-ion cell manufacturing. They've grown considerably since, revolutionizing the industry by making lithium-ion batteries more accessible for RVers while facilitating an entirely off-grid experience for RV consumers. That differentiation continues to pay growth dividends, with DFLI consistently increasing its market share and sales within the RV, marine, and off-grid solar sectors. Sales in 2022 reached $86 million. More than a sizable total for a smallcap, it represented its fifth consecutive year of revenue growth, an impressive stat since DFLI only started shipping products in 2017.

That streak is expected to continue; DFLI even guided that way. And as a more comprehensive lithium-ion battery technology company today than ever, growth is likely well beyond the forecast period. Considering that operations expanded to developing cell manufacturing processes, designing and assembling battery packs, integrating these packs and other innovative ancillary components into complete energy storage systems, and marketing and sales of these systems into diverse consumer and industrial market channels, it's more than likely; it's probable.

**Better Energy Sources Disrupt Traditional Markets**

Disruptive technology tends to have that effect, and Dragonfly has it, changing the traditional approach of powering RV, marine, and off-grid markets that have relied on lead-acid batteries. Remember, lead is toxic and remains a significant problem for the environment. As a result, demonstrated by its revenue growth, the target markets have been quite receptive to Dragonfly's technology. They should be. It supports a global effort and mission to convert to green, renewable energy. Moreover, unlike competing lead-acid alternatives, Dragonfly and Battle Born batteries are environmentally safer, provide 2-3 times more power, last over ten times longer, are one-fifth the weight, charge faster and require no maintenance. That's game-changing.

To get them into customers' hands, DFLI sells its deep-cycle lithium-ion batteries under two brands. The first is its Dragonfly Energy brand, which serves its Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) customers and partners, including the industry-leading THOR family of recreational vehicles. The second is its direct-to-consumer retail brand, 'Battle Born Batteries,' named after the battle-born state of Nevada, where Dragonfly is headquartered. Beyond the revenue contributions from its branded batteries, income is generated from being designers and resellers of accessories, a defining factor making DFLI a total system integrator for its customers, a value strengthened after acquiring Wakespeed Offshore in 2022.

That deal facilitated Dragonfly to better integrate its storage systems with vehicle engines and alternators. Combined with battery pack monitoring and communication innovations, it sets the 2023 stage for DFLI to capitalize on opportunities presented by larger stationary storage applications. They've earned that position.

Today, Dragonfly is recognized as an expert in lithium-ion batteries and entire lithium battery storage systems. That results from having a robust patent portfolio continually strengthened by innovation, including Dragonfly's dry powder coating cell manufacturing technology and non-flammable battery technology. Production of the cell pilot line for that technology is in progress, with plans to monetize cell manufacturing in the United States next year.

**Stage Set For 2H/2023 Growth**

All told, revenue contributions from its segments are expected to deliver significant YoY growth. The guidance calls for Q1/2023 revenue to range between $17.0 - $19.0 million. Lower overhead is expected to increase margins, though not appreciably. However, revenues and margin curves are expected to steepen as the year goes on, benefiting from the market strength inherent to its OEM business. That's led to DFLI, despite challenging but moderating headwinds, to forecast net sales between $112 to $122 million, or 36% year-over-year growth at the mid-point of the range.

Most important, and the reason for investors to pay attention to the DFLI value proposition at current levels, is that DFLI expects to return to being net income positive in the second half of the year. Thus, recent share price weakness exposes a disconnect between value and expectations. Knowing that savvy traders invest with a forward-looking perspective, it's a window that could close sooner than later. And by ending last year with $17.8 million in cash and access to a $150 million equity line of credit, providing reasons that justify closing that gap may very well be in the news queue. Trading ahead of that likelihood may therefore be a wise and timely consideration.

"Crutiss Motorcycles ($CMOT) - Curtiss Motorcycles With A New Luxury Electric Bike$CMOT

**Introduction**

I've never really been a bike guy in the past, but recently my uncle got a new motorcycle and it got me thinking about the world of bikes. I've always heard about the tough Harley Davidson guys that have all the flames across them, but I always thought what about electric versions? Is there an explosive or cruising version that could be electric and still have that gritty feeling of a bike? In the depths of the research, I found Curtiss Motorcycles who seems to have fulfilled that niche.

https://preview.redd.it/f12jpnlmcl0a1.png?width=179&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd52303784cce07a69e020ce44209737202007c8

**Who They Are**

Curtiss is a luxury motorcycle company that is creating an electric bike for that new version of the glory days of motorcycles. I honestly haven't found any other companies that have the same level of detail. Most other bike companies have premium or less quality, while Curtiss has the highest level of luxury that demands exclusivity.

**Product**

The 1(Work of Art Edition) - Currently the only model they have created. It has a battery that would need changing roughly every 7 to 10 years. The entire rest of the bike would last a lifetime given fair maintenance. The bike is able to be charged at home for you convenience, making it very easy as an everyday driver. Production is said to be happening next year and for orders to be going out as well.

It looks very futuristic and a great upgrade for the world of motorcycles. The bike is also fully customizable in terms of colour coding. You can make any colour scheme and make your bike pop and stand out on the road. Making your ride truly a 1 of 1.

**Macro Trends**

Everyone knows the wonder of the EV market. Tesla is leading the way in cars and potentially the truck with their new edition. Curtiss is looking to lead the market in the bike category. As the world of fossil fuels are being reduced, electric vehicles are becoming cheaper and more accessible for all. Not only would an electric bike be much cheaper on a daily driving basis with the cost of fuel reduced, but also is a lot cleaner and quieter so you can driving knowing your not annoying others.

**Final Thoughts**

I'm not personally in the position to purchase a new vehicle, but for those who are looking for a luxurious new bike Curtiss looks like the one to have. It has great long-term prospects being very cheap to maintain with only the battery needing replacement. The electric aspect is the new trend that doesn't have any showing of slowing down. The 1 by Curtiss Motorcycles is changing the motorcycle industry for the better.

"Quantum Computing To Revolutionize Cyber SecurityIn light of the opportunities and threats presented by quantum computing, many tech companies have taken initiatives in the recent past to develop cybersecurity solutions that address the threats posed by quantum computing while using the same technologies to foolproof their product offering. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one such tech giant at the forefront of this movement. The company, in recent quarters, has highlighted the importance of developing post-quantum cryptography to build encryption systems that cannot be deciphered easily with quantum computing. The company recently launched the NIST Post-Quantum Project, inviting cryptographers worldwide to submit candidates for peer review. Microsoft is currently experimenting with four post-quantum project candidates: FrodoKEM, SIKE, Picnic, and qTESLA. With its deep pockets, Microsoft is well-positioned to spend millions of dollars in R&D investments to build cybersecurity solutions that alleviate the threat posed by quantum computing.

Hub Cyber Security (TASE:HUB) is another company to look out for in the cybersecurity space. The company’s confidential computing solutions are some of the only “quantum-ready” solutions. HUB is already partnering with QuantLR to develop a quantum security solution for the Israeli Ministry of Defense and other high-end customers such as government entities and multinational organizations. This year, the company has agreed to merge with SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition Corp. (RNER) and is already collaborating with private and government entities in Israel and other key markets to deploy cybersecurity solutions that address the threat quantum computing poses.

The rise of quantum computing offers opportunities and challenges for the cybersecurity industry. As a result of this, the industry is changing dynamically today. Both established and young companies are developing solutions to protect sensitive data from the risks posed by quantum computing while making the most of this advanced technology. These companies are likely to gain lucrative financial rewards in the long run.

"Sector Rotation And 9 Stocks To Watch During A RecessionIs the United States heading toward a recession?

This has been the looming question on the minds of Americans since inflation topped at 8.5% in March, matched with other indicators such as rising interest rates and the bond market’s inverted yield curve.

Top economists are split on the inevitability of a recession. Former **Goldman Sachs Group Inc** CEO **Lloyd Blankfein** said over the weekend, “It’s certainly a very, very high-risk factor,” but believes that the Fed is responding well to the risk.

**Moody’s Corporation**  chief economist **Mark Zandi** predicted a 35% probability that America will enter a recession in the next two years. **Twitter Inc.'s**  most-loved **Elon Musk** predicted a recession as early as the summer of 2022.

**Conflicting outlooks aside, it is essential to look at the facts and what has historically preceded a recession.**

The yield curve inverted on March 29 for the first time since 2019. This occurs when the short-term U.S. treasury is paying a higher interest rate than long-term U.S. treasuries. More than that, Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** indicated a 50 basis point increase, up from the traditional 0.25% at the last FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.

**The known definition of a recession is a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters.** According to the Bureau of Economic analysis, the GDP decreased at an annual rate of 1.4%, down from 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

**While the macro outlook is pessimistic at best, it is critical to understand the broader market trends that indicate where money moves, such as the economic cycle and sector rotation.**

It is known that a recession is a natural part of a growing economy and as part of the economic cycle. The cycle can be simply defined as when the economy moves from a growth stage to a recession and back to growth. This is probably the most influential force on the broader markets because it directly relates to stock prices vis-a-vis company profits.

The stock market's relationship with the economic cycle lies in the various sectors that make up the markets, which are sensitive to different stages of the cycle.

**Are you confused yet? This should make it easy.**

Some sectors will outperform when the economy is growing (Industrials, Consumer names, Real Estate) and others when the economy is in a recession (Healthcare, Food, Consumer Staples, Utilities)

**This is known as sector rotation or the way investors move money during the various stages of the economic cycle.**

When the economy moves toward a recession, investors usually rotate into sectors that are less sensitive to the economic cycle, such as Consumer Staples and Utilities; these are known as **defensive sectors** because they can offer a relative level of protection during an economic downturn.

Some of those defensive names include:

**Coca-Cola Co** **KO**  
**Albertsons Companies Inc**   
**Altria Group Inc**   
**NRG Energy Inc**   
**PG&E Corporation**   
**Clearway Energy Inc**   
**National HealthCare Corporation**   
**HealthStream, Inc.**   
**Regencell Bioscience Holdings Ltd** 

On the opposite end, when emerging from a recession, investors rotate into highly sensitive names to the cycle, such as **Industrials and Consumer** **cyclicals.**

Some of those names include:

**Caterpillar Inc** 

**CAT**  
**Johnson & Johnson**   
**Ecolab Inc**   
**Chevron Corp.**   
**Tesla Inc**   
**JPMorgan Chase & Co.**

"Undervalued Plant-Based Stock PlaysA great investment philosophy is simple. Invest today into tomorrow’s future. Applied to the food world, this philosophy has one straightforward takeaway: buy vegan and plant based stocks. Plant-based food is the future of eating and over the next decade, the enormous legacy animal-based foods industry is going to be entirely disrupted by emerging plant-based foods companies that are winning over the hearts (and wallets) of young consumers (who, for what it's worth, are becoming the driving force of the global consumer economy).And this trend goes beyond mere investment philosophy; according to Statista, revenue in the e-commerce market is expected to reach $4.15 trillion in 2022 and rise to $5.73 trillion in 2025. This equals a growth CAGR of 11.35% between 2022 to 2025. 

In other words, it’s time to buy vegan stocks…

The first entry on this list of vegan stocks to buy is the most well known vegan stock of them all: Beyond Meat (BYND). The plant-based meat maker is for all intents and purposes the face of the vegan revolution. The company’s meatless burgers, sausages, and other meat products are served fresh. Beyond Meat accomplishes this through various fast food chains like Blaze Pizza, Burger King, Carl’s Jr., and Del Taco. Moreso packaged through various grocery stores. Beyond Meat will be able to leverage its first-mover’s advantage, strong brand equity,  awareness, advanced faux meat construction process, robust production capabilities, widespread fast-food, and grocery store distribution to sustain leadership in the vegan meat market over the next several years. Indeed, Beyond Meat is seen as the Tesla of vegan meat.

The second on the list and in my eyes the most promising vegan stock at the moment is PlantX ([VEGA.CN](https://VEGA.CN) and VEGA.C). PlantX is fast making a name for itself as the Amazon of the plant-based/health food/vegan community by leveraging a tech-centric approach to capitalize on the massive growth potential of the industry as a whole. As the digital face of the plant-based community, PlantX's platform is the one-stop shop for everything plant-based. The company currently offers over 5,000 vegan products on its ecommerce catalog, as well as meal and indoor plant delivery services.

PlantX continues to report robust month-over-month and year-over-year revenue increases, as shown by previous financial results. For the month of March 2022, the Company generated gross revenue of $1,719,577, reflecting a 28% increase from February 2022, and 168% increase, net of wholesale revenue, compared to the month of March 2021. Following this strong performance up the next month, PlantX recently announced April 2022 revenue growth that are likewise impressive. Last month the company generated monthly gross revenue of $ 1,744,248, representing a 168% increase from April 2021.

The Company’s ongoing financial progress has been consistent with management’s efforts to invest in strategic partnerships to accelerate expansion efficiently and proactively. Beyond the growth that PlantX is experiencing, the Company has been heavily investing in maximizing the quality of its current services and programs to better serve its growing customer base.  This growth clearly indicate PlantX’s potential for consistent growth. As PlantX continues to focus on business to consumer efforts, they are seeing increases in margins while establishing a loyal customer base. Their focus is on investing in quality, innovation, and strategic partnerships, which is clearly a rewarding strategy for PlantX. 

To grow its customer base, the company has formed partnerships with celebrity chefs and well-known vegan brands. PlantX is leveraging the growing e-commerce market to offer high-quality items to the plant-based community. Its products can be found on [thebay.com](https://thebay.com), [amazon.com](https://amazon.com), [walmart.com](https://walmart.com), and [walmart.ca](https://walmart.ca). The company is becoming a go-to plant-based brand with a growing customer base and as it expands its online presence, there will be more lucrative opportunities in the future. PlantX stock currently seems undervalued, which seems to be THE perfect time to invest in the company to gain exposure to the plant-based market.

"Show r/StocksAndTrading: Explore correlations between stocks.I built a website that lets you explore correlations between stocks. I built it for myself because I wanted to find stocks that are inversely correlated with Tesla's stock. Maybe the website has value for some of you.

It shows you the 10 most strongly and inversely correlated values of every stock in the database.

I see 3 applications for correlations in regards to investing:

   * Reduce the risk of a portfolio and ensure that assets are not overly correlated.
   * Find an alternative to hard-to-trade assets. For example, it is difficult for a retail investor to trade oil. Therefore, it may make sense to look for investments that strongly correlate with the oil price.
   * To bet against the price of a stock with an inversely correlated stock. If you think a certain stock is overvalued, you can search for stocks with inverse correlations. You can then invest in them, thus creating an implicit short position. This method is much less risky than typical methods such as shorts and put options.

"WHY TESLA COULD BE LARGER THAN GM & FORD COMBINED BY 2027 

#### Key points:

* Morgan Stanley expects Tesla revenue to outshine GM and Ford quicker than you might think
* Tesla recorded year-on-year growth of 63%, whilst the broader market dropped 10%
* Tesla appears well-posiitoned with share donors

Tesla dominates the EV market; we already know that. As companies turn towards the emerging market trend with hopes of securing a slice of the market share; competition is incredibly rife…or is it? How much does Tesla’s position outweigh the possibilities and approaches of burgeoning EV makers? Not just that, but how much are long-standing automobile favorites like GM and Ford under mounting pressure?

In a recent note from Morgan Stanley, the firm expects Tesla revenues to be larger than GM and Ford combined in the next five years. Tesla is outperforming the market, and that’s where the long-term outlook derives from. 

Tesla's U.S market share was 4% on year-on-year growth of 63%, whilst the broader market volume was down 10% – Morgan Stanley expects the full-year market share to stand at around 3.5%. Also, the average Tesla sold commands a price of $60,000, 30% above the US average price, implying, as Morgan Stanley points out, an adjusted ‘wallet share’ of 4.6%.

The firm estimate that Tesla's share of US wallet should reach 10% by 2025 and 13% by 2030. The firm also believes that Tesla is well-positioned with share donors, as movement in a low-growth auto market normally points to a group of share donors.

So, looking at GM, the company’s market share is expected to drop from 14.6% (2021) to 14% by 2025 and less than 12% by 2030. Similarly, Ford’s market share is expected to drop from 12.5% (2021) to just over 10% by 2030. With this information, Morgan Stanley expects Tesla’s revenue share to surpass GM by late 2026/2027.",02-03-2022
"THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD SHORT LUCID GROUP STOCK (LCID) IN FEBRUARY 

#### Key points:

* Lucid stock is down 30% since the start of the year
* With little fundamental developments, are investors hung-up on ambitious projections?
* Growth stocks are likely to remain under pressure by continued market headwinds

The last two years have seriously outlined the reality of EV speculation. Slippery SPAC mergers have revealed fraud allegations, retail traders have overhyped public trading debut’s, and still, Tesla dominates EV market share. The [Chinese market has proved a critical landscape for sales](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/the-chinese-ev-boom-is-proving-critical-for-overall-tesla-sales/) as the country continues its decarbonization journey one step ahead of the U.S, and [EV charging companies are slowly depreciating](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/heres-why-blink-chargings-new-partnership-isnt-exactly-inspiring/) as demand isn’t quite where it needs to be. 

All in all, it’s been an exciting time for the emerging market, but I can’t help wondering how far down the line will we see profitability from the fresh faces on the scene. After all, it should take a little more than ambitious projections to win the bids of investors; especially when the company has next to no data to prove it.

Lucid Group – a promising EV manufacturer that does have potential, but in my opinion, not in the short term. Running through some overall technicals, Lucid is still up 168% since its merger in 2020, after reaching prominent heights late last year the stock has continued to drop; now sitting 35% down since the start of the year. 

So not a great start to 2022, and there are numerous reasons for this. Unfortunately for the company, due to a hawkish monetary policy, investors are rotating out of high-growth tech stocks amidst rising interest rates and inflationary worries – spurring a wide sell-off across the board. 

We would love to see this as nothing but a temporary hurdle; but with the fed expected to increase rates multiple times throughout the year, uncertainty is wreaking havoc in the markets with sentiment wavering on a bearish outlook. 

Yet this certainly isn’t the key reason you should be looking to short Lucid. We haven’t really seen much fundamental change in Lucid’s pragmatism; just rose-tinted projections met with hollow deadlines. The Lucid Air, which was expected to reach the market in Spring 2021, still hasn’t gone further than, well… anywhere really. Sure, [reservations are apparently increasing,](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/lucid-group-stock-rallies-9-after-increasing-vehicle-reservations/) but the company still has nothing to show for itself apart from consistent delays, as well as cutting back 2021’’s delivery targets from 6,000 to a mere 520. 

A further red flag late last year, Lucid issued a convertible note offering in a [$1.75B debt financing agreement](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/lucid-group-stock-falls-10-following-1-75b-debt-financing-decision/). This is by no means shocking when it comes to new company’s, and although it can result in stock dilution further down the line, generally isn’t a problem. In the case of Lucid, stock dropped 10% following the agreement, alluding to the fact that investors were clearly worried about the company’s financial stability amidst its bold projections with little actual backing.

The only place where Lucid seems to be gaining fundamental traction is the Middle East. January 19th marked the lockup expiration for Lucid; meaning shareholders are able to sell off unwanted stock. Whilst this normally provokes a sharp downside in the market, Lucid stock is being held up by The Saudi Public Investment Fund, which holds a 62.7% stake in Lucid and held its stake following the lockup expiration. It seems that Lucid does hold a strong position in Saudi’s transformation efforts; with Lucid in advanced talks to establish manufacturing units. 

Once again, projections, expectations, and rumors have been the sole catalyst for Lucid’s sustainability, but I’m not convinced this will last long, unless we see actual production targets being met, and unless Lucid has the capability to deliver on their well-polished outlook. Although the financial outlook is an important crux of an investment decision; when it comes to Lucid Group, that is all they seem to have. Further market headwinds could increase with the looming conflict in Ukraine, but that isn’t for certain. 

Lucid Group has the potential to capitalize on a portion of market share should they start meeting their targets and continue to impress in the Middle East. In the meantime, however, based on the company’s position, financial stability, and other market headwinds, I can’t see Lucid stock finding much support, especially in the next month or so. ",01-29-2022

"Tesla Snubs Cybertruck In 2022Shares of Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) dipped 0.80% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the electric vehicle company posted positive earnings mixed with supply chain woes.

Financials: Tesla reported earnings per share of $2.52 and revenue of $17.7 billion; both were better than expected.

Trouble: While the financials looked good for Tesla, including an impressive 29.2% ex-credits automotive gross margin, many investors wanted more from the company. Tesla also said that it experienced challenges related to supply chain, labor, and manufacturing.

Priorities: CEO Elon Musk said during the earnings call on Wednesday that the chip shortage has resulted in the company prioritizing deliveries of current vehicles this year instead of developing new vehicles. That means the company will not roll out its highly-publicized new Cybertruck in 2022.

Final Thoughts: How will Tesla balance demand and supply chain issues in 2022? The company is a giant in the electric vehicle space, but the valuation of the stock is still too high for some investors.

"YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO TAKE TESLA’S ‘IMPRESSIVE DELIVERIES’ FOR FACE VALUE 

* Tesla' ‘Blockbuster Q4 deliveries' doesn't quite tell the whole story
* Due to safety issues, nearly half a million models were recalled
* Tesla is up 10% and approaches 2021 high's as investors latch on to Q4 positivity

Overall, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) had another stellar year. Sure, there were a few bumps in the road – Musk’s twitter-sparked stock sell-off led to sizeable retracement; but nothing that the EV market cap giant couldn’t recover from. Tesla has been around for a while now, but more importantly, so has the hype. 

Tesla has earned somewhat of a reputation as the ‘golden child' of the EV family; trustworthy, consistent, and well-known, Tesla has made its way to the top through a perfect blend of top-end engineering, the formidable personality of its CEO, and a general aura of excitement…

In light of recent news, disguised by Tesla’s winning vendetta against the global chip shortage, concerns are arising regarding safety issues in its Model 3 and Model S models. Strangely, investors still appear to be latching on to Tesla’s stand-alone stance when it comes to the chip shortage that has hit EV manufacturers but hasn’t affected the dramatic growth of Tesla sales. 

The crux of it is, Tesla is currently recalling nearly half a million of its vehicles to address these safety issues that apparently, in the words of the U.S road safety regulator, ‘increase the risk of crashing’. Unfortunately for the high-end company, this wasn’t a one-off misdemeanor – the cars affected ranged across model years 2014 to 2021. So looking at the shiny, lucrative exterior of Tesla – it’s easy enough to be enticed, and to be frank, investors would have relished the 50% rise in Tesla stock price from 2020; but a bit of polish won’t always cover the cracks. 

Out of the 936,000 vehicles delivered in 2021, Tesla has had to recall 475,000 – nearly equating to the total amount of deliveries in 2020. This should really raise a few red flags for investors, but yet Tesla stock is currently showing a daily gain of around 9% – are Tesla investors blinded by unconditional trust in Musk? Or are these callbacks nothing more than a minor pothole in the long road to market share domination? Or perhaps it is the company's chip-shortage navigation that puts the company one step ahead. 

Ramping up China production has been huge for the company; [cashing in on government-issued EV subsidies.](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/buyers-flock-to-nio-xpeng-more-to-avoid-2022-subsidy-cuts/) Should safety issues continue to be reoccurring features of Tesla vehicles, we might find inventors opting for other, reliable companies that still offer a low-price entry. However, [Tesla is still very much a force to be reckoned with;](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/hype-aside-these-are-the-3-ev-stocks-you-need-in-your-2022-portfolio/) and buyers will most likely continue to drown out periods of short-lived volatility. Still, the large-scale vehicle callback should act as a wake-up call for many; even the giants have their downfalls. ",01-04-2022

"Tesla's Trunk Flaw Sparks RecallShares of Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) fell 1.46% on Thursday after the electric vehicle maker recalled over 475,000 automobiles due to a pair of potential safety flaws.

Details: The defaults include a cable connected to the rearview camera for the 2017 through 2020 Tesla Model 3s that could be damaged by opening and closing the trunk, as well as latches that were not properly installed on the front trunk for Model S sedans from 2014 or later, according to NPR.

Background: This isn’t the first time that Tesla has faced safety concerns. Regulators are investigating accidents related to its autopilot feature. The company also had to make changes to a video game feature in the car.

Bigger Picture: Recalls are common in the automobile industry. And while this recall is separate from the other issues that Tesla is dealing with, it still calls into question the safety of the company. However, the fundamentals of the company are still the same.

Final Thoughts: Tesla’s stock price is down 2% this month, but up over 46% this year.

"Temas Resources DD(CSE: TMAS) (OTCQB: TMASF) (FSE: 26P)

Temas Resources is a Canadian based mineral exploration company with a very skilled and experienced management team driving the ship. They invest in and apply green technology across its mining portfolio to reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint of metal extraction through advanced processing and patented leaching technologies. Their assets include 50% of ORF Technologies, MetaLeach and the La Blanche and Piskanja projects.

They purchased a 100% interest in the La Blache property in Core-Nord, Quebec from Cloudbreak Discovery in 2020. The La Blache property consists of 176 mineral claims over approximately 9500 hectares. Temas is has a special focus here on extracting titanium dioxide (TiO2), which is used in paints, coatings, plastics, paper, cosmetics, foods and tons of other commercial products. The market for TiO2 is expected to grow at a rate of 8.7% annually from now to 2025, which isn't unreasonable since it is used in so many essential products and daily items.

Temas' 50% ownership in ORF plays into the La Blache property exploration as ORF Technologies holds a vast portfolio of patents in clean mineral extraction. The anticipated mineralization from the La Blanche project in Quebec will be ideal feedstock for the ORF processing and recovery. In fact, it is estimated that ORF's TiO2 recovery process can cut production costs by roughly 70%! This process is also much more environmentally friendly than the conventional methods and is perfectly aligned with ESG policies.

Another very interesting application of ORF technology is to Nickel extraction, which is an essential mineral in EV batteries. Companies, like Tesla, that are committed to green energy and sustainability have been looking around desperately for a supplier of sustainably extracted Nickel. If ORF's Technology pans out this could be a huge catalyst for the stock.

More on ORF: [http://temasresources.com/our-business/orf-technologies/](http://temasresources.com/our-business/orf-technologies/)

Temas also has a exclusive North American & European licensing agreement for the sale of MetaLeach’s processing technologies, including AmmLeach, NickeLeach, HyperLeach and MoReLeach. MetaLeach could also be applied to the clean Nickel extraction I mentioned above. Benefits of MetaLeach:

* Potential operating and capital cost savings of 30-50%
* Enables the treatment of base metals deposits that were not treatable with traditional processing methods
* Reduction in carbon footprint

More on MetaLeach: [http://temasresources.com/our-business/metaleach/](http://temasresources.com/our-business/metaleach/)

They are currently trading at a 52 week low of $0.11 per share with a market cap of 7.79 million. I think this investors are being impatient with this stock and now could be a good time to capitalize. ORF and MetaLeach will help them to maximize efficiency at their projects and should equate to value creation for shareholders.

"Super-Bearish Catalysts of Market Losses!**I've received messages this week from friends of mine who saw their portfolios fall sharply. Others who were on the sidelines with large cash positions saw a number of the world's most promising companies drop by 20%, 30%, and as much as 50% in just a couple of weeks.**  


By looking at the major indices that are heavily influenced by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Netflix, Nvidia, and Tesla, you're not seeing the true scope of the situation.  


**Most retail investors and Wall Street funds don't hold most of their wealth in the S&P 500. They own high-growth stocks, such as the ones that Cathie Wood has in her ETFs.**  


In 2020 and 2021, an entire generation of millennials and Generation Z demographics bought stocks for the first time. AMC, GME, and other meme stocks attracted tens of millions of people to the markets, and fundamentals didn't matter (on the upside). It now seems valuations don’t matter (on the downside).  


**Look at the price drops in these well-loved names:**  


Lemonade (insurance disruptor): -76% since February, currently at an all-time low.  
The Honest Company (founded by actress Jessica Alba): -66% since May, currently at an all-time low.  
DocuSign (dominant e-signature platform): -56% since July, currently dropped 44% in ONE DAY following reports.  
Affirm Holdings (FinTech disruptor): -36% this month.  
Invitae (Cathie Wood darling pick): -73% since February, currently at 3-year lows.  
Teladoc (telehealth disruptor): -68% since February, currently near 3-year lows.  


**All of the major Chinese stocks have been obliterated off the map as well!**  


A year like this proves, beyond any shadow of a doubt, the importance of investing in the indices alongside any stock-picking one does.  


**If you were looking for an opportunity to enter the markets after the insane bubble of 2020, know that the retail mania is dead.**  


It's absolutely true that millennials love stocks as a pastime, but they now understand that 2020 was a fluke and not the norm.  


Buying the dip always feels like a sucker's game when in the middle of a correction, but timing the market is not as important as time in the market.  


**Fundamentally, what's happening in the markets is the notion that in the next year (2022), inflation will still be high, but that the trend is weakening, so 2023 and beyond will be deflationary.**  


Because of this, tech growth stocks that aren't profitable yet are being sold off. Inflation is the enemy of growth since it means that paying for future profits must discount the depreciation in fiat currency.  


**On the flip side, value stocks that distribute a dividend are highly praised.**  


If you're buying disruption stocks, prices now are very cheap, but they might stay like that for a whole year, so be strategic about it.  


**Markets are certain that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in June 2022, and we think that this won't be a surprise. Gold is already pushing forward, and I think we might be nearing an important bottom.**  


If we get one last sell-off, I'll be there buying my favorite mining stocks and going into what I think is going to be a wild 2022 for miners.

One on the top of my list is **Callinex Mines (TSX-V:CNX, OTC:CLLXF)** which have caught the attention of smart-money investors.

&#x200B;

This is a miner with multiple high-conviction properties, including Manitoba’s Flin Flon District with Callinex’s high-grade copper, gold, silver, and zinc-rich Rainbow Deposit that is being rapidly expanded right now.

&#x200B;

Additionally, the company is advancing two near-surface silver discoveries in close proximity to its Nash Creek deposit in the Bathurst Mining District of New Brunswick. A 2018 PEA on its Bathurst Project portfolio outlined a mine plan that generates a strong economic return with a pre-tax IRR of 34.1% and NPV8% of $230 million.

&#x200B;

This is a small miner with huge potential: A $52 million market cap and no debt whatsoever are features that enhance the excellent reward-to-risk profile of Callinex Mines today.

&#x200B;

Clearly, Callinex Mines should be at the top of any resource investors’ watch list – and with inflation set to ramp up much higher, this is a company to ride coming wave of interest in inflation-resistant hard assets.

Elon Musk’s Tesla Share-Selling Spree Tops $10 Billion,12-03-2021
"Elon Musk's SpaceX IPO TweetA tweet on Monday afternoon by Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has investors wondering if an initial public offering could soon happen for SpaceX, Musk’s aerospace company.

Details: Trung Phan, a writer for The Hustle, tweeted in September a copy of a 2013 email that Musk wrote to employees about why he wants to keep SpaceX private. Musk responded on Monday with a tweet that read: “A lot has happened in 8 years.”

Background: Between Tesla and Dogecoin, Musk has the attention of many investors. If SpaceX went public, there would be a lot of investor interest.

Numbers: SpaceX reached a $100 billion valuation after a 2021 secondary share sale, according to CNBC.

Final Thoughts: The speculation regarding SpaceX’s potential IPO won’t stop, no matter what Musk tweets.

Elon Musk’s Tax Bill on Stock Options Fell Along With Tesla’s Share Price,11-24-2021
"Is this a Bubble?Red flags: 

Valuations for EV companies like Rivian, Tesla and others seem far above their true value. Example: how can a company that delivers 0 vehicles have the same marketcap as Ford? How is that not just hype?

Are stock prices inflated by low interest rates? 

Are these public offerings all way overvalued? Stocks like Robinhood and Coinbase seem to be valued far above what they’re worth upon initial IPO.

All the capital seems to be flowing to tech stocks, EVs and AI that haven’t really delivered anything yet. 

Also, is Pelosi driving Roblox up by virtue of having bought so many shares?

This “recovery” of the stock market doesn’t seem in sync with an economy that clearly hasn’t recovered.

Companies like Zillow** no longer buying homes. Dead stop on ibuying. Losing money. 

Meme stocks like GME, AMC, DWAC, I mean come on. I understand what Apes are doing and I think it’s awesome and cool, but how long can this really go on for? I mean really?

"Temas Resources could be a low-cost play on green Nickel extraction (CSE: TMAS)(CSE: TMAS) (OTCQB: TMASF) (FSE: 26P)

Temas Resources is a Canadian based exploration company with an experienced management team and board of directors. They are currently focused on the investment and development of processes that allow for environmentally friendly extraction of minerals. They are currently working on advancing the La Blanche Fe-Ti-V projects in Quebec. The La Blanche project is located 100km north of Baie-Comeau, Quebec and is comprised of 176 claims covering 9466.97 hectares. Management believes there is significant potential within the La Blache Property.

Fe-Ti-V is an acronym for Magnetite (Fe2O3), Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), and Vanadium Pentoxide (V2O5). There are huge markets for each of these materials, with Titanium dioxide being the largest. Current market size for TiO2 is $15.76 billion, expected to grow at almost 9% per year according to Gran View Research. TiO2 pigments are used in paints and coatings, plastics, paper, building materials, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foods and many other commercial products.

Preliminary metallurgical testing of the oxide mineralization yielded 90% recovery of Iron and 95% recovery of Vanadium into a final high-purity product

The company recently announced the acquisition of 36 additional mineral claims in Quebec, on the Lac Brule property. The project is road accessible, approximately 64km from Labrieville, which will keep transport costs low for the company.

**ORF Technologies:**

Temas has purchased 50% of ORF Technologies, a portfolio of patents related to mineral extraction that has been developed over 50 years at a cost in excess of $20 million. The ORF technology suite will be used to support Temas’ internal La Blache Project development as well as unrelated third-party mining projects. The anticipated mineralization from the newly acquired project in Quebec will be ideal feedstock for the ORF Processing Technology that Temas is now a part of. ORF technology can significantly reduce processing costs (30-50%) and allow for on-site metal production. When applied to TiO2 recovery process, ORF can reduce production costs by 69%. This process is also much more environmentally friendly than the conventional methods and is perfectly aligned with ESG policies.

Temas plans to also apply this environmentally-friendly technology to Nickel extraction. The market for Nickel is huge right now as it is an essential mineral in EV batteries. Here’s an applicable quote from Elon Musk, said during a Tesla quarterly conference in 2020, ""Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel… Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.""

**MetaLeach:**

Temas also has an exclusive sales agreement to license MetaLeach in North America and Europe. MetaLeach is an environmentally friendly leaching technology with a focus on ammonia This processing technology has been demonstrated to be 144.8% more cost-efficient than conventional processes. MetaLeach portfolio consists of AmmLeach, NickeLeach, HyperLeach and MoReLeach. These were developed over more than 10 years of global research & development.

For an overview of these technologies visit: [http://temasresources.com/our-business/metaleach/](http://temasresources.com/our-business/metaleach/)

**Recent Developments:**

Temas also recently announced a joint venture with Erin Resources to earn up to a 50% undivided interest in its Piskanja Borate Project located in Serbia. Europe consumes 18% of boron globally and this will be the first boron production in the EU, which Serbia is expected to join by 2024. The Piskanja Borate Project is located in a historical mining region in close proximity to critical infrastructure. You don't hear much about Boron but demand for it is growing rapidly. It is heavily used in city and building construction, agriculture and energy saving applications. Cloudbreak Technologies, a project generator with an extremely skilled and experienced team, has a 15.8% stake in this project.

Mineral Estimate Highlight:

* NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource of 7.8 million indicated tonnes ( 31.0% B2O3), in addition to 3.4 million inferred tonnes (28.6% B2O3)
* 12% B2O3 cut-off used

Temas (CSE: TMAS) looks like it could be a great sneaky play as they are tapping into some of the most overlooked minerals that are also in high demand. ORF and MetaLeach will help them to maximize efficiency at their projects and should equate to value creation for shareholders. Looking forward to hearing more from them!

"What do you think of this strategy?I’m not sure which countries, these types of stocks are available (ETP) 

I know you’re not supposed to invest in these types of stocks long term because of decay etc but aside from that point. 

I invested in ‘Tesla 3x long granite shares’ in an ISA (20K / year tax free & any gains are tax free) 
Put 12,800 between April - October which increased to 50k. Sold 5k before Elon said he will sell 10% of his Tesla stock (17 million shares) and since that my shares have gone down from 45k to 30k. 

Since he has only sold 37% of those 17 million (10.64 million remaining to sell) which has driven the stock down 15.41% - and the 3x long Tesla down by 45.5%. 

My thinking is, to put it all into the short Tesla 3x (which gained 54.5%) in that same week. Assuming as he continues to sell the remaining 63% the stock will drop at least as much as the first week meaning I would hypothetically get a 55% increase. 

Then sell out of the short 3x position as he gets close to having sold all of the shares which he needs to sell.

# Talking Points

**bull case**

 

1. Tembo e-LV is cumulating $500m+ in 6 deals with worldwide distributors. Total orders should amount to 6000+ EV kits.   
 
2. [During the second half of the financial year, Tembo accelerated the development of its 72kWh battery platform for the Landcruiser model in accordance with the highest automotive product development process standards, in close cooperation with GB Auto and Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited. In recent months, Tembo’s team of engineers have collectively developed an enhanced product, which is undergoing extensive testing and at the same time as the first customer prototype vehicles for this enhanced product are being assembled in Australia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJFqF12drYM&t=170s)  
 
3. Small float, 20m outstanding shares with 50% of insider ownership. Arowana holdings which is led by the same CEO owns over 7m shares as of august 2021.  
 
4. Analyst price target of 19$ based on [a DCF model](https://www.edisongroup.com/publication/ev-platform-for-growth/29178/)[ with assumptions of 5,000 EVs in 2025 (every change of 1,000 vehicles has an impact of c $5 a share on their valuation). ](https://www.edisongroup.com/publication/ev-platform-for-growth/29178/)  
 
5. Complementarity between their three subsidiaries, offering turn-key solutions for decarbonization of manufacturing and industrial processes (all-in-one, solar, batteries and EVs).  
 
6. Very strong tailwind from a macro economic perspective, especially for battery metals mining operations that will have to offer a sustainable product to EV manufacturers. 
7. Growing list of costs and expenses could mean greater dilution as the Company try to ramp up Tembo's production and different SES verticals are developed. As of 30 June 2020, there were 13,557,376 ordinary shares in issue now to 20,641,995 ordinary shares issued and outstanding on August 18, 2021
8. Cost and scarcity of raw materials for battery and solar arrays systems might be detrimental to the cost of goods.  


**Bear case**  
 

1. High risks of failing execution on the EV segment.  
 
2. Cost of goods is high. Currently gross profit is at 16%, [Based upon VivoPower’s management estimates, ](https://sec.report/Document/0001437749-21-024020/)[the Company believes that, once prototype and test production is complete and full scale series production commences, it could achieve gross margins of between 25% and 33% under the Distribution Agreements.](https://sec.report/Document/0001437749-21-024020/)  
 
3. Competition is starting to get tougher, what once was the hedge of Tembo products is now becoming mainstream. With Ford announcing an all-electric F-150 and Tesla with their Cybertruck, the pick up segment should get more players in the next 2-3 years.  
 
4. Shareholders on social media platforms will agree with the affirmation that holding VVPR is a frustrating effort.  
 
5. The US solar portfolio have seen major drawbacks, with over 600MWdc cancelled or stalled.  
 
6. Cost and scarcity of raw materials for battery and solar arrays systems might be detrimental to the cost of goods.  
 
7. Growing list of costs and expenses could mean greater dilution as the Company try to ramp up Tembo's production and different SES verticals are developed. As of 30 June 2020, there were 13,557,376 ordinary shares in issue now to 20,641,995 ordinary shares issued and outstanding on August 18, 2021

"Possible Early Stage EV Exposure? $STS - $STSBFI'm looking to get as much exposure as I can for the EV boom, and I'm way too late for NIO or Tesla..

I found South Star Battery Metals Corp., with an attractive $22m market cap. I'm hard for graphite because it is used 10-15x more in quantity than Lithium in a Lithium-Ion battery.

Why is every other graphite stock already in the 100s of millions in market cap? Am I missing something?

I think Im going to start averaging into $STS before it joins the inflated ranks of $GRAT and $NEXT.

"Temas Resources (CSE: TMAS)(CSE: TMAS) (OTCQB: TMASF) (FSE: 26P)

Temas Resources is focused on the investment and development of processes that allow for environmentally friendly extraction of minerals. They are currently working on advancing its La Blanche Fe-Ti-V projects in Quebec. The La Blanche project is located 100km north of Baie-Comeau, Quebec and is comprised of 176 claims covering 9466.97 hectares.

Fe-Ti-V is an acronym for Magnetite (Fe2O3), Titanium Dioxide (TiO2), and Vanadium Pentoxide (V2O5). There are huge markets for each of these materials, with Titanium dioxide being the largest. Current market size for TiO2 is $15.76 billion, expected to grow at almost 9% per year according to Gran View Research. TiO2 pigments are used in paints and coatings, plastics, paper, building materials, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foods and many other commercial products.

The company recently announced the acquisition of 36 additional mineral claims in Quebec, on the Lac Brule property. The project is road accessible, approximately 64km from Labrieville, which will keep transport costs low for the company.

This announcement comes after the company purchased 50% of ORF Technologies, who’s proprietary technology is expected to set a new industry benchmark for production costs and environmental impact in Titanium oxide production. Temas also has an exclusive sales agreement to license MetaLeach in North America and Europe. MetaLeach is an environmentally friendly leaching technology with a focus on ammonia. The anticipated mineralization from the newly acquired project in Quebec will be ideal feedstock for the ORF Processing Technology that Temas is now a part of. This processing technology has been demonstrated to be 144.8% more cost-efficient than conventional processes. ORF technology significantly reduces processing costs (30-50%) and allows for on-site metal production. When applied to TiO2 recovery process, ORF can reduce production costs by 69%. This process is also much more environmentally friendly than the conventional methods and is perfectly aligned with ESG policies.

Temas plans to apply this environmentally-friendly technology to Nickel extraction. The market for Nickel is huge right now as it is an essential mineral in EV batteries. Here’s an applicable quote from Elon Musk, said during a Tesla quarterly conference in 2020, ""Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel… Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way.""

Temas also recently announced a joint venture with Erin Resources to earn up to a 50% undivided interest in its Piskanja Borate Project located in Serbia. Europe consumes 18% of boron globally and this will be the first boron production in the EU, which Serbia is expected to join by 2024. The Piskanja Borate Project is located in a historical mining region in close proximity to critical infrastructure. You don't hear much about Boron but demand for it is growing rapidly. It is heavily used in city and building construction, agriculture and energy saving applications.

Temas has a lot going on right now, once they can successfully commercialize their patents for licensing I can see this stock popping. What do you guys think of them?

"Top 5 Trending Stocks on Reddit&#x200B;

Hey Everyone,

Wanted to provide an update for the top trending tickers. It is interesting seeing if sentiment is a leading or lagging indicator, as well as the correlation to price. The dashboard is a work in progress but so far it has been useful to track trending stocks and be able to see new tickers on the leaderboard

**Dashboard and Trending Stocks**

Before we jump in, I wanted to provide a bit of background. This is a work in progress so I want to be transparent with how we are tracking these trends. If you have any thoughts on how I can make this more useful please let me know.

**Tracking Mechanics**

* The algorithm pulls data from multiple subreddits using the reddit API. The subreddits it is pulling from are non-stock specific subreddits (i.e. WSB, investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc.)
* It then plots mentions with price over a give timeframe (Right now you can look at 72hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month)
* We also display sentiment, number of posts, comments, and upvotes. Sentiment is determined using Spacy and a text classification dictionary

**Future plans**

* **Twitter (Beta)** \- currently testing a way to capture twitter sentiment. I think there is opportunity to follow and track what a number of the largest Fintwit accounts and corelate to the price movement of smaller cap stocks. This is my hypothesis but I need to test it.
* **Social Trend Score -** ultimately we want to be able to identify trending ticker before the price takes off, or before it drops - we are planning on incorporating data from multiple social platform

**Top 5 Trending Stocks on Reddit**

The screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending tickers this week.

**$TSLA** **- Tesla, Inc**

TSLA has been steadily climbing all week. A ton of social chatter around Tesla and they have earnings coming up this week. I except this to stay at the top of the leaderboard, at least until the end of the week – regardless if the hit or miss earnings

**$GME – GameStop Corp.**

GME is usually in the top 5 trending stocks on Reddit. No surprise that it is still up here. The price has held steady around the $180 to $185 mark and I expect to see the price hold here due to strong support.

**$PROG - Progenity Inc.**

PROG increased by over 56% this past week. About a week ago, Progenity had announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has issued 4 patents related to its ingestible technologies for delivery of therapeutics via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is big news, and why we are seeing an increase in social chatter as well as positive move in stock price.

**$AMC - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc**

AMC is also usually in the top 5 trending on Reddit. Has a strong following as well as a great MAC specific subreddit. We saw it break the $40 mark last week and I expect to continue to see strong support at this price. I think the overall macros trend of people returning to theatres as well as a number of new movie releases will help propel the AMC stock price.

**$LUV - Southwest Airlines Co**

This is a new one on the leaderboard of trending stocks on Reddit. It’s been hanging around the $50 mark last week but there have been some solid DD posts and discussions around the stock. Some people seem to think it is undervalued at these prices, especially with the return of air travel. They faced some issues with flight cancellations but they should be able to get through this turbulent patch.

Overall these are pretty well known stock on reddit, and have large market caps. It is worth checking out the dedicated subreddits for these tickers if you want to find some more info.

"Analysis of promising mineral exploration company Lomiko Metals $LMR(TSX-V: LMR) (OTC: LMRMF) (FSE: DH8C)

Market Cap: $21.5 million 

Shares Price: $0.950

Lomiko Metals engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of resource properties in Canada. It explores for graphite deposits. They hold a 100% interest in its La Loutre graphite development in southern Quebec and 70% interest in the Bourier Lithium Project in Nemaska, Quebec area. They’ve conducted preliminary field explorations and results have revealed the discovery of five new sectors of spodumene-rich (Li) pegmatites, highlighting the potential of the Bourier project. That brings the total to 15 high to moderate prospectively lithium targets on the property. 

Some highlights:

* $18,962 in cash and cash equivalents  
 
* Excellent Metallurgical Results at La Loutre - 97.8% C content and 93.5% Graphite Recovery  
 
* Still pre-revenue  
 
* net loss from operations of $453,000 for TTM, expected from a pre production mineral company  
 

Although Lomiko is not generating revenue at the moment, the company is positioned well with their high grade flake graphite properties in Quebec. The electric car market is going to grow exponentially over the next few decades and there's 92 kgs of graphite in a Tesla. Once their properties begin producing I think this company is going to grow so quickly.

"Investing Philosophy Part III (Can You Actually Beat the Market?) - 9/5/2021 

Hello investors,

[Part I Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/otfytw/investing_psychology_part_i/) (recommended to read beforehand)

For those who are new, I wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding active vs passive investing.

I think the topic for today's discussion is probably the single most important one for all of us, as the answer to the question would determine whether we should even trade in the markets at all.

Why would we ever trade individual stocks, commodities, or other assets if we can't actually ""beat the market""? The market meaning the S&P 500 index or the Dow for those based in the US.

I know this will likely spark lots of criticism and intense discussions.

Therefore, let me preface it with a few points first.

\- This is solely my personal opinion.

\- Your opinion is just as good as mine.

\- Full disclosure, I haven't worked as a portfolio manager at an institution so I certainly lack lots of experience in managing money compared to those who make a living out of managing pension or endowment money.

\- It's completely fine if you disagree. My goal is not to convince you but to help provide resources for people. The more you know the better.

\- I believe that an ""average person"" would be far better off investing in the market index, just as Warren Buffett said.

\- I agree with the academics, investors, and communities that most people shouldn't try to beat the market as most simply don't have enough time to analyze and monitor companies or have the discipline to stay invested in their ideas.

\- Investing is a game of probability, just like poker. This fund is ""more likely"" to beat the market means the fund has a high chance of beating the market, not ""will"" beat the market.

If you have a pair of aces in a poker game, you wouldn't necessarily win the pot but you have a ""high probability"" of winning the pot.

People say poker is a game of luck but there are professional poker players who win over a period of time. I believe the same is true in investing. Not necessarily ""professionals"" but any investor can beat the market with the right amount of discipline and research.

\- Timing the bottom or top is impossible. But it is possible to guess the top or bottom with a probability. For instance, at the end of 2019, was it more likely that we were near the top of the market cycle or bottom? The answer is obvious.

Now with all that said, I'll say the unpopular opinion.

Yes, we can ""beat the market"".

More specifically, I believe it is possible to beat the S&P 500 net of fees even over a long period of time, say 20-30 years, for those with less than $50 million in the portfolio.

Here are my arguments for today's topic.

**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**

**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**

**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**

**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**

But beating the market isn't enough. You have to consistently beat it, for 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years.

I'm sure most of you know that a 1% difference in the 30-year annual return can make a huge difference at the end of the 30-year period due to compounding.

What most probably don't know is the distribution of those returns from a portfolio point of view.

If you make an annual rate of 15% return over the course of 30 years, that doesn't mean you need to make 15% of return every single year in practical terms.

What's happening is that over the course of 30 years, you will make 200% returns, 100% returns 60% returns in the early part of the 30 years, and then slowly decline to 5% annual returns, which altogether make 15% annual return over the course of 30 years.

Theoretically, any investor's portfolio will look something along the lines of this over a time period.

📷

The total compounded annual return is 15%, not the actual annual returns.

This makes sense because, with a $50k portfolio, you will obviously be more concentrated in positions compared to a $50MM portfolio. Therefore, you are taking more ""risk"" in a smaller portfolio.

Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has posted annual returns that look somewhat similar.

📷

If you noticed, the standard deviations are much larger in the earlier part of the years compared to the latter part of the years when the portfolio simply got too big to take that much risk.

In fact, the standard deviation of the returns for the first 20 years is 42% compared to 16% in the last 20 years.

**Where I'm getting at is it is much easier to beat the market by a wide margin with a small-sized portfolio than a large portfolio and therefore, retail investors have a good chance of beating the market, given an appropriate knowledge and discipline.**

It may be common-sense but to reiterate, it is much easier to double a portfolio of $500k than to double a $50 million.

You may think the reason is that you're taking larger risks on smaller portfolios than larger portfolios.

It is true that risks are larger. However, it also depends on how you define ""risk"".

Standard deviations are obviously larger in a smaller portfolio since your absolute size is smaller and therefore, you can't diversify as much.

But standard deviations aren't truly the ""risk"" of a company going under. The true risk of a company going bankrupt is the liquidity, cash flow, and business profile. Even with a concentrated portfolio, I believe it's possible to get large returns with limited ""risks"" as retail investors.

Now, to reduce those idiosyncratic ""risks"" of businesses, we need to apply our ""knowledge"" and ""discipline"".

Which brings to my second argument.

**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**

Most people will sell at lows and buy at highs. We sell at lows because once a stock goes down, our cognitive bias kicks in, called the loss aversion bias. We put more weight on losing $100 than gaining $100 and thus, losing money has more impact on us than gaining money.

This is due to evolutionary psychology and there's a good reason why we were evolved this way but that's a topic of conversation for another day.

We also buy at highs because we tend to follow the herd, getting into the hype of trends and manias. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a strong incentive for people to get in on the EV hype.

People at cocktail parties will brag about their 4x returns on bitcoin or Tesla, which will prompt you to buy them the next day.

Buying at highs and selling at lows are due to a lack of discipline, as the famous investors put it.

This is also the reason why professionals say ""invest in what you know"". If you invest in what you don't know, then you will be tempted to sell when stocks go down because you don't know the company and don't have such a high conviction that it will recover.

As an analogy, I have seen many people make new year's resolutions as losing weight or saving more money to buy a house.

Why is it so hard to do both?

In fact, all of us actually know how to lose weight: eat less and exercise more. Burn more calories than you consume. It's as simple as that.

We also know how to increase the balance on our bank account. Spend less than what you earn, or increase your earnings through side-gigs.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out the solutions to these problems. I believe the same is true for the markets. People generally know which companies will be better off in ten years (Disney, Amazon, JP Morgan, etc.).

So why do people lack the discipline to stick to their plans?

Again, there's a good evolutionary reason which I won't get into in this post.

If Amazon fell 30% today and stayed there fore the next month or two while other EV companies rose 50% in the same time period, most people would be tempted to sell their Amazon and buy those EV companies, hence the ""sell low buy high"" phenomenon.

Take this analysis shown on WSJ.

**The returns of a hypothetical investor who put $10,000 into an S&P 500 index fund at the start of 1980 and missed the market’s five best days through the end of August 2020 would be 38 percentage points lower than those of someone who stayed invested the whole period, according to a Fidelity Investments Inc. analysis.**

This is the significance of self-discipline, the ability to weather through the tough times, or carefully ride the trends.

To gain self-discipline, we need a high conviction. To have a high conviction, we need to do enough research and have a sufficient understanding of the assets we are buying.

As long as we understand that this company will thrive with a high probability, we will more likely to hold onto those positions even in a recession.

**In order to beat the market as an individual investor, we need self-discipline. Self-discipline comes from a high conviction. High conviction comes from enough research and understanding of the security.**

**Security Analysis leads to -> High Conviction leads to -> Self-discipline**

**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**

I'm certainly not saying analyzing individual companies is easy but as an individual investor who lacks the resources and knowledge about a company, it's still possible to know that a company is a fundamentally strong business trading at a reasonable multiple.

For instance, Fiverr is an Israeli company that allows freelancers to offer their services on its platform. It has grown its sales at more than 40% annually with at least 75% gross margin. Would you expect this sort of company to continue growing in the next five to ten years or go bust?

And yes it's trading at too high of a multiple, at 43x LTM P/S.

But think of it this way. If Fiverr grows its sales at 40%, 40%, 30%, 30%, and 30% in the next five years and has a 25% net margin, it'll have $175MM in net income after five years. With a trading multiple of 70 P/E you get $13B market cap in five years, compared to $6.8B market cap right now.

Yes, these are rosy assumptions but I don't need to convince people that a platform with freelancers will only grow in the future.

Many also argue that you can’t win in the market because there are too many big-money professionals and the person on the other side of the trade knows better than I do.

I absolutely agree with that. But it's not a winner-takes-all game.

There doesn’t have to be a single winner. Professional trader's win doesn't mean our loss.

You don’t need those terminals and market data to predict that the stay at home stocks would have outperformed the value stocks since March.

You don’t have to be a genius to know that China will be the next big player in the world or that Chinese companies are poised to outperform maybe some other foreign competitors.

The important aspect to remember is that the retail investors can easily come to the same conclusion as a professional analyst who has spent thousands of hours on research.

The key differences between the professionals and us is the amount of work the professionals put in and the vast amounts of resources they have, both of which lead to higher conviction (therefore, self-discipline) and informational advantage.

That’s why people like Peter Lynch and Buffett likes to say invest in what you know.

By only dealing with what we are familiar with (easy-to-understand companies), we don’t need to use CapIQ or Bloomberg to come to a high conviction that e-commerce will only grow in the future.

If however, we were to take a stab at a company like Exxon Mobil, we need to know how much of their production volumes are hedged, at what oil price are their rigs economical, how will commodity prices impact the stock performance (you need historical correlation data and regression for different time periods), and so on.

Take bond futures. It’s not that hard to know that as long as the Treasury is issuing more than the Fed is buying, there will be a supply overrun and yields will likely go up (of course it's not as simple as that because you need to take into account numerous other factors like inflation and real yields but I'm making a point here). But I only can monitor that from the numerous data points provided by the sell-side research.

The more complicated analyses are where professional investors have an edge.

**To summarize today's post in one sentence, it is possible to beat the market with a small-sized portfolio given a sufficient amount of discipline.**

"KULR Technology Group So, I've been doing some research into KULR technology and wanted to see what everyone thinks.

“KULR technology has virtually unlimited commercial and industrial applications for battery safety, reducing heat and increasing the longevity of electronic components and increasing the efficiency of energy storage.” - Regurgitated on ever web page.

The department of energy filed a report in 2020 and on page 14 of the .pdf they show a graph of the projected market GWh demand over the next 10 years.

[Energy Storage Market Report - Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/12/f81/Energy%20Storage%20Market%20Report%202020_0.pdf)

I think the graph speaks for itself.

That being said, Li-ion battery design is in its infancy. Companies will continue to develop Li-ion batteries in attempt to keep up with this increasing market demand for GWh. As demand for GWh increases, the need for efficient Li-ion batteries will increase. Li-ion batteries provide more energy. Energy creates heat. Heat creates the need for thermal management.

The need for thermal management is a KEY FACTOR in keeping up with the increasing GWh demand.

KULR is the SOLE licensee of the VEGA Internal Short Circuit (ISC) Device and LYRA ISC Trigger Cell. This tech was developed by NREL and NASA, patent below.

[US9142829B2](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0b/ce/a0/8ee68aaabbe10f/US9142829.pdf) \- ISC Device

Essentially KULR is the only licensed manufacturer of a device that can intentionally trigger an ACTUAL internal short circuit. All other ISC tests that exist involve some type of external mechanism. This is extremely valuable for companies because it allows them to trigger thermal propagation in a controlled environment with natural results. They can use this information to develop their batteries thermal management design, ultimately leading to more efficient batteries and safer battery packs.

For example, Elon could use the LYRA/VEGA to test his battery packs. The more reliable data could be used to get his Tesla’s from burning up in the streets and out of the news.

It is in my opinion that KULR's thermal management technology and energy solutions will be superior to competitors because of this exclusivity and extensive R&D. Below are links to their website as well as patents that I was able to find.

[KULR Technology Page](https://kulrtechnology.com/technology/)

[KULR Technology - US Patents](https://docoh.com/patent/by/companyId/1662684)

In addition to the products listed on their website, they also offer battery storage & transportation solutions which have allowed KULR to obtain two DOT permits.

1. DOT Special Permit for Prototype Batteries [(DOT-SP 21167)](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/approvals-and-permits/hazmat/file-serve/offer/SP21167.pdf/2020124878/SP21167)
2. DOT Special Permit for EOL Battery Recycling (DOT-SP 21139)

These provide an alternative to cargo air, ground and maritime shippers. In lieu of applying for approvals (typically takes 6 months to process) they can follow KULR's special permit requests and packaging requirements. Essentially shippers reach out to KULR. KULR provides shippers with guidance, closure instructions, technical support for shipping papers, and even a kit containing the required labeling, marks, etc.

I mean, their tech is on the Mars rover..

"$INDI- Indie Semiconductor -- Tesla/Ford/Apple partnerships: “Empowering the Autotech revolution w/ next generation automotive semiconductors”**TL/DR**: Indie Semiconductor, a recent SPAC merger with $THBR. Indie is an Autotech solutions innovator who produce mixed signal SoC solutions for the areas of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)/Autonomous, Connectivity, User Experience (Apple CarPlay), and Vehicle Electrification. Indie has a $2bn strategic backlog of orders. Of this $2bn, more than $1bn is past the development stage. Already shipped >100M devices to Automotive Tier 1 partners. As of 2020 Indie’s existing solutions could be found within 1 in 4 new vehicles worldwide.

[CNBC Mad Money Interview](https://youtu.be/hRvYNVOjA1w)

**Price Targets**

* Roth Capital- $20
* Benchmark- $17

**What is the Apple connection?**

Apple CarPlay

* “Apple’s massive success with CarPlay paves the way for automotive ambitions.” Indie has already shipped >30M CarPlay units making up 65% market share. [LINK](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/29/apple-carplay-massive-success-paves-way-for-automotive-entry.html)

Apple CarKey

* “Last summer, Apple and BMW announced that users could use their iPhone to unlock car doors or even start the engine, and Apple is participants in a standards group to spread the feature to more car makers.” Indie currently in production of Apple CarKey. (link referenced above)

**Indie FMCW Lidar Integration**

* Indie is currently shipping ultrasound solutions and vision systems for this market segment. In April 2021 they launched new ultrasonic automotive parking-assist solutions. The previous generation of this solution was used in Hyundai Sonata “Smaht Pahk.”
* LiDAR is an area that Indie expects to spearhead growth. Currently in development and expect to commence shipping in 2023 “reducing power by 10x and cost by 20x.”
* See link at bottom for additional product/services.

**Management Team**

* Donald McClymont- Indies CEO and founder. Donald was the previous founder of Axiom Microdevices along with Indies current President, CTO and Chief Engineer. Axiom was acquired by Skyworks in 2009, he then went on to start Indie with the same team to focus on “the next generation of automotive semiconductors.” Donald was recognized by Goldman Sachs as “One of the most intriguing entrepreneurs of 2020.” [LINK](https://investors.indiesemi.com/news/news-details/2020/Goldman-Sachs-Honors-Donald-McClymont-as-One-of-the-Most-Intriguing-Entrepreneurs-of-2020/default.aspx)
* David Aldrich \[Chairman of the Board\] (former CEO of Skyworks Solutions) joined Indies board of directors in early 2021. David is famous for building Skyworks into the company it is today taking them from <$800M to $30bn market cap in 10 years. Apple making up the bulk of this growth.

**Market**

* According to IHS, the global automotive semiconductor market was worth $33bn in 2020 and is projected to grow to $59bn by 2025. The current cause and effect of the semiconductor shortage can be found elsewhere, of which “Indie has been able to profit from the shortage.” [LINK](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/indie-semiconductor-is-profiting-from-auto-chip-shortage-ceo-says.html)
* This past week the senate passed $52bn in funding to the American semiconductor industry. The semiconductor shortage at this point has become a national security risk.

**Financials**

* Indie has a strategic backlog of $2bn; 70% of 2023 revenue in the backlog and 60% of 2025 revenue has already been won. Projected revenue as far as 2022 is 100% in shipping or on won contracts. Indie reports a Q1 revenue of $8.1m (+74% YoY) and a gross margin of 40.3%, expected to grow this number to 59.5% by 2025.
* There is currently 144.7m shares outstanding. At $10 per share this gives an equity value of $1.44bn with >$400M cash on hand.

**Opinion**

* The connection between Indie and Apple is clear. The part that is currently unknown is how deep this connection goes. At the very least we can speculate that Apple, one of the most rigorous and selective companies to work with is currently outsourcing their auto semiconductors to a small startup, a startup who is a front runner to lead the next wave of auto innovation, and who just added to their Board former Skyworks CEO David Alrdrich. The biggest skeptics of Indie will question their lack of clarity on the $2bn in current backlog. This becomes more clear when you break down what companies may be in the backlog, and their notoriety for being extremely secretive.

"How To Find The Best Stocks to Invest In (A Beginner's Guide)Hello everyone, I've been working on a post that can help investors who are just starting out to help narrow down their search when looking for potential investment opportunities. However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us. 

Preface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!

**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**

One of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of “Which stocks are good?” or “How do I find stocks to invest in?”. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the “lack of knowledge” or perhaps they are “intimidated by the market”. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it’s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.

In this article, I’ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it’s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone’s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.

**Pay Attention to the World Around You**

The first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You’ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.   


First, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let’s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I’m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you’ve been working from home? I’m sure you’ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You’re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.

**Build a Watchlist**

Now that we’ve got the brain working a little, it’s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you’ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it’s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)

Organization is key when building your watchlist. You’ll want to have them organized because it’ll help you get a quick glance of what’s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you’ve added to your watchlist periodically, you’ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you’d like to invest in them.

**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**

A great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&P500 are:

&#x200B;

1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)
2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)
3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)
4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)
5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)
6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)
7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)
8. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($JPM)
9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)
10. Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ)

Another way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O’Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).

One of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you’d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:

&#x200B;

1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)
2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)
3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)
4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)
5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)
6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)
7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)
8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)
9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)
10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)

Hopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!

**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**

Another piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don’t really understand how this industry works, don’t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don’t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.   


For me, I’m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I’m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I’m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let’s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!   


Another great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you’ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren’t as customer facing.   


Understanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you’ll know exactly what you’re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you’re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.

**Diversify your Portfolio**

So now, you’ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.

From Investopedia, diversification is a “risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.”   


How do I know what’s diversified enough? Great question, but that’s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It’s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.

Consider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\[%\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)

&#x200B;

* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large
* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large
* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large
* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large
* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large
* Papa John’s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid
* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid
* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid
* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small
* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small

As you can see, we’ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we’d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.   


Of our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. 

Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. 

In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. 

With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. 

As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.

**Now You’re Ready!**

And that’s it, we’ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.

**Can Tesla be Touched?**

Love them or hate them, there is no denying the fact that Tesla has revolutionized the automotive industry. With new EV manufacturers coming out by the dozen, and legacy automakers changing their whole business model/plan to incorporate EV’s many have tried to emulate the success of Tesla; however, none have succeeded. Today I will break down [$TSLA – Tesla Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA) and provide my thoughts on them, so that you get a good understanding of their business as a whole. Without further ado here is my analysis.

**Company Overview:**

Tesla designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and leases Electric Vehicles (EV’s), energy generation/storage systems, and other sustainable energy products. Tesla sells their products directly to their customers through their website and retail locations across the globe.

Tesla is focused on expanding their infrastructure through expanding their vehicle services centers, Mobile service technicians, body shops, super-charging stations, and destination chargers so that they can accelerate the adoption of their products/vehicles.

Tesla’s main goal is to lower the cost-of-ownership of their vehicles, which can be done through increasing the efficiency of their manufacturing process through innovative processes, offering financial services/options to their customers that fit their needs, and by increasing production.

Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, by reducing their costs and innovating their technologies.

Tesla operates in two main reportable segments, which will be broken down in the “Investment Information” section of this report.

**Investment Information:**

*Business Segments:*

*1.* *Automotive Segment:*

This segment includes the automotive design, development, manufacturing, sales/leasing, and automotive regulatory credits portion of Tesla’s business. This segment also includes used vehicle sales, merchandise, and other aspects that are not directly related with producing their vehicles.

This segment includes Tesla’s Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. Furthermore, it will include other models in the future like the Tesla Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, and the new Tesla Roadster.

· **Model 3:** The Model 3 is a 4-door sedan that has been manufactured and sold by Tesla since 2017. The Model 3 has a base price of $45,000 (CAD), and is the cheapest model manufactured for mass-market appeal.

· **Model Y:** Tesla’s Model Y is their SUV that seats up to 7 people. The Model Y has been manufactured and sold by Tesla for a year now and starts at $55,000 (CAD) and still has a mass-market appeal.

· **Model S:** Tesla’s Model S is their 4-door Sedan that they have manufactured and sold for 9 years. The Model S is marketed as more of a luxury vehicle and has a base price of $113,600 (CAD). The Model S is one of Tesla’s best-performing, and longest-range vehicles they offer.

· **Model X:** Tesla’s Model X is their 7-seater SUV that has been manufactured and sold by Tesla since 2015. The Model X offers high-performance and long ranges and is also marketed as their “luxury” offering. The Model X starts at $123,600 (CAD).

· **Cybertruck:** Tesla is yet to start selling their “Cybertruck” models. The Cybertruck was created to capture the market for Electric Trucks and cater to truck owners more so than Tesla’s other models would. The Cybertuck has a base price of approximately $50,000 (CAD)

· **Semi:** There has not been a lot of information released about this project just yet, however they are expected to start at $150,000 USD

· **Roadster:** Once again, there is not a lot of public information about this vehicle, however their production is estimated to start in 2023. What we do know is that it will be fast.

This segment of Tesla’s business brought in revenues of roughly $29.54B in 2020, which is a 28.16% increase YoY. However, the cost of revenue in this segment was $22.93B, which is an increase of 19.61%. Since the revenue growth is larger than the cost of sales growth their margins should be increasing for this segment, which in 2020 they did, moving from 21% (2019) to 26% (2020).

*2.* *Energy Generation/Storage:*

This segment includes the design, manufacturing, installation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation/storage systems under the “Tesla” brand. This segment also includes related products and services of these solar energy systems.

Some of the biggest products in this segment include Tesla’s Powerwall, Powerpack and their Megapack. All of these “packs” are lithium-ion energy storage systems that come with inversion and control technology.

This segment of their business brought in approximately $2B in revenue in 2020, which is an increase of over 30%. However, the cost of sales for this segment in 2020 was 1.98B, which increase by 47.76%, which is not good as the increase in cost of sales should not be this much higher than the revenue growth. In 2020, Tesla barely made a profit on their Energy Generation/Storage Segment of their business. Their margins on this segment decreased from 12% in 2019, to 1% in 2020.

*Battery and Powertrain:*

Tesla has designed their own, proprietary, Powertrain systems that are adaptable, efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. Tesla offers dual-motor powertrain vehicles that maximize traction and performance in their AWD configuration. Additionally, Tesla is constantly looking for ways to improve upon their technology and are planning to introduce their tri-motor powertrain for even better performance.

Tesla vigorously tests their technologies, and products by undergoing extensive R&D processes that are meant to improve their battery cells, packs, and systems to deliver the best performance and drive. Tesla is currently developing a new, proprietary lithium-ion battery cell to maximize their productive efficiencies.

*Self-Driving:*

Tesla uses both vision and radar-based sensors to power their autonomous driving features. Furthermore, Tesla is developing additional hardware to efficiently use the field data their cars collect to improve their networks for improved self-driving performance.

Tesla is looking to further improve their [Full Self-Driving (FSD)](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/support/full-self-driving-computer) technologies so that eventually no human driving assistance is required. This should theoretically improve the safety, and efficiency of driving, and change the way we transport.

*Macroeconomic Trends:*

Throughout the pandemic there were many different supply chain issues, and surges in demand that left products at a shortage. Early on in the pandemic, there were toilet paper, mask, and hand sanitizer shortages, later on in the pandemic, there were housing shortages, and lumber shortages. One of the biggest shortages that came from the pandemic and is currently ongoing is the semiconductor and chip shortages.

These shortages have caused ripples in the automotive industry, with many producers both newcomers and legacy automakers having to halt production. As you can imagine, this has had adverse effects on the stock price of these companies making the shortage even more painful for these companies.

However, there was one company who saw this coming and adapted the quickest in order to avoid many of the supply chain issues that plagued other automakers. This company was in fact, Tesla.

This can be observed through a snippet of a shareholder letter, in which they said, “In Q1 we were able to navigate through global chip supply shortage issues in part by pivoting extremely quickly to new microcontrollers, while simultaneously developing firmware for new chips made by new suppliers.” Furthermore, Tesla was said to have stocked up on chips before time, which also helped them to maintain high levels of production amidst the shortage.

It was this quick thinking and decision making that helped Tesla to adapt and overcome this obstacle, while many other companies just took it on the chin. Tesla’s actions/decisions to avoid this shortage is likely to have saved them millions, if not billions of dollars in revenue that would have been foregone.

[Elon Musk Says the Auto Chip Shortage Is Like the Toilet Paper Frenzy (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-chip-shortage-is-like-toilet-paper-frenzy-2021-6)

*Regulatory Credits:*

In 2020, Tesla brought in revenues of $1.6B selling regulatory credits to other automakers who exceeded their emission caps. This is all well and good except for the fact that in 2020, Tesla’s net income was $721M. This means that if regulatory credits were non-existent Tesla would have a net loss in 2020 of $879M. However, we know that regulatory credits exist, and that they are lucrative for EV makers like Tesla, so what is the problem?

In 2021, the competition in the EV space is heating up, as newcomers are starting to release their vehicles (ie $CCIV- Lucid Motors), and there are many different legacy car manufacturers that are starting to design, develop, and produce EV’s of their own (ie $GM – General Motors, $F – Ford etc.). This is bad for Tesla for a variety of reasons.

Firstly, legacy automakers will be reducing their own emissions and will have a decreased demand to buy regulatory credits from other automakers, as they will be able to meet emission standards or be closer to meeting them than before. This should have adverse effects on Tesla, as they currently sell their regulatory credits to other automakers, and if these companies no longer need as many credits as possible, then Tesla will not be able to sell their credits and lose revenues on that portion of their business.

Secondly, there are many newcomers to the space, which is also bad for Tesla and their credit selling. This is because these new companies will also be receiving these credits and selling them to other automakers. This increased supply of regulatory credits is likely to devalue existing credits, which may have severe effects on Tesla’s profitability.

Regulatory Credits are an important factor in Tesla’s business models, and any decline in their regulatory credit sales could have severe effects on the future profitability of Tesla. This is something to keep in mind as an investor, especially if their regulatory credit sales start to slow down.

However, if Tesla can shift its reliance away from regulatory credit and find a way to be profitable through their regular operations, then this worry goes away for many investors, and they may enter positions. I think that Tesla can rely on regulatory credits for the next couple of years as the demand for these credits is not likely to subside in the near term. However, in this time they need to find ways to improve their profitability so they can be self-sustaining moving forward. This is a large speedbump for Tesla, however if they are able to navigate it properly, they will be rewarded.

In their [Q1 2021 investor deck](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22), Tesla reported a net income (in Q1) of $464M, and they also reported $518M in income from regulatory credits. This means Tesla would have only lost $54M without the support of their regulatory credits. Although this is still “bad” it is better than their Q4 2020 results, as they would have lost $105M without the assistance of regulatory credits. This shows that Tesla is moving away from their dependence on these credits rather quickly which is a good sign for investors, and something to keep an eye on.

*Financial Information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Tesla’s revenues were up 28.32% YoY, their gross profits increased by 62.90%, they reported their first ever income from operations, and their total assets increased by 52% YoY. Furthermore, their R&D costs increased by roughly 5% YoY, which is good to see in a business-like Tesla, who needs to keep innovating in order to survive.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** Tesla’s accounts payable almost doubled YoY, their automotive service revenue is down 3.57% YoY, stock-based compensation expenses were up by 93.10% which usually would be alright however this number is very high. Lastly, their regulatory credit revenue of almost $1.6B helped to prop up Tesla’s revenue, however, as more companies convert to electric this revenue source is likely to deteriorate.

· **Stock Based Awards:** As of 2020, Tesla had 66,000,000 shares locked up in their stock-based awards. If these shares were to be put on the market today it would have a dilutionary effect of 7.07% on the already existing shares.

· **Warrants:** As of December 2020, Tesla has 47M shares that can be converted from warrants. If these warrants were to be converted to ordinary shares and sold, this would dilute the pre-existing shares by roughly 5.04%.

· **Convertible Senior Notes:** Lastly, there are 37M ordinary shares that can be converted from senior notes. If these notes were to be converted today, there would be a total dilutionary effect of 3.97%.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I was able to find Tesla’s WACC on a website called [Finbox](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:TSLA/models/wacc), which shows how they arrived at their WACC. This site estimated Tesla’s WACC to be 8%, which I used in my DCF model.

*CAGR:*

I used Tesla’s 2020 EBIT growth rate as my CAGR, which is mainly due to the nature of my DCF model. By doing this I arrived at a CAGR of 20.66% which is somewhat conservative given some of the other CAGR estimates floating around.

*Interest Expense Decrease Rate:*

To find this figure I took the average decrease rate of Tesla’s interest expense (found on Yahoo) over the past 2 years. By doing this I arrived at an average annual interest expense decrease rate of 0.51% which I used in my DCF model.

*Tax Rate:*

I found Tesla’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2020 to be 25% through their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001564590-21-004599/)

*Competition Information:*

In order to get the best results out of my comparable analysis, I had to choose the best companies that emulate the business model and operations of Tesla. Ultimately, I decided to choose the following 4 companies based on the above criteria, these companies are $NIO – Nio Inc., $XPEV - Xpeng, $GM - General Motors, and $LI - Li Auto.

Nio, Xpeng, and Li auto are all Chinese EV manufacturers that are do not threaten Tesla’s operations, however they have similar technology and are at similar stages to their business. Furthermore, these companies (like Tesla) focus solely on manufacturing electric vehicles which makes their operations mimic that of Tesla’s to a certain extent.

Additionally, I have decided to incorporate General Motors as a competitor for a few reasons. Firstly, General Motor’s is located in the USA and has committed to a large investment in order to start manufacturing competitive EV’s. Furthermore, GM has pledged to release 30 different EV’s by 2025 and are committing to an all-electric future. GM poses a bigger threat Domestically and Internationally to Tesla than the other Chinese EV companies (at least currently) and GM is a legacy vehicle maker with the capability to produce large amounts of EV’s.

**Investment Valuation:**

There were two ways in which I was able to value Tesla in order to see if it is currently undervalued, overvalued, or properly valued. These methods include a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model, and a Comparable Analysis.

*DCF:*

My DCF model discounts Tesla’s projected Free Cash Flows (FCF’s) over the next 10 years. I was able to conduct this analysis through various pieces of information which can be found above in the “valuation information” section. By undergoing this DCF model I arrived at a fair value of Tesla of $25.94, which implies a downside risk of 95.73%. As you can probably tell, this projection is very low, and their stock is very unlikely to hit this price. However, this DCF shows the extent to which Tesla is overvalued, and why many investors are cautious when looking to invest in Tesla.

Typically, DCF models are not used to value high-growth companies like Tesla, and often there is not enough data or good enough financials in these high growth companies in order to even conduct a DCF model. For this reason, I am not focusing on the results of the DCF too much, however it is good to know this information.

*Comparable Analyses:*

In order to do a well-rounded comparable analysis, I decided to compare Tesla’s [EV/Assets](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/ev-to-assets/), [EV/Revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ev-revenue-multiple.asp), and [P/B](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/using-price-to-book-ratio-evaluate-companies/) to their main competitors as listed in the “Competition Information” section of this report. Since all of the comparable companies are high-growth Electric Vehicle companies, the comparable ratio’s/multiple’s that I chose were the only 3 that I could choose given the negative ratio’s/multiples of Tesla and in some cases their competitors.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Tesla’s EV/Assets multiple against their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of Tesla of $149.81, which would imply a downside risk of 75.35%. This is a large downside, so I decided to compare the other ratios to see if tis result was consistent among them.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Tesla’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, I found that tesla has a fair value of $248.45, which would imply a downside of 59.12%. This downside is not as severe as the implied downside through the EV/Assets comparable, however it is in agreeance with that comparable based on the fact that Tesla is overvalued. Additionally, I decided to undergo one last comparison to further validate/invalidate this idea.

*P/B:*

By comparing Tesla’s P/B ratio to that of their competitor’s I arrived at a fair value of $331.15, which would imply a potential downside of 45.51%. Once again, this downside less than that achieved by the other comparable analyses, however they all agree on the fact that Tesla is overvalued. To get one final comparable price estimate I decided to take the average of my 3 comparable results.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result of each comparable, I arrived at one all-encompassing valuation of Tesla of $243.14, which would imply a share price decrease of 59.99%. This is implying a large decrease in the share price, which most likely will not happen, however knowing Tesla is this overvalued is concerning. There are some problems with my comparable that I will discuss next.

*Potential Problems:*

In my comparable analyses, I was comparing Tesla to Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto, and General Motors, and there are some problems that came from doing this.

Firstly, Nio, Xpeng, and Li Auto are all Chinese securities. This could be considered a problem given the nature of Chinese stocks being severely undervalued. Historically, Chinese stocks have been heavily discounted in comparison to many American stocks because of the diplomatic and political uncertainties in China, and as a result people are willing to pay less for these stocks. This is a problem because their low financial ratios and multiples that come with being undervalued are exaggerating how overvalued Tesla really is.

Next, there is some problems that arise with choosing GM as a comparable company. Firstly, GM is a legacy automaker that has historically manufactured cars that run solely on fossil fuels. As a result of this, they have already made significant revenues and are at a different stage in their business than Tesla is. This helps to make GM’s ratios lower than any EV manufacturer can be at given the current state of EV companies. This makes Tesla look ridiculously overvalued, when in fact it is just comparing apples to oranges in a sense.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Currently, through warrants, stock awards, and convertible notes, there is a maximum share price dilution of 16.08% that is possible. However, this dilution is likely to be spread across the next 5-10 years, which minimizes the immediate effect of it. This dilution may seem high, however for high-growth companies like Tesla this level of dilution is quite standard and is lower than most.

· **Regulatory Credits:** Currently, Tesla depends on the income generated through their regulatory credits in order to have a positive net income and there are some concerns with this. There is a lot of uncertainty that lies in these credits, as the rules around them can be changed, however if Tesla finds a way to phase out their dependence on these credits or generate a net income without their help than these worries will for the most part subside.

· **Macroeconomic Conditions:** As I mentioned before Tesla was able to forecast the chip and semiconductor shortages which worked out well for them. However, there is bound to be other macro factors that are going to be thrown at Tesla, and if they are not prepared for them, they could face adverse effects.

· **Expectations:** Tesla has a lot of large expectations from their investors for the future, however Tesla has previously failed to deliver on some of these expectations and will likely fail to meet some expectations in the future as well. A good example of how this is a risk and effects their share price was through [their recent cancellation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/elon-musk-says-tesla-officially-canceled-the-model-s-plaid-plus.html) of their Model S “Plaid”, after this news broke Tesla fell 0.25%, which may not seem like a lot, however the EV sector as a whole was up around 1%. This example was a smaller deadline on one product release, however there are larger expectations that will have catastrophic effects if not met.

· **Elon Musk:** Elon Musk has been the backbone of Tesla for a long time and has a very important role in the company. However, in the past his sporadic tweets have had negative effects on Tesla’s share price, a famous example of this Is when he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184?lang=en) “Tesla stock too high IMO” after which their share price dropped 10%. Recently, his tweets have been influencing the crypto markets, however if he starts to tweet about Tesla things could get ugly. Furthermore, if Musk steps down from Tesla (like Bezos did with Amazon) their stock could take a hit.

**Catalysts:**

· **Green Act:** I did not talk about this during the article because I do not believe this has been confirmed yet. However, the [proposed Green Act](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/global-equities-research-10-catalysts-for-tesla) has been estimated to grant Federal tax credits of up to $7,000 for the next 400,000 Tesla vehicles sold. This will help sway the decisions of people who are on the fence about buying a Tesla and should help Tesla to drive sales.

· **Expanding into New Countries/Geographies:** Recently, Tesla has exported their vehicles to Japan, Hong Kong, Poland, and Turkey, which is great. If Tesla continues to expand their presence Internationally and announce that they are expanding their operations into new countries, investors will be excited, and their share price should pop.

· **New Vehicle/Factory Announcements:** If Tesla announces that they are going to build another factory, or they announce that they have started production on a new model (ie. Cybertruck) then this announcement could help to rally the shareholders and help the stock.

· **Financial Performance:** If Tesla can continue to grow and become more profitable in the future, this will be great for the company, and if they are able to exceed the already high expectations, then their share price will benefit greatly. One thing in particular to watch out for is when they can become profitable without the assistance of regulatory credits as it will send a message to the doubters about Tesla’s ability to make their own profits.

It took a lot of effort to research/make this post, so I would greatly appreciate it if you followed me [here.](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=R&utm_medium=T%26B&utm_campaign=TSLA)",06-17-2021
"Why $NIO is so much more than just the ""Tesla of China""! (DD)I am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name [$NIO – NIO Inc.,](https://utradea.com/stocks/NIO) and I am sure that you have heard them been called the “Tesla of China” but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA). However, this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology (especially in their swappable batteries) than Tesla does. Nio is up nearly 1000% on the year, so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified.

**Company Overview:**

Nio is a leading manufacturer of premium, smart, electric vehicles. Nio designs, develops, manufactures, and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China. Furthermore, Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving, digital technology, battery technology and their powertrains, in order to differentiate themselves from their competition.

Nio has industry-leading battery swapping technology, which drives their battery as a service (BaaS) business. Additionally, Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology, which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service (ADaaS) business.

Nio currently sells their vehicles in China, however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets, to capitalize on the growing demand for EV’s. Nio has 4 vehicle models, their ES8, ES6, EC6, and their ET7.

**Investment Information:** 

*Vehicle Offerings:*

· **ES8** is a 6-7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors (240 kW). The ES8 accelerated from 0-100 kph in 4.4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C-NCAP (Chinese New Car Assessment Program) for their safety standards. Lastly, the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge. IN 2020, Nio sold 10,861 of their ES8 models.

· **ES6** is a 5-seat high-performance SUV that features one magnet motor (160 kW) and one induction motor (240 kW). The ES6 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge. In 2020, Nio sold 27,945 of their ES6 models.

· **EC6** is a Coupe SUV that features one (160 kW) magnet motor, and a (240 kW) Induction motor. The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds, and it can go 440 km (70 kWh battery) to 615 km (100 kWh battery) on a single charge. The EC6 also features a 2.1 square meter panoramic glass roof. In 2020, Nio sold a total of 4,922 of their EC6 models, basically just in Q4 alone (16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1/Q2).

· **ET7** is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor (180 kW), and one back Induction motor (300 kW). The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0-100 kph in a mere 3.9 seconds. The ET7 has 5-star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs. The ET7 also features their computing system (Adam) and super sensing system (Aquila). This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge (with their 150-kWh battery).

*Battery Swapping (BaaS):*

Nio’s battery swapping technology is supported by over 1,200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio’s vehicles. This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge.

Nio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2.0 in 2021, which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs. In 2020, Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1.4 million batteries.

Nio’s Battery as a Service business generates revenue through “battery subscriptions”, in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs. Currently, Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh, and their 100 kWh batteries.

If a customer were to select the 70-kWh subscription, they would enjoy approximately $11,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately $150 (USD).

If a customer selects the 100-kWh subscription plan, they will enjoy approximately $20,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of $231 (USD).

*Autonomous Driving (ADaaS):*

Nio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with “Nio Pilot”, their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Furthermore, Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving (NAD).

Consisting of 23 sensors, a front-facing tri-focal camera, 4 exterior cameras, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver-monitoring camera, **Nio Pilot** is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market. [Nio Pilot](https://www.nio.com/news/new-nio-pilot-option-packs-and-navigation-pilot-2020) has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data.

In January 2021, Nio announced [their Autonomous Driving capabilities (NAD)](https://www.nio.com/nad). The NAD system was developed in-house and features perception algorithms, localization, control strategy software, and platform software. The NAD technology uses their super computing platform “Adam”, and their super sensing system “Aquila”.

Nio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers, through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service. This subscription is estimated to cost users $106 (USD) per month.

*Electric Powertrain:*

Nio has developed, designed, and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception. Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles, and through their Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) Nio is able to continually improve, update, and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver.

Nio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240-kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300-kW 3rd generation induction motor. Additionally, Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW (2nd gen.) to 180 kW (3rd gen.)

It is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers.

*Battery:*

Nio is very committed to R&D and innovating their battery technology. Currently, Nio offers two battery options: their 70-kWh battery, and their 100-kWh battery. 

Their 70-kWh battery is designed, developed and manufactured in-house, and combines Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) NCM prismatic cells, liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems.

Their proprietary and patented 100-kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention, climate thermal management, and bi-directional cloud Building Management Systems (BMS).

Nio has also [announced their 150-kWh battery](https://insideevs.com/news/465188/nio-150-kwh-solid-state-batteries-2022/) which is expected to release in Q4 2022, or Q1 2023, which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative.

*Intellectual Property:*

Nio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey. Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents, patent applications, NDA’s, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses.

Nio currently has 2,654 patents that have been approved, 1,397 patents that are in the application process, 3,373 registered trademarks, 804 trademark applications, 133 copyrights, and 686 registered domain names.

*Financial information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Vehicle sales are up by 106.08% YoY, and their cost of sales is only up by 63.72%, which means that their margins are improving. This year was Nio’s first year having a gross profit, which equalled $287M (USD). Their SG&A expenses decreased by 27.88% YoY, which is good and helps their margins. Lastly, Nio decreased their operating loss by 58.42% which shows that they are making their way towards profitability, which would be a huge milestone.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** R&D expense decreased by 43.82% YoY. While this usually is a good sign, R&D is important to Nio’s business model and future successes, so I would like this figure to be higher. Although Nio decreased their operating losses, they still reported a $706M operating loss (USD) and a $813M net loss, this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors.

· **Stock Incentive Plan:** Nio’s stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio’s business. Under their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock plans, there are currently 79.32M shares outstanding, that have yet to have been granted. If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted, it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6.45%.

· **Share Options:** As of December 31st, 2020, there are 32.5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised (and converted into common shares). If these options were to be exercised, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2.6%.

· **Restricted Shares Outstanding:** Currently, there are 1,735,744 shares outstanding that are classified as “restricted”, these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time, these shares have a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0.14% over 3.6 years, which is essentially negligible.

*Management Team:*

One of the most important aspects of high-growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company. We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again, so it important to know the management team, their experience, and their track record(s). With that being said, lets dive into Nio’s management team.

· **Bin Li (CEO & Chairman):** Mr. Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E-commerce Co. from 2000-2006. After that, Mr. Li served as the chairman of the board of Bitauto Holdings. (Formerly listed on the NYSE. Mr. Li has also been named as one of the top 10 most influential/distinguishable people in China’s automotive industry by CADA in 2008. As we can see Mr. Li has a history in the automotive space and is a distinguished person in the space as well, which can help vouch for his credibility.

· **Lihong Qin (President & Director):** Prior to Nio, Mr. Qin was the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Director at Longfor Properties Co. from 2008-2014. Mr. Qin also served as a Senior Consultant and Deputy GM of Anhui Chery Automobile Sales and Service Company form 2005-2008. Mr. Qin has both a background in the Auto Industry (though Anhui Chery) and in the field of management (through Longfor Properties).

· **Feng Shen (Executive VP):** Mr. Shen worked in several executive management roles prior to working at Nio. Mr. Shen was the President and CTO at Polestar China, President and VP at Volvo Cars China and Volvo Asia-Pacific, Chairman at China-Sweden Traffic Safety Research Center from 2010-2017. Prior to this he worked at Ford Motor Company as a Powertrain manager. Mr. Shen has extensive experience in both the management space (Polestar and China-Sweden Traffic), and the automotive industry (Ford, and Volvo).

· **Xin Zhou (Executive VP):** Mr. Zhou served as the Executive Director at Qoros Automotive C. from 2009-2015, and prior to this was the Engagement Manager at McKinsey Co. from 2007-2009. Mr. Zhou has experience in both the Automotive Industry, as well as in management positions, and his experience will be an asset for Nio in the future.

· **Wei Feng (CFO):** Mr. Feng was previously the Managing Director and Head of the auto/auto parts research team at China International Capital Corp. from 2013-2019. Prior to this he was an industry analyst at Everbright Securities from 2010-2013. Mr.Feng has great experience in the financial industry, and has focused on the auto industry and researching the industry. 

· **Ganesh Iyer (Chief Information Officer):** Mr.Iyer has over 32 years of experience In the autonomous technology, hi-tech, manufacturing, and telecom industries. Mr. Iyer was previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012-2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010-2012. Mr. Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression/growth at Nio.

**Investment Valuation:** 

The only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses. These analyses will compare some of Nio’s financial ratio’s/multiples to that of their competitors.

*Comparable Analysis #1:*

In this comparable I compared Nio’s financial ratios to that of [$TSLA – Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA), [$XPEV – Xpeng](https://utradea.com/stocks/XPEV), and [$LI – Li Auto](https://utradea.com/stocks/LI).

*EV/Assets:*

When comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (as listed above), I found that Nio has a fair value of $257.66, which wouldimply a share price increase of 453.39%. This is very optimistic, so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent.

*EV/Revenue:*

By Comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive), I found that Nio is $196.70, which implies an increase in value of 322.47%. This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV/Assets comparable, so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $45.19 per share, which would imply a downside risk of 2.94%. This is inconstant with the other 2 results, so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation.

*Average Comparable #1:*

By taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all-encompassing price target of $166.51, which would imply a price increase of 257.62%.

*Comparable #2:*

I decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable. I did this for a variety of reasons, which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies, Tesla being the only company located outside of China (this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued, so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense), and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their ***current*** geographical reach.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto, I found that Nio’s fair value is approximately $51.64, which would imply a share price increase of 10.91%. this is very reasonable, however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to Li Auto (because XPeng does not have a positive EV/Revenue multiple), I arrived at a fair value of Nio of $52.00, which would imply an upside of 11.68%. Once again, this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV/Assets comparable.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B multiple to their Chinese competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $37.46, which implies a downside risk of 19.54%. This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses, and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value.

*Average Comparable #2:*

By taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis (w/o Tesla), I achieved one all-encompassing fair value of $47.03, which implies an upside of 1.07%, meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors.

*My Thoughts:*

I think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock. I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside. The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish, and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish. I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally, as they will likely start to be valued as less of a “Chinese stock” and more of a legitimate EV company.

I think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio’s financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track, since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now. But other than this, Nio is looking very bullish.

**Risks:** 

· **Dilution:** Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price, these streams consist of Nio’s Share Incentive Plan, Stock Options, and Restricted Stock Units. All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9.19%, which is not bad. Typically, high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution, and some of Nio’s dilution is spread over 3 years, so I do not see this being a huge risk, although it is worth keeping in mind.

· **Financial Performance**: Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of $706M and $813M respectively, this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see. Furthermore, Nio almost cut their R&D spending by ½, which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China/the World.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Nio exhibited great growth YOY, while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth. Furthermore, Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly. If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports/position, and become profitable in the near future, then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Social Sentiment Tracker](https://utradea.com/feed), Nio is currently the 20th, 16th, and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4, 24, and 48 hours respectively, with an overall positive sentiment. As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current/future investor.

· **Technology:** Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology, moving from their 1st to 2nd, and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains. Nio has consistently been improving their motors (both magnet and induction) to futher the technology of their EV’s and offer superior range. Furthermore, Nio is set to release their 150-kWh battery in late 2022, this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km, if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot, which will help show Nio’s superior technology.

As you can imagine, this analysis too a lot of time for me to put together, so I would greatly appreciate it if you [follow me](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=NIO) to read my previous posts nd stay up-to-date on my new posts!",06-15-2021

"Peloton (PTON) - A Hardware or Software Play (Full DD)**Overview**

We all know Peloton as the popular home-workout brand. Is the company purely a covid play or were they always destined for success? WallStreet seems to valuate the company as a low-margin hardware company, but should that really be the case? We’ll go through some of the ins and outs of the company’s metrics, potential risks, catalysts, and a look at the company’s growth as the world re-opens from lockdowns.

**Covid play or is this the new trend?**

It could be debated that Peloton would not be where they are today without covid and the global lockdowns that occurred. However, were they truly a covid play or did the virus simply speed up the process of them becoming a home-workout powerhouse? The world is re-opening, but demand for their bikes are still at peak. The CEO noted in their latest earnings call (Feb-04-2021) that even with the vaccine roll-out demand for the bike has not decreased.

“We still have not seen any softening since that vaccine was announced and since the vaccine has been rolling out. We haven't seen any softening of demand.”

A look at Google search trends for the term “Peloton” as well as their traffic estimation from high-end SEO tools would also suggest that demand has remained consistent.

https://preview.redd.it/y4q1nfjb21u61.png?width=2306&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4267bf91310503a2d41d2d0537b1f231e5fdfe

https://preview.redd.it/9itvya5c21u61.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fbf05ce5faf85ce1096c43179c7fa913683a845

Peloton has been accurate with their next-quarter guidance and they’ve been beating estimates consistently, but they seem to slightly sand-bag full-year guidance creating “easy beats”. Let’s go through a few factors that make Peloton the strong company that they are, and a deep dive into some of the growth they can expect post-covid.

**Brand Loyalty** 

Peloton has succeeded in becoming the go-to name for in-home cycling classes, and as they expand, the in-home workout leader. Their brand-loyalty also rivals some of the best of the best. When looking at the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is a ranking of brand loyalty, Peloton has a score in the high 90’s which is a greater score than BOTH Apple and Tesla.

https://preview.redd.it/i9efuhjc21u61.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=291d07b52eb5af66cff2ad8e119c1ae0fc196278

This is attributed to the high-quality content the company pushes to end-users through their pre-recorded and live classes. Users always have plenty of options when it comes to taking classes with their favorite instructors. Their NPS score is even more evident with the churn-rate Peloton experiences on memberships. Is the churn-rate really that important? In this industry, yes, and in my opinion this is what will differentiate Peloton as more of a tech valuation instead of “just” a hardware company.

To give you reference of how good Peloton’s churn rate is, let’s compare it to Apple TV+ and Netflix. First, the “churn” is the rate of attrition the company experiences over a time-period. Basically it means how often they are **losing** customers. AppleTV+ has a [20% churn rate](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/), which is quite high, while Netflix has a [churn rate of 3%](https://www.appleworld.today/2020/12/09/report-apple-tv-has-20-churn-rate-compared-to-about-3-for-netflix/). So what was Peloton’s churn rate last quarter? 0.76%, some of the lowest levels in *any* industry. The company has consistently had churn under 1% since the Pandemic began, and they expect churn to remain under 0.80% for the foreseeable future. You must remember that this number affects the *recurring revenue* source for the company, which is critical for them.

**Big revenue growth, almost no profits. What gives?**

While it’s true that Peloton has been having blow-out quarter after blow-out quarter, they have just barely been profitable. Last quarter (Q2-2021), they did a mere $63.6 million of net income [**on over a billion in revenue**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/dd43f8b8-acc9-443a-bc51-fd26433ec549). Doesn’t look great from the outside, but we have to remember that this company has been selling every single bike they’ve ever produced and can barely keep up with the high demand over the last 4 quarters. They’ve invested aggressively into the expansion of their [**supply chain infrastructure**](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/peloton-production-capacity-factory/585057/) and recently they [**acquired Precor**](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor), another fitness chain with strong connections to hotels and gyms, for $420 million. The Precor acquisition will substantially increase domestic manufacturing capabilities for their bike and tread product. Here’s a look at the current OTD (order-to-delivery) times within the USA, from the Peloton website.

https://preview.redd.it/atawi4ld21u61.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f7c80d9416a35a029583c9d1bec87481ea1f221

We can see that even after exponentially increasing their production capacity over the last year customers still need to wait weeks or months to receive the product. Peloton has been working hard to get delivery times down to the desired 1-2 weeks. Management noted that with these aggressive supply chain investments they will be able to get there by Q3 or Q4, 2021. Management commented on OTD times in their last earnings call.

“the successes that we're seeing in getting the order to delivery down and getting our backlog down are 100% based on incredible upgrades, and our manufacturing capacity up to over six times -- 6x increase in just the last 12 months in our capacity of them know -- we're now making more Bikes on a monthly basis than we did in all of fiscal 2018”

Due to covid there’s been a lot of delays (unloading times 4x longer than a year ago) at the west coast port-of-entry that has forced Peloton to re-schedule many deliveries. Another reason why net profits have been affected to such an extant is that Peloton has already started what they expect to be over 100 million expenditure in expediting shipments using more expensive methods (air freight). From the CC:

“Though we're beginning to see the benefits of our extensive supply chain investments, our delivery wait times remain elevated… we are investing over $100 million in expedited shipping to reduce the wait times for our products.

But what I can say is that we do expect that this $100 million, which we recognize is a very large investment. We believe will get us back to normal shipping protocol by the end of this fiscal year… the expedited shipping investment brings down OTD. And that gets inventory into warehouses, which is going to allow us to get aggressive with marketing really for the first time”

**Risks to the downside**

I’m seeing a few notable risks that might have a negative effect on the company. I’ll go through them here:

**Cheaper Competition:** we have a less “premium” brand also entering the scene with NordicTrack now providing similar products at a much lower cost.

**Long delivery times:** It’s only natural that when you go to the checkout page for your brand new Peloton bike and see a delivery time of nearly 2-3 months you might be turned away to a competitor (such as the NordicTrack, ProForm, or SoulCycle bike). However, like we mentioned earlier is that Peloton has extremely high brand loyalty. People want a Peloton, just like they prefer Apple iPhone over Samsung (or vice versa), or Lululemon clothing instead of the off-brand (and much cheaper) at Walmart.

**Re-opening risks:** As the world re-opens the risk of churn becomes higher as well. However, it is my opinion that gym-goers will maintain both their gym membership as well as their Peloton membership. This is not a “one or the other” case. I would not be surprised if Peloton subscriber churn rate stayed under 1% as everything re-opens. A risk to the company none-the-less.

**Low-margin equipment sales:** Back in August 2020, Peloton CEO noted that each bike is sold at nearly break-even, meaning they don’t make any money on the sale. The true net-profit will be locking the user into the Peloton content ecosystem. He also stated that due to the economies of scale they are creating that eventually (and most likely already), they will be making a profit on each bike sold. He also mentions on the Q1 2021 earnings call that both the original Bike and the Bike+ have extremely similar margins. Peloton doesn’t disclose the specific mix of their products that attribute to revenues and how many treads were sold vs bikes vs Bike+, but I think it’s safe to assume that each of their products will have similar margins.

**Freight Pricing Pressure:** This has been quite a challenge for the company. They’ve been maneuvering through logistics issues and have dedicated $100 million to reducing the OTD times to keep new customers happy. Due to covid, this freight pricing pressure might continue for the rest of the year and possibly longer. Management has noted that their forward guidance does already include these inefficiencies, which is obvious because the company’s growth in 2020 would have been much stronger had it been able to fulfill every single order it had on the books.

**Over-investment into supply chain:** There are also some risks associated with all these supply chain investments the company is making. Right now it seems like a smart play to keep up with the demand of bikes and treads, but at what cost? 420 million Precor acquisition, an extra 100 million investment in expediting shipments, further investments into their Taiwan manufacturing site are all cutting deeply into margins. There is risk that 2-3 years from now they have more supply than demand and the question of the validity of these supply-chain investments may come up. However, in my opinion, Peloton management has been doing a great job at managing the difficulties not only with logistics through covid, but also with the explosive growth the company has seen.

**Potential Catalysts**

**International Expansion**

Until now Peloton has been laser-focused on the U.S market. They’ve been slowly [expanding into Europe and Canada](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peloton-expands-to-europe-and-canada-300644577.html), and have just recently opened up the tread market in United Kingdom. From their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had some positive comments to say about European markets:

“U.K. Tread sales have exceeded our expectations, and our early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.”

The demand for Peloton is highest in the United States at the moment, but that doesn’t go to say the product can’t succeed internationally. In my opinion, *when* demand in the U.S starts to decrease it will be off-set by the increase of growth in international markets.

**More on the Precor Acquisition**

Going back a bit more on the Precor acquisition. This was a strategic move by management and will have a two-fold positive effect on the company. The first is that delivery times will finally be shortened with the wide manufacturing footprint that will be created in the U.S. This will also alleviate stress of high shipping costs that the company has incurred. The Precor deal and having a U.S based factory should lead to better performance for Peloton’s bottom line. Second, Precor has very good relationships with channels that Peloton has not yet penetrated. This will help Peloton gain instant-access to some very lucrative end-markets, which include schools, clubs, hotels, and gyms. When asked about the Precor acquisition on their recent earnings call (Q2-2021), management had to say:

“it's been enormous curiosity about what this could mean in terms of delivering a combined Precor Peloton experience in the commercial channel”

They want to get Peloton into all these channels and the possibilities are endless.

**Economies of Scale**

It’s evident the company has been bogged down by extensive costs and “growing pains”. They’ve maneuvered through the Pandemic and are meeting extremely high demand by spending a lot more on shipping and getting product from their factory in Taiwan to the warehouse in the United States. They also have large expenditures on creating content, hiring instructors, and maintaining the quality of product. All this to keep users engaged. With the Precor acquisition, these expenses will become a lower percent of the revenue generated as margins are increased and revenue increases.

**Valuation**

There are quite a few topics I want to touch base on in terms of the company’s valuation. I think if we were to use a benchmark of value, we could look at Nautilus Inc (NLS), which is a fitness equipment manufacturing company, is currently trading at 1x trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenues… On the other side of things, you have tech stocks trading at incredibly high valuations all because they are bringing in high-margin recurring revenue. So the debate will be low-margin hardware versus high-margin recurring revenue. Peloton fits somewhere in the middle.

WallStreet’s main concerns for Peloton are going to be over the company’s margins, and the longevity of the increased “covid” demand. The big question is, what happens when demand slows? After-all, the market is a forward-looking. I want to look at this in two ways. The first is going to be international expansion off-setting a slow in growth in the United States. The second is going to be a look at the recurring revenues and continued subscriber growth over the next 2-3 years.

**Demand**

As with any product, the demand for Peloton products will eventually plateau. Peloton has done well by releasing the new treadmill product, with rumors of a rowing machine and other in-home fitness equipment. I would not be surprised to see Peloton develop a very robust product line. However, as growth slows in one segment (bikes) a new segment will open up (tread/rower/other products). With 2 million in cash on the balance sheet Peloton is in a great position to expand their brand into other segments both in the domestic USA and internationally.

Peloton’s expansion internationally is still in the very early stages as they’ve only just began to penetrate these markets. Like I touched up on previously, the increased demand internationally will off-set some of the growth slowing in the United States. The end-goal of the company is to increase margins on their hardware products, while selling a lot of it, and then locking users into their ecosystem with the recurring subscription which will be a big money-maker for them.

**Subscriptions**

The subscription revenues, which currently have a 60% gross profit, are going un-noticed with the company’s valuation. In their most recent quarter (Q2-2021) they did over 1.064 billion in revenue. From that revenue, approximately 81.7% came from sales of bikes, treads, and other products in their “connected fitness” segment. The other 18.3% came from subscription revenue. Their “connected fitness” and “subscription revenue” segments also come in with gross profits of 35.3%, and 60.3%, respectively.

Their guidance for Q3-2021 had similar performance to last quarter, where they guided another billion in revenue and an additional 300m subscribers to their network. This is also coming off their holiday season quarter, which generally provides an additional boost in sales. In my opinion, I think it would be safe to assume that continued high demand in the U.S market, with growing international exposure will get the company doing $2 billion in revenue per quarter. Remember that 18.3% of that revenue is recurring from their subscription model. This would generate about $366 million in subscription revenue per quarter, and on a twelve-month basis approximately $1.47 billion per year. Here’s a look at their Q2-2021 revenue and subscriber growth.

https://preview.redd.it/h25r7eaf21u61.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=6639821f05225f9e7a78b205eb5a9993be31b502

Peloton currently has a market cap of $32 billion. *If* the company were to achieve $2 billion revenues per quarter in 1-2 years, which in my opinion is quite probable, then at current valuations they would be trading at 4x sales, with 20% of that coming from recurring subscriptions. Don’t forget they have a strong balance sheet with just over 2 million in cash assets for future investments.

I like the stock and would like to invest in it while it is trading at a market cap below 10-15x revenues. At that same valuation today they would be priced at $180 instead of $110.

**TLDR;**

1. The company has had blowout quarter after blowout quarter, but barely turning a profit. They have been experiencing “growing pains” and invested heavily into their supply chain infrastructure. $420 million Precor acquisition, $100 million in *additional* expedited shipping costs, and digital content production have cut heavily into their margins.
2. They are doing $1 billion revenues per quarter and with steady growth they might get up to $2 billion per quarter in 2022. Approximately 20% of that revenue will be *recurring* revenue from their fitness subscription model. Not only that, but they are also adding 300m new subscribers to their ecosystem each quarter. 
3. With all these supply chain infrastructure upgrades they are still selling every single bike they can produce. Management noted that demand has remained high even with global vaccine roll-outs. They are just getting their feet wet with international markets, which could provide another boost in demand.
4. There are a few concerns about the company moving forward, such as: low margin product, over-investment in new factories and acquisitions, long delivery times turning customers to competitors, and re-opening risks. We’ve addressed these above.
5. If the company can prove they are more than a “hardware” manufacturing company WallStreet will give them the proper valuation. They are currently on track to have over 2m paying members to their integrated fitness model and I would not be surprised if they hit over 3-4 million members by 2022.",04-19-2021

Lucid Motors (CCIV) vs Tesla ... this is the way,02-17-2021
"Question for everybody!!!So I’m just wondering what everybody started out with (money wise) in the stock market, how long they’ve been in it, how much they have made now in the stock market and what they are invested in?? I started out with $20k, I have been in for 8 months, I have invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tesla, Amazon and GameStop briefly (even though I lost my ass), and snowflake. I have made $11k the whole time I’ve been in the stock market. So I’m just wondering what everybody else is in and what they have made and started out with because I’m somewhat new to this and trying to figure out the best ones to get into. Thanks in advance!",02-13-2021
"Stocks Manage to Hold It Together Despite Weak SectorsToday in the stock market, the market was relatively weak. What do you expect, though? We can't just climb higher every day. With that being said, we did tag ATHs in the pre-market.

We are coming into this week with just 63 points in the SPX; despite a  weak day today, we are still positive on the week. With energy the only notable sector up large today, we saw the financials weak along with technology. Tesla down 5% didn't help either. It will be interesting to see if we can hold it together tomorrow, or else the VIX could be on its way higher. Catch the stock market break down and see the too trending tickers today!

"Thoughts on CCIV & Lucid motors potential SPAC deal?? 🚀🚀🚀? Degenerate traders welcome 🦆The SPAC formed by former Citigroup banker and Wall Street veteran Michael Klein called CCIV is in TALKS to take electric vehicle (EV) maker Lucid Motors public through a transaction that could be valued at up to $15 billion.

Lucid is one of the more well-known EV makers not yet trading publicly. Its Lucid Air luxury sedan will be available with over 1,000 horsepower and a battery range of 517 miles.

Lucid's first manufacturing facility has been under construction in Arizona leading up to the first production of the Air this spring. The plant will have an initial annual capacity of 30,000 units, with phased expansion planned for up to 400,000 vehicles. 

""Blank check"" companies (SPACs) have been a popular way to go public for new car companies and startups developing technology for electric and self-driving vehicles.

Lucid, led by Tesla's former chief engineer, aims at the luxury auto market.",01-13-2021
"Nio day News and Nio stock Update! ( Post and if you want a youtube video)Hi everyone, so today was Nio day, that is the day all nio investors have been waiting for. Today have been announced so many things that could potentially let nio price skyrocket and this video we’re going to cover the most important news and what they actually mean for nio’s future and nio’s stock price. Also If you want you can watch the video where  I'm also going to analyze nio price prediction and I’m going to tell you what I’m personally going to do now! [https://youtu.be/s2tnh\_0d3IU](https://youtu.be/s2tnh_0d3IU)

For who of you doesn’t know what Nio day is, it is basically the event that Nio utilizes to announce new cars, products and technology. Today A lot of big news were announced, I’ve watched the whole event and now I’m going to cover the most important one. 

The first one is the 150kw solid state battery. It improves energy density by 50% also boosting es8 to 850km, ies6 and esi6 to 900km and the new announced sedan will have 1000km range. Why is this so important? Well first of all, better battery cost less, charge faster and you can drive a lot more, without having to worry about the battery status. Now Nio’s plan is to make vechicles more accessible by lowering battery costs and to do so, they’re making better battery and also they introduced the Battery-as a service, that to make it simple BaaS users can buy a **Nio** car without the **battery** and enjoy more than $10,000 off on all **NIO** models and than they can buy a battery with leasing. The Chinese government is pushing a lot ev cars and especially the ones with baas technology and it’s putting a lot of money in NIo. They offer tons of incentives to buy nio cars and tax write offs. And in china most of the time people generally follow a lot government pushes and recommends. 

For the battery swap, nio in collaboration with the Chinese government is builing 500 BATTERY SWAP 2.0 in various cities across china. They accomodate 3 times more batteries than prior generstion, with a daily capacity of 312 swaps THAT IS AUTONOMOUS. With one tap of the button the swap will be initiated

Also nio new car et7 a new sedan has been announced. Before going into technical details, a new type of car will allow nio to expand in the ev cars market, because right now they’re selling only suv, that yes are the  most sold type of car in china, but they were still out of a big portion of the market. This car is so innovative, I’m going to quickly tell you all the features and than talk generally about the car. it has the FIRST UWB DIGITAL KEY: Centimeter level precision. SOFT CLOSING DOORS AND FRAMELESS WINDOWS AS STANDARD. Microfiber headliner, with 2 massive glass panels on the roof. Renewable materials on the inside for finishes. Invisible smart air vents. Acoustic glass for both the front and back. Massaging, heated and cooled seats as standard. HUD as standard. NOMI AI assistant. 12.8 inch AMOLED center screen. WIFI 6 AND 5G ENABLED. 1000W 23 speaker system as standard with 7.1.4 surround (worlds first) AS STANDARD. This car has a lot of premium features, that normally would cost a lot to put them into the car, completely free in the standard various. And here we can see how big brain is nio. They’re trying to reduce car cost, so ofcourse they can’t put these features as optional, so probably they’re making less profit for each car, but when you see a standar car, that doesn’t cost much but has a lot of premium features, that one of the thing that generally actract the most.  just think that just the audio as optional would be about 1500$ . Also a fun fact Nio's said that it’s new ADAM supercomputer has the computing power of 7 Tesla computers. I personally love the look of the car, and In my opinion it will sell a lot in china excecially considering that there aren’t really any  ev car of this type looking this good in china. ET7 delivery will start in Q1 2022. The car actually costs quite a bit, it’s 70k for the 70kwh battery, while the 80k for the 100kwh battery, But without the battery, the car costs 58k, and the baas price is about 150$ monthly fee for the 70kwh battery and 228 for the 100 kwh. So this reduces a lot the car cost and makes it actually affordable by way more people, considering that probably the car will end up costing about 50k after the incentives and the tax write offs, which is actually a super good price!",01-09-2021
"Tesla Pushes The Nasdaq Higher...Today in the stock market, things got a little dicey. This market is showing minimal signs of slowing down.

Hearing Biden talks of 2k checks and a stimulus package in the trillions is just going to drive stocks and commodities higher. As much as it makes sense to go down, any sort of down day is very short-lived under these market conditions. Going into next week, the SPX is expecting a move of about 77 points. The puts the upper edge at around 3900 and the lower edge at around 3745. Look for these levels to play support/resistance if breached.

"Sell low priced stock with high volume or low volume of high priced stock?Hi guys,

I received some shares from my dad which are in the second biggest German bank, Commerzbank.

They're a lot, like 775 piece, but the price has fallen from like a high of 200 before the financial crisis to 2008 to a meager 10 euro per share. And the last few years, it has barely moved, performing atrociously.

On the other hand, I bought some stocks in Apple, Nvidia, Tesla and they've performed quite well, e.g. Nvidia is up 100%, but I only own a bit, like 20-30 shares.

However, both investments are worth around 8000 dollars lol, and I thought about liquidating one position because I need cash at the moment.

Would you sell option A (huge amounts of Commerzbank shares) or option B (low volume of high-growth stocks) if you needed the money today? And if so, why?",12-20-2023
"Entertaining recommendation for spare change in IRAFinally rolled over some old 401K's from Fidelity into an IRA in my Schwab account.     Put the money in, bought a few thousand shares of some ETF's and life is ok.  Managed to allocate all but $0.06 (6 cents) which I was wiling to ignore.

Since then I've gotten a little bit of interest and cash in my IRA has creeped up to ~$2.50.  Not enough to really do anything with, but I'd rather buy a fractional share of something that can attempt to grow or create dividends rather than leave it in cash.   Plus if more cash shows up I'd like to start figuring out a plan.

So any thoughts on stocks that would be worth throwing spare change at?    And, to be fair, i could just buy a 2% fraction of Apple or some other MANGA stock, or buy an old blue chip or Coke or whatever.... but what would be more entertaining to see in my IRA that won't risk the spare change too much?

$2 invested into a dildo company just for the laughs would be far more amusing than $2 in Tesla.",12-19-2023

Are they shooting for the moon? trying to look like they are ahead of the curb, or masking their slow roll into EV's? Is their Mirai vehicle not working out? Is the Corolla H2 Concept not working out because hydrogen is dangerous? I like Toyota but stock price versus Tesla does not compute.",12-06-2023
"What does TESLA's settlement mean for stockholders?My girlfriend received a [notice regarding C.A. No. 2020-0477-KSJM](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017023033695/tsla-ex99_1.htm).

She already sold her stock. If I understand correctly (and please correct me if I'm mistaken), as a result of the settlement, the directors will have to pay some money back to the company. That could, in turn, affect the stock price.

Since she already sold her stock, one could argue that the company was valued lower than it should have been at the time she sold, because the company had 700M less in cash. 1) can she get any of the money being returned, 2) will she do so if she doesn't do anything in response to this notice, or 2) does she need to do anything to try and get some of that?",11-18-2023
"Taking advantage of a panic sell.90% of portfolio is in boring low risk etf’s or bonds. I’m more concerned with putting a large amount of my income away than maximizing returns.

With that said. Maybe a week or so ago Tesla (4% of my portfolio) sold off like 10% I think. I immediately doubled my position with cash, not margin) today after the stock recovered I sold my original holding for a loss and kept the newer holding that is up 10%.

Was this the right way of doing it? I just felt like it was an opportunity to take advantage of to improve that holding. Hope this makes sense, just wondering what other think. Thanks in advance",11-17-2023

I actually really like Tesla cars in general and believe Tesla will be around for a while. However I would never be caught dead in a cybertruck.

"ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.  
Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.  
Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.

ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.  
  
Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.   
  
HazelTree ranks short bets with a ""Crowdedness Score"" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.  
  
In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).   
  
The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).   
  
The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.   
  
HazelTree said it tracks how ""hot"" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.   
  
Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.   
  
Exxon is down about 6% year-to-date, while Tesla has gained a whopping 76% this year but is dealing with headwinds stemming from uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition that has led to price cuts on its vehicles over the course of 2023. ",11-09-2023
"The case for/against diversifying ex-USA?I've read many people rooting for ex-USA diversification. My question is, what would the drivers of growth be for the rest of the world vs the USA? I could see the case for emerging markets outperforming, but can't really see how developed markets like England, Germany, France, Japan, etc. could out of nowhere just start being super innovative/productive and start cranking out Teslas, Apples, and Microsofts. 

I think at worst the US will perform similarly to these countries, and at best will keep on being the driver of innovation/tech in the world due simply to its culture of innovation and hardcore capitalism (which has many, many cons).

Considering the state of the world, I think defense contracting companies are going to continue to rise.  Would anyone not advise me to invest all that money into Lockheed Martin?",10-18-2023
"Should I remove my current tech stocks from my portfolio?I started investing a considerable amount of money by the end of 2021. Since then, I have been learning and studying different assets and I got interested in tech stocks and ETFs, among other sectors.

Right now techs represent almost 40% of my portfolio (stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla or Spotify and an ETF that includes the 500 top tech US stocks) and after the AI boom I feel very exposed, even though it is not certain if we are heading to a recession nor we are in another tech bubble. I sold Nvidia a couple months ago thinking it would reverse after its huge rise and it actually continued to grow until now. 

What are your thoughts about this? Should I just hold it all? Or maybe it would be a good idea to check and adjust some positions to reduce my exposure until the bubble deflates (if there's such bubble)?",10-18-2023

* Tesla cut the price of some Model 3 and Model Y versions in the U.S. after the company reported third-quarter deliveries that missed market expectations.
* The starting price for the Model 3 is listed at $38,990 on Tesla’s website, down from $40,240 previously.
* The latest round of price cuts comes just days after Tesla reported third-quarter deliveries of 435,059 vehicles, missing analyst expectations and marking a decline from the previous quarter

Tesla cut the price of some Model 3 and Model Y versions in the U.S. after the company reported third-quarter deliveries that missed market expectations.  
  
The starting price for the Model 3 is listed at $38,990 on Tesla’s website, down from $40,240 previously. The long range Model 3 fell from $47,240 to $45,990. And the Model 3 Performance fell to $50,990 from $53,240.  
  
Tesla’s Model Y Performance sports utility vehicle now starts at $52,490, down from a previous price of $54,490.

Beginning at the end of last year, Tesla began cutting the prices of its cars across the world in a bid to stoke demand amid concerns over slowing consumer spending in markets like the U.S. and China and as competition in the electric vehicle space ramped up.

"How Much Is Tesla Worth? You DecideWall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today’s dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla’s other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

> Our model is based on estimates of Tesla’s future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year’s FactSet analyst consensus.

> Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

> Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla’s cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla’s core automotive business now.

> We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company’s cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.

Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.

"Need advice on allocationHello, guys. I need your opinion. I am in my early 30s and I am planning on investing ~200k. I have just made Fidelity Roth IRA account and will be maxing out contributions there (prob 100% VTI) and planning on allocating rest of the funds. I know that portfolio will heavily depend on individual’s risk tolerance, but i was wondering if this break down makes sense in terms of risk management. I will be moving within 2~3 yrs so won’t be starting mortgage any time soon.

Here’s my rough plan: 

30% VOO

30% VTI -> ❗️suggested to VT

20% Fidelity SPAXX that has interest rate of ~4.97% (i assume this is default for cash sitting in Fidelity brokerage account, please correct me if i am wrong) 
-> ❗️suggested to be increased, maybe incorporate other HYSA/CD?

20% into actual stocks - im thinking about around 10-15 conpanies, candidates being tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Apple, Tesla and non-tech companies like Berkshire Hathaway (prob will need ~5 more good retail/nontech companies)
-> ❗️suggested to be decreased, if not 0.




My goal is to hopefully go aggressive enough for 10~15% gains per year and later, put half into mortgage downpayment. -> ❗️realistic annual return ~7%

I would appreciate your comment and advice, any other potential investment recommendations would be great. Thanks!",09-11-2023

And Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization is about $74 billion.(Adjusted for debt makes things look worse, it makes VW as an entity worth less than zero.)That value is despite estimates that VW operating profit in 2022, excluding all of Porsche’s earnings, should come to $13 billion or $14 billion.A company trading for 0.07 times 2022 operating profit ($1 billion divided by $13.5 billion) is hard to reconcile.

"How do I diversify? Trying to move out of single stocks into ETFs.I have a taxable brokerage account worth about 260k currently. 

There are currently 93 positions and account is mainly being carried by big tech stocks (Apple/AMD/Tesla) and a bunch of others for 1-2k each gain/loss.

How do I go about the process of getting out of these single stocks into ETF/Index Funds? I am worried about having to pay taxes on anything I sell but is this just part of the game? Sell something, buy something else, and pay taxes on whatever gains are from the stock I sold?

What about losses? I barely know anything about tax loss harvesting. 

I am kind of just trying to figure out if there is anyway to clean up this portfolio for myself for the future.

Thanks to all in advance!!

"What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?

# Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters

5-6 minutes  
2023-08-08  
Toby Nangle   
The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager  
This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.  
With such a high proportion of a market’s value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.  
Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market’s stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.  
Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.  
In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.  
Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits — even after taking into account dividends.  
Bessembinder’s work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers — with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.  
Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies — even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region’s equity index can be something of a dark art.  
Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L’Oréal collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.  
If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It’s easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally — Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta — might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market’s valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It’s hard to take a view on companies that don’t yet exist.  
I’ve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.  
But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets — or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known — have such a lousy record.  
The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder’s research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.",08-08-2023
"Growth Stocks Ideas Non-TechI’ve been trying to help my dad set up a new portfolio. We’ve decided to go with a split between dividends, and value/growth. I’ve taken care of the dividends side of things with him already, but I’m looking for some growth stocks that he can trade short-term (short term being a time interval of a few weeks to a few months or a year or two). I’ve already taken care of the ETFs side of things, so please, stock recommendations only.

However, he seems to not want to invest in many tech companies, so things like AI or TESLA are out of the pictures. I e tried researching online for growth opportunities in other sectors, and have found a few things, but am wondering if any of you might have some suggestions for me to look into.

One final note. I noticed he prefers stocks that have a current share price below $100. Not a dealbreaker, but it’s what he’s more comfortable with I guess. I know it doesn’t really matter, but it’s his call.

"S&p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AIGreetings!  


I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).  


Investing into S&P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.  


I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.  


With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.   


What would you do and why if AI is the goal ? Just buy the Stocks or ETFs ?

"What Am I Missing in my Analysis?Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). 

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...

So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?",06-29-2023

&#x200B;

I'm currently trying to brainstorm things that may factor into the decision to invest in a company that doesn't rely wholly on impulse. Here are some potential categories that may eventually turn into some sort of journaling or flowchart. I'd love your input as well.

\-What is the short interest? (How many days to cover all shorts based on average volume and total shorted shares? 8 days supposedly it gets hairy for bears)

\-What is the volatility?

\-What pattern is emerging or is it trading?

\-Why is it trading higher or lower? (faith in the product, news, cult of personality, faith in leadership, hedging against presumed cycles, et cetera)

\-Is it near support or resistance?

\-What is the price in relation to moving averages? (9, 20, 50, 200 day)

\-Has there recently been a cross up/down?(Seemingly very reactive on the 4 hour chart)

\-Is it filling a gap?

\-What volume is the price based on? (One trader accidentally paying way over market value at 5 AM doesn't mean everyone is going to pay that)

\-Are fund managers likely buying? (you don't affect the market, they do)

\-Is this a long-term or a short-term play?

\-Some people trade the same stocks every day--What does the chart tell you about their habits? (Does volume drop off at a certain time? Do bears take over early only for the stock to rebound? Does everyone seem to take a long lunch away from their trade station?)

\-Price to book ratio? (If they liquidated today, how much would they still have?)

\-Is this stock moving in sympathy with and industry? (Are there cheaper stocks in this industry trading in sympathy that you could increase profit potential with?)

\-What's coming down the pike? (For instance, currently Tesla is dominating because their charging stations are becoming the industry standard. Also in the news is that Honda and other companies are signing on to an agreement to use blockchain to trace the footprint of the minerals used in their batteries. If this becomes a regulation/requirement, will Tesla drop if less-than-scrupulous sources of lithium are discovered?)

\-Based on your own experience, what might you be able to forecast that others may not due to proximity? (E.G. How many fuel trucks can you see going into the pipelines, how many new fracking rigs can you see from the road, What are the names on the rigs? Et cetera)((Ben Graham said not to invest in things you don't understand, right? You don't understand AI--stay out))

In a market context where commodities prices are becoming less and less predictable, what do you consider to be the most suitable ones for investment at this stage?",04-24-2023
"Lifecore: Opportunity or Bust?Been following Lifecore (ticker: LFCR) for the past few of days. I believe the stock is a compelling long but would appreciate some pushback.

Lifecore is an oddity in the pharma industry. It has two main business branches in two very different sectors. One is the CDMO business that manufactures injectables for drug companies. Another one is their commodity Curation Foods business. Salad, avocado, olive oil, etc. This combination makes no sense at all but if you ever read Joel Greenblatt's fancy title books you'd be intrigued by possible shift in business mix. Perhaps a spin-off or other corporate action would unlock shareholder value...

Well that's exactly what is happening right now. On March 16th, Lifecore made three important announcements.

1. 2023 Q2 results with 11% revenue decline, going concern notice, and statements on breach of covenants.
2. Expansion of contract with existing customer including 10m upfront payment in cash and up to 15m capex reimbursement.
3. Statement on looking for strategic alternative.

So what does this mean for the stock? First trading day after the announcement, the market reacted violently. The stock plunged 70%. High debt level combined with going concern notice and exploration of strategic alternative is almost never a happy marriage and it wasn't a great start. Moreover, in months leading to Q2 announcement, Lifecore issued a note telling investors that previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon due to errors found in its Curation Foods business. Doomed! Or so it seemed. Interestingly, the stock went up 80% on the following trading day and has since held its ground in $3-4 range despite reasonably high borrow fees for shorting this name. Perhaps there's more to the story.

I decided to go over the business this past weekend and found a few more interesting items.

1. The company has an activist investor on the board and has been selling off its Curation Foods business for the last few years. They sold their avocado segment this year and now olive oil sale completes the sale of Curation Foods segment. Prior to this sale, I believe this was the last remaining thorn in Lifecore path towards receiving forbearance from lenders as well as attracting the best possible bids. Lifecore is finally a pure CDMO play well positioned to capture bids from both financial and strategic buyers. These assets are highly valued and often trade at EV/EBITDA multiple of larger than 15 due to regulatory and technical reasons. Lifecore guided around 32.5 million before the meltdown and winning their largest contract to date would most likely push EBITDA run rate to \~40m.
2. The revenue decline only happened for non-material reasons. Their customer pushed the schedule back by a quarter or two and hence the quarter numbers looked disappointing. But this means next quarter or the following one should have higher than normal numbers.
3. The liquidity statement is most likely the result of covenant breach and they should have enough cash on hand to run the business. Why? They just sold their avocado business for 17.5m (goes into paying down debt) and got 38.75m in converts with $7 strike price. They have enough cash to run the business and fund their capex. My best guess is that miscalculating the timing of (2) probably had some impact on the covenants and they now need to negotiate the terms with lenders. Right now these debts are callable at any moment and that's probably why they needed to issue the liquidity statement. Technically, they don’t have enough cash right now to meet the theoretical obligations that could arise from accelerated debt payment. Does it make sense for creditors to call the debts? No. They are much better off letting the sale process go through and getting a kick back for granting forbearance.
4. They hired Morgan Stanley for their strategic alternative process. If Morgan Stanley is the Morgan Stanley I know, they would not advise companies on a tiny 6 million dollar deal that may or may not go through. It's not the olive oil deal that needs Morgan Stanley. This is most likely the sale of the entire company. For what it's worth, when I interviewed for Morgan Stanley internship a while ago, the interviewer told me that they don't look at deals below 500m--pretty sure they do look at smaller deals as well but guessing it's the minority. I went to buyside straight out of college so don't have any first hand experience there but is more or less in line with conversations I had with friends in bulge bracket banks. Moreover, Morgan Stanley advised on a similar deal last year when Alcami traded hands. Lifecore has the right advisor.
5. The interest level in CDMO asset is wild. They have been steadily growing and industry experts I've spoken to all agree that they are most likely getting dozens of bids right now. Given that board owns significant amount of shares and the company has set its sight on sale process, we have the right conditions for maximization of shareholder returns.
6. The short interest increased going into the belated Q2 announcement on March 16th and since then FINRA data suggests that good amount of shorting has taken place. Historically, high short interest led to poor stock performance but occasionally you see stocks like Gamestop and Tesla that totally burns the short sellers. Given that I believe LFCR is a misunderstood situation and borrow fees are relatively high, the elevated short interest offers more reason to yield significant return should forbearance be granted and going concern notice removed.

Why are some people short this name?

Short thesis for this name is fairly straightforward. You have a company with business not matching the debt structure. The loans are current and they don’t have sufficient cash to meet all obligations. They just issued 38.75m in convertibles and even then they breached the covenants so the future looks bleak. Short!

On the other hand, the value of CDMO asset and high borrow rate make such thesis highly risky for the shorts and favorable for those looking at this name from the long side. What is this worth? We can look at other CDMO transactions for some guidance. Somewhat recent rumors of Catalent buyout sent the expectation to almost 20x EBITDA. Pantheon and Cook Pharma were both acquired for around 17 times EBITDA. If you apply a more conservative 15x multiple and subtract net debt, you are looking at a $14-15 stock. Apply 20x and you have a $20 stock.

What I see is a catalyst rich stock with next earnings right around the corner trading far below any reasonable transaction price (note: given that they released their Q2 only a couple of weeks ago Q3 could be delayed by few weeks). Should going concern be resolved by then, I believe people will begin speculating on potential buyout and shorts would be in deep trouble. Why would you be short should lenders agree to forbearance and acquirer could multiples of current price?

Would appreciate any feedback you have. I’m long LFCR but if there’s anything I’m missing happy to know about it.",04-20-2023

"Tesla Finished Down -6.12% After Topping Estimates? How?**Tesla (TSLA) Finished The Trading Session Down -6.12%**

This Comes After Topping First-Quarter Estimates of Deliveries & Production

*How is this possible?*

\- Tesla Delivered 422,875 Vehicles, Beating 421,000 Estimate  
\- Tesla Produced 440,808 Cars, Beating 432,500 Estimate

*So, Why is the Stock Down?*

1. Wall Street is in disagreement of the expectation number. Some people are saying analyst expectations for deliveries were 430,000

But, this isn’t the main reason for Tesla’s Selloff…

2. Tesla should’ve blown it out of the water. You can use either number for the analyst expectations, it doesn’t matter. Deliveries should’ve been more. Barely beating delivery expectations after massive prices cuts to every model isn’t good.",04-03-2023
"What are your Thoughts on REITS?I started investing in one REIT called ellington financial in January, I really love the concept: own a company, hold it long term, make consistent, monthly cash. It feels more in line with actually owning a business vs. holding a stock like Tesla where you can only really make money if people think what you have is valueble.

Ellington is great because you get monthly dividends, 15 cents a share monthly, at 10-15$ a pop I have made a monthly income boost of $35 every single month so far. They seem to be lowish risk to, because people want to keep their dividend they are more inclined to stay in.

"Reallocating my portfolio and had a quick question.So originaly when I got into investing I purchased mostly growth etfs along with some choice stock like Tesla, this was about a year ago or so and everything is down, especially my growth etfs (volatility). I’ve been doing a bunch of reasearch and realized that my dump money into random stocks/ indexes was unsustained and not very safe. I want to sell my indexes and stock and reinvest in indexes such as VTI that are more stable, my concern however is since I am currently down 16% all time with my growth etfs, and VTI is not down that much (since it’s not as volatile) I’ll be loosing money since it’ll be harder to regain the money I’ve already lost. Some VTI wont go up as fast. Advice here? I really just want to reallocate and then forget it and add to it a few times a year periodically, but I don’t want to loose money.",03-13-2023
"Query - What has more impact on an index like NASDAQ-100?NASDAQ-100 closed at 12302.48 yesterday. The previous close was 12290.81. So it gained 11.67 points yesterday. Now percentage wise, the highest price gain was by Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH) 3.77% 1.11 Billion, but the increase in market capitalization was highest by Apple (AAPL) 1.85%  41.5 Billion. 

According to Wikipedia, NASDAQ-100 is ""modified capitalization-weighted index."" So am I right in my inference that though ENPH went up by 3.77%, this would have a much lesser impact on the index price than AAPL going up by 1.85%?  


Similarly, Dexcom (DXCM) was the biggest loser at -7.87% (-3.63 B), but Tesla was biggest loser as per market cap -2.01% ( -13.98 B).  


Smaller changes in bigger companies ( by market cap ) impacts the index more.  Would this be a correct assumption?",03-07-2023

"Investing in Mexico to capitalize on the return of manufacturing to North America?As the title says, Mexico with its low labor cost and available working population could be an ideal country in North America to become the manufacturing hub. On the heel of the upcoming announcement of the Tesla plant opening there, I wonder if we are going to see strong growth in the Mexican economy in the next decade.

"Has anyone heard that a portfolio balanced equally by sector will beat the S&P 500 over time?I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&P 500.

Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.

Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&P by 1.5% to 2% annually.

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.",02-28-2023
"Chat Bots - Where is this technology headed and how to participate?This was an enlightening article for those interested in AI / Chat future.

[https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/](https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

It explains Microsoft's position relative to  OpenAI's Chat\_GPT and Google Bard.  It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed

Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.

As a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.

Circle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  ""And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.""

This is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

""\[NVIDIA\] has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the [computing power](https://techwireasia.com/2022/11/nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-to-build-the-most-powerful-ai-supercomputers/) of the world’s six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.""

Google and Microsoft may have ""the data"" to be leadership in AI.  But they haven't yet touched gloves while the opening bell is still reverberating on what is certain to be a 15 round cage match with a number of other 800 lb gorillas.   Nvidia on the other hand earned [$14.5B revenue](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q323.pdf) TTM on data center hardware -- primarily focused on AI training and inferencing.   So let google and msft and amazon and the rest slug it out -- it's impossible to know who will win.

"Tesla question TSLA - should I keep investing in the current marketHello,

New too this sub 

I have 16 shares in TSLA, they have an average price of $174 purchased I bought some when they were high and some right in the dip so currently I am in the green.

My question is, at the current price around $195 should I still continue to invest? Or should I stick with these 16 and hold.

"Exposure to carbon offset creditsI need the advice of the hive mind here.

My thesis is that carbon offset credits will appreciate in value. As time goes on, supply will go down and demand will go up.

Tesla selling their carbon credits and being able to claim it as revenue is setting a precedent that there is inherent value in carbon credits.

"Tech growth stock portfolio reallocation and diversification out of AppleI'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.

I don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.

I'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:

GOOGL
MSFT
AMZN
TSM
NVDA
META
TSLA

1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!

2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.

3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.

4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.

5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.

6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.

7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.


So Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",02-01-2023
"Will the EV market implode --consequences for investors?Many analysts have insisted that EVs are the future, that car manufacturers like GM, Ford, and Toyota need to do more to move into this space. But from what I see in the data, this entire sector could easily implode within 2-3 years, and simply doesn't have a future in the US. Why?

1. China produces close to 60% of all EV batteries--the US has virtually no domestic construction of these devices
2. The DRC accounts for 70% of all Cobalt mining, and that country is in the Chinese sphere-of-influence (they joined the belt-and-road initiative).
3. The US does not have any meaningful source of Colbalt, Lithium, or other elements needed for the manufacture of batteries. It depends entirely on imports

and then we have other factors:

1. EVs are scarce due to supply-line issues, manufacturing capacity, and logistics. There are very few available from any brand within 100 miles of where I live
2. The price of EVs is going up, not down, and dealerships are routinely slapping 15-20% markups over MSRP for these vehicles, outraging consumers
3. Outside of Tesla's charging network, other networks are plagued with reliability problems, and implementation has largely stalled.
4. The US electrical grid, in many areas, simply cannot support widespread EV adoption
5. With rising interest rates, recession looming, and a weak economy, the average consumer is in no position to shell out $55,000 - $80,000 for an EV

The math doesn't work anywhere here. A hostile power controls the import and manufacture of the components necessary to build these things, they are too expensive, and the grid won't support them.

Goin forward, I am going to look at shorting the stocks of any car manufacturer who is heavily investing in EVs, and the more money they throw at them, the more attractive a short they become.

This whole thing is going to implode with tens of billions in write-downs and widespread plant-closures. Am I wrong?",02-01-2023
tesla counts fsd revenue when the vehicle is delivered to the customer before that it is deferredIt seems shocking to me that so many people down vote the last post I did so I went and looked up the quarterly report. When tesla gets paid for the full fsd it is classifies as deferred revenue until it is delivered to the customer and then it counts as revenue. Do people understand this? My last post was basically the same thing but someone said they don't count revenue since it's deferred in the quarterly report and that as upvoted but if you actually read it which apparently no one does that's not the case. Do they are getting paid for a product that does not yet exist every single car company has a different strategy and its not even known if full fad is possible and no one here in the investing spot bats an eye? Like steven mark ryan cashes in with his patreon by telling gullible people that twsla will be worth 500 trillion dollars. Again Do you people understand that this technology has been promised by a man who only has stock in a company where if he didn't have full fad and record it as revenue that he would be massively in the red and hemorrhaging cash? Can no one see the similarities between tesla and enron????? Foes anyone see red flags here how even the people on this forum can't even read the quarterly report and then they cite profit margins that are again BASED ON A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS NEVER EXISTED AND HAS NOT BEEN SHOW TO BE ACHIEVABLE within the next decade? Every single oem has a different fsd strategy with different hardware etc. Again if someone promised a company that had a cure for lung cancer took cash today and then said ok well have it in 5 years and then every year after pushed back the deadline it would look awfully close to theranos or sbf.......anyone see the red flags heee?,02-01-2023
when people talk about tesla profitability and margins do they comprehend that they are counting fsd revenue?When people talk about profitability of tesla do they comprehend that they are factoring in full fsd and the technology at this point does not exist and that they are saying oh well well have it eventually anyways so we'll just register the profit now. But every single self driving company has a different strategy and no one has EVER built full fsd ever. And there are estimates that it will be in the 2040s before it's made. Do peoppe understand this? Cause essentially enron did the same thing with their accounting and that's what got them into trouble they counted Capex as profit. So a company can do all sorts of things with its accounting. Also it seems like the feds uber low interest rates which still have inflation at 6 or 7 percent which is 3x 3.5x their target seems to be interesting since that directly is a subsidy to growth stocks since rates are effectively negative 6 percent. Do tesla people understand this or are they just obsessed with a man's confident assertions whose whole net worth is in stock which he makes wild assertions about and has every incentive to do so.,02-01-2023
"Best way to invest bonus..Finance geniuses.

"Meta and Amazon Earnings: Time to Buy these Beaten-Down Tech Stocks?Breaking down Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amazon (AMZN) ahead of their upcoming earnings results to see if investors might want to finally buy these beaten-down tech stocks.

**The Nasdaq climbed again through mid-afternoon trading on Friday, alongside the wider market as Wall Street continues to buy tech stocks**

The market faced a big test mid-week and the bulls won out, for now, helping push the S&P 500 back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the 4000 level.

More importantly, the Nasdaq jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time in roughly a year. The market has bought up Tesla since its report, with the stock up 10% in back-to-back sessions. Microsoft stock has already erased its post-earnings pullback to extend its bullish start to 2023.

**The broadly upbeat start to the busy part of quarterly earnings season suggests that Wall Street thinks the earnings downturn is already mostly priced in. If the outlook for earnings does indeed hold up, the market could easily extend its recent bullishness.**

Plus, Wall Street feels the Fed is all but certain to roll out a 0.25% rate hike when its FOMC meeting concludes on February 1. Investors also appear convinced that a Fed pivot is on the horizon sooner than later.

This upbeat market backdrop likely has more and more investors wondering if it is time to dive back into the beaten-down tech titans, with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) as the primary examples.

Meta, formerly Facebook, reports its Q4 FY22 financial results on February 1. The social media giant posted its second consecutive revenue drop in Q3, while its metaverse bet is off to a brutal start.

Meta’s growth days are no doubt over for now. But Wall Street spent a long time beating down the stock to help it more accurately reflect where Meta is in its lifecycle.

Meta's valuation is looking enticing and let’s not forget that it still reached 3.7 billion people a month across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp and nearly 3 billion daily. Meta stock has soared around 70% off its November lows, as investors start to dive back into the company for its ability to play a dominant role in a crucial area of the digital economy and venture into new areas with a balance sheet that’s still very impressive.

**Like Meta, Amazon stock has suffered a massive fall from grace as it too made big bets and faces a major slowdown from its days of huge growth.**

Amazon is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2022 results on February 2. AMZN, under the guidance of CEO Andy Jassy, is fighting to cut costs where it can as it aims to slim down a business that expands from e-commerce and cloud computing to an online pharmacy and movie and TV production.

Amazon’s growth is slowing, but it is still projected to expand its top line by roughly 9% in FY22 and Y23, which is no easy task for a firm set to pull in $510 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. Amazon is still down over 40% from its peaks, including its nearly 25% climb in January.

I'm not suggesting he's going bankrupt or Tesla will disappear... but there was a time that people looked at the stock going to 7k, 10k, 15k. I think those are pipe dreams now, but what's the real, actual potential for the company in the next 5-10 years?

Am I overstating how much Musk drove that price vs. the actual company? It makes cool cars, that some feel have quality control issues.

"""Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany"" and the future of EV competitionI often see interesting articles posted in this sub but don't think this was posted before even though it's over a week old now. So many posts related to Tesla these days, I thought the results of this survey carried out by Der Spiegel would be interesting, in particular for Americans who maybe don't read European media. There are graphs/data on the article page itself.

*Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany* (14/12/2022)

https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/der-spiegel-survey-musk-destroys-tesla-image-in-germany-a-fcc01ca2-d5fe-4c57-ac11-b48a560771f7

Germans have a disastrous view of Tesla, with company founder Elon Musk's behavior hardly helping. Whether from a likeability or quality perspective, the Tesla brand is far behind its German competitors. 

Elon Musk, it would seem, is eager to drag his followers into the abyss of conspiracy theory credulity – but is anyone taking the bait? The top dog of Tesla and Twitter has never been shy when it comes to polarizing statements, of course, but even by his standards, the last several days have been disturbing for his willingness to make right-wing positions his own. He went after the U.S. virologist Anthony Fauci, he has made light of people who want to determine their own sexual identity and he has generally declared war on ""woke."" During an appearance in San Francisco, Musk was booed for several minutes, and actor Billy Baldwin launched a trend with the hashtag #BoycottTesla.

In Germany, the calls for boycott were hardly necessary. That is the clear message of a survey conducted on behalf of DER SPIEGEL by the public opinion research institute Civey. Some 47 percent of the auto enthusiasts surveyed responded that Musk’s current behavior has had a ""clearly negative"" influence on their opinion of Tesla. An additional 16 percent said their reaction has been ""rather negative."" Only 3 percent said they have a ""rather positive"" impression of Musk’s recent behavior, and an additional 6 percent rated their impression as ""clearly positive."" The survey was carried out between Dec. 1 to 9, prior to Musk’s most recent outbursts.

In late October, after Musk took over control of Twitter, a number of public reactions already began indicating that the image of Tesla, the world’s leading electric car brand, was taking a beating. Alena Buyx, chair of the German Ethics Council, said at the time that she was no longer interested in buying a Tesla. ""It’s something you can’t do anymore,” she said.

In the U.S., the public opinion research company Morning Consult reported that Tesla’s popularity has suffered a nosedive primarily among supporters of the Democratic Party, which have traditionally dominated the e-car market. Since the beginning of the year, trust in the Tesla brand had been trending downward only slightly, says Morning Consult, but that Musk’s acquisition of Twitter ""acted as a break in the dam."" Elon Musk’s polarizing personality, the consulting company found, is negatively impacting Tesla.

The new survey commissioned by DER SPIEGEL has now revealed the same impact on the company’s image in Germany as that seen in the U.S. – just nine months after the carmaker opened up a new gigafactory outside of Berlin. And in contrast to the U.S., where Tesla seems poised to replace at least some of its disaffected supporters with new fans among pro-Trump Republicans, the same dynamic is nowhere to be seen in Germany. The broad rejection of Musk’s persona is apparent across all age, professional and educational groups in the country and it is independent of gender, region, family status, degree, religion and political affiliation.

The only exception is among those who proclaim to be supporters of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), with only 35 percent of such respondents saying they had a negative reaction to Musk’s behavior. But even within this group, the negative reactions outweighed the positive (23 percent).

Even without explicit mention of Musk, only 9 percent of Germans said they find Tesla to be ""very"" or ""rather likeable."" Fully 69 percent, by contrast, said they found the manufacturer to be ""less"" or ""not at all likeable."" That makes Tesla by far the least popular company among large carmakers with production sites in Germany, a finding once again independent of political party preference.

The survey revealed more polarization when it comes to Germany’s tradition-rich luxury brands like Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi, which are generally viewed negatively on the left side of the political spectrum, but more positively on the right, with center-left Social Democrats also showing a weakness for Audi. Mass producers like Volkswagen, Opel and Ford, by contrast, tend to be more balanced, or they trigger very little reaction at all. Only Tesla is viewed negatively across all political parties. Musk’s company generates the highest likeability ratings among university students (27 percent), those under the age of 30 (22 percent), voters for the far-left Left Party (21 percent) and civil servants (17 percent). In all cases, though, Tesla supporters make up a clear minority.

Tesla also isn’t able to rely on its aura of being a technological leader. In response to the Civey question as to whether respondents view the vehicles produced by the different brands as high-quality products, only 21 percent answered positively when it came to Tesla.

That value puts Tesla at the very back of the pack, behind even Ford and Opel, both of which are also produced in Germany but which belong to foreign companies. Traditional German producers received top marks on the quality question. But Tesla has also been the focus of numerous negative reports  in the U.S. when it comes to quality and safety, in part because of the disastrous press its driver assistance system has received.

The survey does not allow for conclusions to be drawn on general attitudes in favor of or against electric vehicles. Tesla is the only manufacturer on the list to specialize entirely in e-autos and leads the segment both in Germany and elsewhere in the world when it comes to the number of vehicles registered. But other brands are offering more and more battery-powered vehicles. From January to November, 52,000 new Teslas were registered in Germany, according to the KBA, the German agency responsible for motorized vehicle registration. That represents around one-seventh of all fully electric vehicles in the country, with VW hot on its heels.",12-25-2022
"Are people reading too far into Tesla’s stock losses?Their share price has declined considerably over the past year. Part of that is obviously due to a general decline in equities, with the s&p500 down 20% this year. More of that is due to the general decline in tech stocks (which is what Tesla is generally regarded as), as the nasdaq is down 33% this year. But Tesla went even further than that, and is down 66% this year. 

The reasons people ascribe to this are generally either that the company is in trouble or that it’s because Elon isn’t there to right the ship (or both). But what if Tesla was just dramatically overpriced and it’s only now coming down to earth as first time retail investors who pumped money into stocks irrespective of fundamentals or even sound qualitative reasoning exit the market (which for the past 2 years held, by %, an unusually large proportion of Tesla’s shares)? What if, in a poor macro environment, people have just lost an appetite for risky assets? 

What if, and I know this is speculative, a stock that people were paying $1100 for each $1 in earnings for in 2020 *may* have been overpriced?

On top of all of that, I think some may have overestimated the size of Tesla’s moat and how difficult it would be for other car makers to catch up, and also may have failed to consider the strain increased competition would place on the vital and not exactly abundant supply of inputs necessary to make EVs. But I don’t think this point must necessarily be true to explain Tesla’s share price decline given what I said above. But I do think to some extent the current explanations for Tesla’s share price decline are the result of our tendency to look for a single person to blame for adverse outcomes - although I am not entirely condemning this view in this particular case as Elon being stretched this thin and spending so much time at twitter is objectively cause for some concern.",12-24-2022

"Tesla Q3 earnings call: ""Demand will be harder"" - Elon MuskFirst revenue and earnings:

* Q3 Revenue: $21.45 billion versus $22.09 billion expected **so a miss on top line**
* Q3 Adjusted EPS: $1.05 **beat** versus $1.01 expected

More important, during earnings call Elon admitted **""demand will be harder""** referring to the global recession he expects.

Also when asked about **deliveries** he again used the ""in transit"" argument which makes me wonder he already anticipates a Q4 miss.

Musk also said that 50% annual growth will be ""on average"" in other words he probably knows they won't meet that goal this year.

Overall would not be surprised if Tesla in coming weeks and months **will again miss alot of their targets once hard data comes in, esp. demand and delivery number updates.**

"Apollo Global Management Backing Out of Twitter Financing for Musk([Via Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apollo-global-management-backing-out-of-twitter-financing-for-musk-432SI-2905883)) 

According to Chibuike Oguh from Reuters, Apollo Global Management,  Inc. (APO) is backing out of Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) buyout financing for  Elon Musk. According to a person familiar with the matter, Apollo Global  Management, which was looking to provide $1 billion earlier this year  to Elon Musk for the deal, is no longer in talks with the billionaire.

Twitter shares rose more than 22% yesterday after Bloomberg reported  that Musk is proposing to acquire the company for the original offer  price of $54.20 per share.

Later, it was confirmed that Musk has sent Twitter a letter,  according to which he intends to proceed to close the Twitter  transaction on the original terms. For the last several months, Musk  tried to pull out of the buyout deal due to ongoing disagreement over  the number of spam and bot accounts on the site, prompting a lawsuit  regarding the takeover.

According to Reuters, Musk's changed decision over the deal made  Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) investors fear that the billionaire, who sold over $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier in the year to fund the deal,  was spreading himself too thin.

According to Dan Ives from Wedbush, Musk’s interest in closing the  deal would weigh on Tesla’s shares. ""We see lingering impacts from Musk  stock sales as a drag dissipating but the big worry is Musk juggling too  many balls at the same time,"" Ives said.

Someone has told me Ford is in a mountain of debt because of their transition to electric, but I figured they pay a good dividend and with the high demand of the f150 lightning, they're well positioned to compete with Tesla for US market, and their valuation is down to earth.

"Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This YearShare prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived—and an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans’ behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

“I’ve really been taking a beating,” said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. “I’m uncomfortable.” 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market—including on Friday—only to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven’t yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders’ activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***“The frenzied, frothy behavior isn’t there,” said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. “But that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.” ***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed’s interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

“I fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,” he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters’ college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

“I started off feeling very greedy,” Mr. Tafarella said. “I thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.”

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed’s rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

“I think it’d be silly to sell stocks,” Ms. de Weerdt said. ***“I don’t care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they’re like in 30 years.”***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

>>Individuals’ willingness to backstop markets throughout this year’s selloff demonstrates that the group—for now—has been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

"So what exactly is ""blue chip"" anyway?Recently I got myself sucked into an argument about what is or is not a ""blue chip"" stock. I am very much afraid that I may be wrong, so I wanted to poll everyone else and get their input. (And yes I know people can just look at my post history to see what side of the argument I am on, but I will try and present the choices objectively.)

**A blue chip stock is 'too big to fail' regardless of its age.**

* The theory is that it will be around for a long time in the future simply do to the fact of its enormous size and so much of the economy being dependent on it. The amount of time it has existed in the past is irrelevant. It could very well be a new company that haven't weathered any major bear markets yet. Examples would be Tesla or Facebook

**A blue chip stock is old regardless of its market cap.**

* Again, the theory is that this will be around a long time in the future. But the reason is because it has been around for a long time in the past. It has lived through bear market after bear market after bear market and just simply refuses to die. The overall size and market cap does not factor in. Examples would be Hormel Foods or Emerson Electric.

**A blue chip stock is just fucking expensive.**

* Here, the future longevity is beside the point. The word origin comes from a bit of folklore where a traded back in the 1920s was looking at ticker tape and made an offhand comment about realy giant numbers being shown in the print. In poker, the ""blue chips"" have the highest value so likewise the stocks that are ""blue chips"" have the largest per share price. Could be an old company or new. Could be a big company or small. Examples would be Berkshire.A or Chipotle.

"Musk asks court to reject Twitter’s request for ‘warp speed’ trialRelated post on reddit: [**Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk’s Claims in Four Trial Days**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vyt06k/twitter_says_it_can_beat_musks_claims_in_four/)

(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal

Elon Musk has accused Twitter of an “unjustifiable request to rush” the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.

Musk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.

Lawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter’s lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network — one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal — was “fundamental” to the case and required lengthier investigation and “substantial time for discovery”.

Musk’s lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a “breakneck schedule”.

“Twitter’s sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,” the filing read.

A hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.

The social media company’s lawsuit accused Musk, the world’s richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.

In a case that has captivated the corporate world, Musk’s defence rests on his ability to convince the court that the issue of bots — automated spam accounts — on the platform is far greater than previously disclosed, representing a “material adverse effect” that would give him the ability to back out of the deal.

Musk has alleged Twitter had breached the merger agreement by not sharing sufficient information on fake accounts, a position reiterated in Friday’s filing, which again questioned the company’s long-stated estimate that bots made up less than 5 per cent of users.

Following a meeting between Musk and Twitter’s chief executive Parag Agrawal, “Musk was stunned to discover that Twitter’s process for identifying spam accounts relied on human reviewers to eyeball a minuscule portion of the userbase rather than utilising the company’s machine learning capabilities”, the filing said.

In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Musk had been well aware of the site’s issue with bots, pointing to tweets posted by Musk highlighting the matter prior to the deal.

The social network also accused Musk of breaching the terms of the merger agreement that demanded he not disparage the company, by highlighting his tweets that appeared to be goading Twitter’s leadership.

Addressing that claim, Musk’s filing accused Twitter of being unable to take a joke.

“With the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji,” the filing stated. “Twitter ignores that Musk is its second-largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.”

"Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk’s Claims in Four Trial Days(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. wants a lightning-quick trial to resolve its claim that billionaire Elon Musk wrongfully canceled his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform.

Lawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world’s richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.

Unlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.

The Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk’s Tesla Inc..

Musk and his lawyers didn’t immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter’s schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: “Oh the irony lol.”

A judge hasn’t yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter’s suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.

Twitter’s legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn’t have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.

“Litigation on the schedule Twitter proposes permits the parties and their experienced counsel ample time to assemble a trial record,” the lawyers wrote.

That would provide enough time for a judge to rule and have the Delaware Supreme Court review the ruling before the Oct. 24 closing date for the transaction, the lawyers said.

Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware finance professor and former head of the school’s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, says don’t bet on it.

“I’d say a four-day trial is way more than optimistic,” Elson said Wednesday in an interview. “There’s a lot of water under the bridge on this deal and I’d say it going to take more like 10 days to try it.”

Last year, Musk traveled to Delaware for over challenge from Tesla investors to his more than $2 billion purchase of renewable-power provider SolarCity, a company he founded with his cousins. That case ate up 10 trial days. A judge ultimately concluded Musk didn’t force an overpriced SolarCity acquisition down the throats of his fellow Tesla directors.

"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.",06-27-2022
"Tesla Looking Bullish Again!! Or Really??Tesla has formed a textbook double bottom pattern on the 1-day chart. A similar pattern was seen in the Tesla chart back in March 2022, which took the prices from the lows of $750 to the highs of more than $1150, a rise of more than 50% in less than 30 days.

This time around even if we get a rise of 50%, it'll form a lower high; a price target of $900 for Tesla looks to be on the cards.

This might be fuelled by a small rally in Nasdaq, which seems to get a bounce of 20-30% each time it tests the 200-week SMA, before breaking down eventually.

Would love to know your thoughts.",06-24-2022
"Investors on Reddit have a clear US bias. Here is why you should consider other countries tooUS total market cap as % of GDP is much higher compared to the rest of the world. This number is currently at 150% compared to 120% for Japan, 100% UK and only around 60% for Eurozone. The gap has narrowed over the last few months (US was at 200%), but remains well above historical averages. USD also appreciated by 20% against most other currencies during this period making other markets cheaper.

Now there are good reasons why these markets have a lower valuation. Namely slower growth and demographics. But at the same time I think it more than compensates by being cheaper. 

Consider the Eurozone which is almost 3x cheaper. Structural issues, high debt, Russia conflict. But the countries are working on structural improvements and integration. With the UK gone it will be much easier. Japan has the demographics issue and high debt too. However, yen is currently at a 24 year low, there is no inflation and a massive structural opportunity for higher labour participation and foreign investment. These are areas that the government is working on.

Let's go a bit further and consider some emerging markets. My two favourites are Poland and Indonesia. 

Poland is roughly the size of Spain in terms of population and size, and has a third of its debt. It has one of the best growth prospects in the EU. Excellent geographic location close to the centre. A bridge between east and west. Will massively benefit from the coming integration of Ukraine. However, the total market cap of all public companies there is $180bn. That is roughly the market cap of Adobe. Spain in comparison has a market cap of $800bn.

Indonesia has a market cap of around $400bn which is the size of Nvidia and smaller than Tesla. This is a country with a population almost the same size as the US. Has a huge young working age population that will continue to grow over the next decade fuelling consumption. The country is growing at 5-6% a year. It is arguably becoming one of the next large, low-cost manufacturing centres with many companies abandoning China.

"Opinion: Growth stocks make just as much sense as Value stocks right nowFirstly, when I refer to Growth vs Value, let’s assume I mean the holdings of VUG vs those of VTV. 

Anyway, after spending a couple of hours per day for the last couple of months reading up on the macro economic environment and trying to gauge where things are heading, I have come to the conclusion… It a futile exercise. It’s a very complex system with no underlying unifying logic, and nobody knows a whole lot about where anything is heading right now. 

Regardless, let’s go with the general consensus for arguments sake, that there will be a recession that sets stocks back around another 20% or so which would be 40% or so down from the ATH. 

From my point of view, the fundamentals don’t currently look great for either growth or value stocks. Considering the state of play, there’s no real reason the market as a whole should be higher than it was in say, Jan 2020, but it is. Earnings estimates still look quite rosy from here, so will most likely trend further downwards. Again, who knows. 

Based on the current outlook, prevailing wisdom as of late has encouraged people to shift to value stocks and buckle down with some ‘recession proof’ stocks, or those that do well during periods of inflation. You know the ones; companies with high pricing power, low capital expenditure on operations, ROI on capital higher than cost of capital, high free cash flows, essential to consumers, etc. 

I definitely agree that shifting to value would have been a smart move about 6 months ago, and I am not going to try and argue against investing in inflation resistant stocks, but what I will say is that if you are looking forward and considering acquiring stocks right now to make a return in the long run, value stocks are not necessarily the way to go. Not only do many growth stocks meet the above inflation resistant criteria, but many are getting to attractive prices for the first time in a long while. Case in point, S&P 500 growth stocks are down over 30% from their ATH already. S&P 500 Value stocks are only down 12%. 

Personally, my strategy has been to accumulate iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF while it’s down, and continue acquiring it while it goes further downwards to get a reasonable average price per share for when it rebounds. If you look at the top 10 holdings - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta, Visa, Home Depot - it’s more likely that these companies will recover faster when things eventually improve, and IMO they have better medium to long term prospects, especially at a potentially discounted price. 

Since starting my shift from VOO 3-4 weeks ago as well as investing some spare cash, I’ve gotten in at an average price of $226, which is about 27% down from its ATH. I plan to continue acquiring more during the dips on a regular basis as things get worse. 

My logic is that if my portfolio is made up of large cap growth companies acquired at, let’s say, 35-40% down from their ATH, then even if things are worse than expected, it still shouldn’t take more than a couple years to regain my investment value. 

On the upside, if things are not as bad as expected and things rebound, I’ll have acquired these stocks at a discount.

The reason I’m saying this is because there seems to be this growing consensus that everyone should be looking at low volatility, high dividend, stable value stocks from now on. This would have made sense at the start of the year, but I don’t really see any reason for this now.  It feels like retail investors (like myself) are always a step behind. 

TLDR: IMO, large cap growth stocks will perform better when we eventually begin to recover and nobody knows when this will be. So, instead of being super late to the ‘buy value stocks’ party, why not arrive early to growth stocks.

This is just my opinion, and I’m totally open to being wrong. I’d love to hear other peoples thoughts on this.",06-13-2022
"Why is the jobs report painting a booming job market even with so many layoffs and CEOs like Elon Musk saying we’re probably in a recession?Trying to understand the numbers coming out and the US economy.

"The Rise and Fall of Wall Street’s Most Controversial InvestorAround the middle of April, Cathie Wood sat onstage at the storied Fontainebleau hotel in Miami. It was an awkward time to be a keynote speaker at a conference for money managers: Wood’s flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF, had lost roughly half of its value over the prior year, as its aggressive bets on hot companies from Coinbase to Robinhood and Tesla had melted down amid a bear market in tech stocks.

So far, she’s been wrong — her main fund is down another 34 percent since her comments — but her firm still has more than $16 billion in assets, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. 

Still, over a period of years, stocks do tend to go up. But even if the tide eventually turns back in Wood’s favor, other investors are questioning whether the self-styled futurist has a future in stock-picking, given the volatility that has become her hallmark. After all, Wood, what some call a “permabull,” could be merely the epitome of the broken-clock parable — guaranteed to be right twice a day.

"Views on hold or sell for house purchase in OctoberHi folks, not looking for financial advice, just taking the temperature of the collective view of this group. 

Have part of my house deposit held in a stocks and shares LISA (UK instrument to get you additional gov funds which can be used to purchase first home). Was planning to cash out over the summer, currently holds 15k, and value is obviously dropping atm, and I made a small but lucky investment in TESLA 6 years ago that paid off big time- so unintentional major holding is TESLA. For info the rest of my house deposit is in premium bonds, so very safe. 

I don't want to panic sell the stocks and shares element, and had I not bought a house and needed this cash for part of the deposit would just ride it out. 

So what are the views, cash in now with 3-5k losses, or wait 6 months in hope there would be some recovery, but risk longer term losses if we enter full bear market?

"Supply chain shock will likely get slightly worse before it gets betterAs Shanghai lockdown goes into its end, we would expect supply bottlenecks ease a little bit. But the short term shock is still to be felt. The largest increase in CPI is most likely March as oil jumps. But the largest increase in PPI might still be ahead of us as the shock unravels. 

As an example, major car companies will likely have to halt production for a short period of time after parts run out (before they got replenished). Tesla is experiencing that in Shanghai. Smaller companies might be able to secure some parts but the productivity will likely but adversely affected.

What does this mean for stocks?

1. Earnings will be ugly for companies that are more reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts to conduct normal production. So expect delays for companies that does complicated manufacturing. If they resort to increasing prices, their sales will be down. Not an easy way out for Q2 earnings.

2. PPI will likely get a shock to the upside, leading to more persistent inflation and likely giving fed more reasons to not stop rate hikes. I would say another 50 basis points on top of the scheduled three 50 basis points. Then afterwards few 25s.

3. The market might react adversely to the PPI news, or at least very sensitive to it. Expect soaring VIX before CPI/PPI releases for June and July.

The good news is that, after June and July, mostly at the second half of this year
1. China comes out of the lockdown and begin normal production again, supply chain will likely improve during the later half of the year. Freight costs will go down. Inflation will edge downward as well.
2. Some domestic measures such as  gas tax reduction or tariff reduction, we will see inflation drop as well.

The market will likely react positively to these news as supply eases to meet the demand.

Just to note that another uncertainty comes from the Ukraine crisis. If European countries are all hell bent on getting off Russia oil, their economy will be wrecked. I hope that cooler heads prevail and every stakeholders, Ukraine, Russia, the US, Europe and China can work together to come to a peaceful resolution.

"The Case for Optimism: Time to be greedy when others are fearfulAs of May 6th, the S&P 500 is down \~14% while the Nasdaq is down \~25%. Americans are extremely pessimistic about the economy, with \~75% expecting the economy to worsen. Inflation concerns dominate the list of worries, with CPI in March 2022 coming in at a blistering 8.5%, the highest in 4 decades. The Fed has embarked on what appears to be the first of several 50 bps rate increases to cool inflation, in the hopes of engineering a ""soft landing"". On the geopolitical front, the tragic war in Ukraine rages on while China continues a ""zero covid"" policy with draconian lockdowns in Shanghai. 

However, my personal belief is that investors are missing the forest for the trees. While the stock market will likely remain volatile in 2022, I believe we can expect a return to a bull market driven by a healthy and sustainable US expansion. I personally will be investing an unexpected windfall into the market over the next month. Below is a short list of my reasons, but I'd love to spark a discussion!

Note: all of these statistics, unless otherwise noted, apply to the US stock market / economy. However I am similarly bullish on other developed market economies (Japan, EU, etc.) given their attractive valuations. 

**Rationale:**

1. Strength of the underlying US economy
   1. The US added \~428,000 jobs in April across a broad array of industries led by, importantly, leisure & hospitality + manufacturing, with a \~5.5% year over year increase in wages
   2. Consumers are estimated to have accumulated \~$2.7 trillion in excess savings over the pandemic
   3. A key point often overlooked is that Americans have gained at least $6 trillion (!) in real estate equity, and that figure excludes rental properties. More importantly, while stock ownership is heavily concentrated (the top \~10% richest US households own 90% of stocks) real estate holdings are distributed **relatively** more equally 
   4. The bottom line is that while inflation and the recent market correction is painful, American households (notably wealthier households) have ample resources to drive consumption
2. Corporate refinancings / corporate profits
   1. Corporations took advantage of the 2020 / 2021 drop in interest rates to issue record setting levels of cheap debt, \~$2.28 Trillion in 2020 and \~$3 trillion in 2021. The average corporate interest rate stands at 3.6%, which means corporations have both extended their debt maturities and reduced their interest expenses 
   2. Corporate profits are at record levels, in 2021, at \~$2.8 trillion
   3. Corporates are also sitting on mountains of cash, with \~$2.7 Trillion in cash or short term maturities
   4. Goldman Sachs estimates a record $1 trillion in share buybacks in 2022, a 12% increase over 2021. In the first 2 months of 2022 corporates have already authorized $238 billion in buybacks
   5. In some ways, the economic uncertainty may actually benefit investors. Companies may turn towards buybacks in lieu of investing in riskier projects (as seen in 2012 - 2015) 
3. Key Inflation drivers moderating 
   1. While the headline inflation is unarguably worrying, it's important to focus on what is driving inflation
   2. Much of the most recent increase in March headline inflation was driven by the spike in energy prices: gas, fuel oil, airline fares, electricity, etc. Another substantial portion was driven by the ongoing shortage of used / new cars due to the semiconductor shortage
   3. Perhaps more importantly, the ""comps"" used to calculate year over year inflation provide a natural tailwind as inflation began to accelerate in Q2 2021 
   4. One area of concern going forward is how much inflation we see due to shelter increases, which is just now starting to show up in the data (\~4.5% in March 2022). It's worth keeping in mind that rent is not directly measured by the CPI, only ""owners equivalent rent""
   5. The other wildcard is wage inflation leading to a ""wage price spiral"". I certainly acknowledge it's a risk, but it's worth keeping in mind that the US labor force is still down 1.2 million pre-pandemic levels (and that excludes the natural growth of the labor force for \~2 years). Another note is that the share of the economy going to labor has, surprisingly, declined. 
   6. I suspect we will continue to draw more workers into the economy as pandemic fears continue to recede, child care becomes more stable, and higher wages lure back ""retired"" workers. I also think much of the recent wage inflation is a one-off step-up to a de facto ""minimum wage"" increase to $15 driven by social pressure and a recalculation of the benefits of retention by large corporate employers. 
4. Medium term resolution of key global issues 
   1. I have no military background, so I'll avoid speculating on the tragic invasion of Ukraine by Russia. My only comment is that the consensus view, after wildly overestimating Russian's military prowess, seems to be that Russian military power is rapidly eroding. The pivot from Kyiv to the Donbas region seems to suggest more limited Russian objectives. From a strictly economic point of view, leaving aside the vast human cost and misery, my view is that the bad news is ""priced in"" and that further developments are likely to the upside (negotiations between Ukraine / Russia, more limited official objectives from Putin, etc.) 
   2. In a similar vein China's zero covid policy and draconian lockdown has both lowered Chinese GDP and snarled further supply chain issues. Again, my only opinion here is that the bad news is ""priced in"". If we look forward, it's likely that either China will successfully control the Covid outbreaks or, alternatively, will join the rest of the world in a mitigation strategy after the 20th Annual Party Congress when President Xi feels more secure. 
5. Extreme pessimism 
   1. 53% of investors in the AII survey indicate they are bearish, 20% higher than historical averages. Likewise consumer surveys also indicate significant pessimism 
   2. I personally think the recent sell-off is far too broad based, and has affected healthy, relatively inflation resistant equity sectors (e.g. financials, CPG, etc.) 
6. Painful, but healthy, tech stock reset 
   1. Somewhere around 25% of the market cap of the S&P 500 is the ""FAANG"" stocks (although now Microsoft & Tesla instead of Netflix). The US tech sector is suffering from 2 distinct, but intertwined phenomena. 
   2. The first is that ""trees don't grow to the sky"". Netflix & Meta (Facebook), for example, are naturally reaching limits to their breakneck growth as they already dominate their respective, maturing industries. Likewise Amazon and other e-commerce / digitalization companies are showing sharply slower growth as demand was pulled forward and intensified by the pandemic. As their growth naturally slows, we can expect investors to start valuing them more as mature, profitable enterprises (e.g. Meta now trades at a PE of 16, not far off from JP Morgan at a PE of \~10) 
   3. The second is that investors have basically been pattern matching every ""tech"" company to Alphabet (Google), Meta, etc. True tech companies are defined by network effects, i.e. the marginal cost of serving the next customer trends towards zero. Now some companies only have partial network effects, e.g. Apple drives most of its revenue from hardware, but that hardware ecosystem drives massive network effects with its App store. But other companies are clearly not this pattern, e.g. Palantir relies heavily on professional services (often labeled as ""sales & marketing expenses"") to secure its next customer. 
   4. Low interest rates also drove immense interest in Venture Capital, with new players like Tiger Global (who raised an additional $11B in Feb 2022) deploying billions into startups. Many of the ""mega fundraising rounds"" of late 2020 - early 2022 drove unrealistic valuations. E.g. Bolt, a fintech, raised $355M at an $11B valuation with revenues of \~$40M. Fast, another Fintech, raised a $102M series B round with revenues of low six figures. 
   5. The bottom line is we are seeing a healthy, if potentially overreactive, correction to growth stocks. The next year will likely be painful for late stage startups, particularly those who are not cash flow positive. I suspect we will start to hear layoff announcements at these startups and a slowdown in hiring at the large tech companies (e.g. Meta just repoted a hiring freeze)

**Conclusion**:

As an interesting historical parallel, inflation spiked heavily in the US in 1946-1948 after WW2. I suspect  that much of that inflation was driven by a large increase in consumer spending demand and constrained supply due to a lag in the economy returning to a normal, civilian oriented approach.  

I think the current US economy is also in a current state of transition. While the markets will likely remain volatile for some time, I personally believe inflation has already peaked. Over the next year companies will deploy this massive cash reserves in share buybacks. Consumers, particularly the affluent, will leverage both their accumulated savings and vast increase in real estate equity to drive consumption. Hopefully workers will continue to see pay raises, which with inflation moderating, will turn into **real** wage gains.

"Musk wants to ""show off"" by taking over Twitter: revenues quadruple to $26.4 billion in six yearsAccording to Musk's plan, Twitter's advertising revenue share will be about 90% in 2020, and he wants to reduce that share to 45% in the future. 2028 will see Twitter's annual advertising revenue reach $12 billion and paid subscription revenue reach $10 billion. Other revenues will come from businesses such as data licensing.

　　In addition, Twitter will earn $15 million in revenue from its payments business by 2023, which will grow to about $1.3 billion by 2028. Today, the company's payments business (which includes tipping and shopping) is almost negligible.

　　There is speculation that Musk may introduce payments for Twitter, given that he helped popularize the digital payment service PayPal.

With all these changes, Musk expects he could raise Twitter's average revenue per user (a key metric for social media companies) from $24.83 last year to $30.22 in 2028, an increase of $5.39, according to the plan.

"I could use some advice on where to invest my money in? Student edition.Hello everybody!

"Musk sells $4 billion in Tesla stock, probably to help finance his Twitter deal>Elon Musk has sold 4.4 million shares of Tesla stock worth roughly $4 billion, most likely to help fund his purchase of Twitter.

>Musk reported the sale in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The shares were sold over the past few days, at prices ranging from $872.02 to $999.13.

>The world's richest man, who is the CEO of Tesla, tweeted that he doesn't plan any further sales of the company's shares. He still owns just over 168 million shares in the electric carmaker, via a trust, Agence France-Presse points out.

>Most of the sales took place on Tuesday, when Tesla shares closed down 12%, a huge single-day drop.

>Analysts said Tesla investors fear Musk will be distracted by Twitter and less engaged in running the electric car company. Twitter agreed to be acquired by Musk on Monday for $44 billion.

"Portfolio/modelling advice: I want to replicate New Age Alphas H factor algorithm which back solve growth expectations implied by current share prices. Over what time horizon should growth implied by share prices be measured? Can this be standardised to compare growth expectations across companies?I wondered if  anyone could assist. I am trying to build a portfolio that assesses the growth rate implied by company share prices. 

The criteria for inclusion/exclusion of a company is based on whether the implied growth seems too high relative to historical growth. If this is the case then this company would be marked down and those with more achievable growth rates would be marked up. This is essentially  the same as the F factor method proposed by New Age Alpha  [New Age Alpha Hedge Fund (newagealphahf.com)](https://www.newagealphahf.com/) (Refer to the quote at the bottom which outlines their strategy at a high level)  


Firstly, I love this investment thesis and hence want to replicate it. My issue however is that each company likely has a different time horizon for growth. So how are New Age Alpha controlling for this? Do they look one year ahead, four years ahead, or some other number of years?

To take Tesla as a stylised example: revenue growth was 70% in 2021 and has been 50% on average since 2017. 

I built a hypothetical DCF that solves to the current share price of $916 per share. My model uses 3 stages of growth ( 3 years of constant high growth \[at the most recent growth rate\] followed by a 6 year declining growth period to finally, a terminal value which uses 2% inflationary growth). This isn't necessarily my opinion of Tesla growth trajectory but serves as an example for now.

The model tells me that the revenue growth priced into the Tesla share price is 70% growth for 3 years, followed by a linear decline to inflationary growth. This amounts to a 9 year horizon.

I would then determine statistically - based on the last 4 years of Tesla growth, do I think this is achievable? If yes, then I would give Tesla a high number and keep Tesla in my portfolio as I think the share price adequately reflects what the company is expected to achieve.

The issue is, I chose this growth trajectory at random. Should I be standardising the time horizon across companies to compare them? If I chose a much shorter time horizon then Tesla would need to exhibit higher growth, and vice versa, if I chose a longer time horizon then they would need lower growth to justify the share price.

Curious how the guys at New Age Alpha are dealing with this but their website isn't very helpful. 

New Age Alpha Prospectus states as follows:

 ""The H-Factor algorithm measures how human biases affect stock prices and calculates and assigns H-Factor Scores to each component of the S&P 500® Index. Using a probability-based approach, the algorithm determines the probability that the company will not deliver growth to support its stock price. The algorithm compares the company’s implied revenue growth rate, which is calculated by using the company’s stock price, current and historical financial statements, market data, and other publicly available financial information, such as the company’s revenue, against the company’s historical revenue growth rates to determine how likely the company is to deliver the growth in revenue implied by its stock price. The algorithm is capable of utilizing inputs from different valuation models, such as revenue, cash flow, multiples, comparable, and earnings-based models. Under the algorithm methodology, a high H-Factor Score means that a stock is relatively overpriced and has a higher probability of not delivering growth to support the stock price (*i.e.,* according to the methodology, the stock is a loser). Conversely, a low H-Factor Score means that, according to the methodology, a stock is relatively underpriced and has a lower probability of not delivering growth to support the stock price.""

TLDR: Over what time horizon should growth implied by share prices be measured? Can this be standardised to compare growth expectations across companies?",04-27-2022

"What investment advice would you give to an immortal being?First of all, as a declaimer I must make this very clear. I have NOT split my soul into 7 pieces. There is NOT a portrait of me in the attic that keeps getting older and older. I have NOT kidnaped a princess with magical hair. And I have NOT been bitten by a vampire. This is just a question in general and I am not asking for personal advice for myself.

Anyway .....

I know if my time horizon is short, say I am buying a house soon or I am near to retirement, I should not be messing around with stocks because the year-to-year has too much volatility. If my time span was longer then stocks would be a good idea because I would have time to even out any one year variance. But what if my time horizon was REAL long? Investing in a business would seem as if it would switch back to being a bad idea once more. I cant imagine a business that would still be around 1 000 years into the future. No. Not even Tesla.

So if stocks are out of the picture, the next thing I thought of was gold. Bear markets in stocks can last decades but if your start when you are young then you could just wait out a bear market. Likewise, bear markets in gold can last centuries, but an immortal could just wait out these bear markets in a similar manner. But I am a history buff and I know that gold as an investment is a relatively new idea. Lots of cavillations did value gold, but they valued it as a status symbol rather than as an investment. Like a Lambo or a Rolex. You don't 'invest' in a Lambo. You buy it to show off how rich you are and rub it in the noses of all your haters. Kings and emperors had gold to gloat, not to invest.

My guess is the best option would be real estate. Even when you go back a thousand years, the land owners were the rulign class. It has a proven track record over the needed span of time. Buy a house and the neighborhood turns to shit, and a human would never be able to wait out the bear market for the neighborhood to come back. But an immortal  could just depend on invadable population growth and know that cities will always expand.

Is there any other suggestions? Or things I am missing?",04-21-2022

"Twitter board adopts ‘poison pill’ after Musk’s $43 billion bid to buy company**Note:** The term poison pill refers to a defense strategy used by a target firm to prevent or discourage a potential hostile takeover by an acquiring company. Potential targets use this tactic in order to make them look less attractive to the potential acquirer: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poisonpill.asp

**Article:**

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/15/twitter-board-adopts-poison-pill-after-musks-43-billion-offer-to-buy-company.html

Twitter adopted a limited duration shareholder rights plan, often called a “poison pill,” a day after billionaire Elon Musk offered to buy the company for $43 billion, the company announced Friday.

The board voted unanimously to adopt the plan.

Under the new structure, if any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of at least 15% of Twitter’s outstanding common stock without the board’s approval, other shareholders will be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount.

The plan is set to expire on April 14, 2023.

Such a move is a common way to fend off a potential hostile takeover by diluting the stake of the entity eying the takeover.

“The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,” the company said in a press release.

Twitter noted that the rights plan would not prevent the board from accepting an acquisition offer if the board deems it in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.

Musk already owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter as revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week. Soon after his stake became public, Twitter’s CEO announced plans for Musk to join the board. But days later, Musk reversed course and decided not to join the board after all.

If he had joined, Musk would not be allowed to accumulate more than 14.9% of beneficial ownership of the company’s outstanding common stock.

Also on Friday, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources, that Twitter brought on JPMorgan to help respond to Musk’s bid. Twitter had already been working with Goldman Sachs and Musk has been working with Morgan Stanley.

Several outlets including The New York Post reported Twitter was also fielding interest from Thoma Bravo, though it’s still uncertain a bid will materialize, according to sources who spoke to Reuters.

JPMorgan has history with Musk, suing Tesla over a matter related to his 2018 tweet claiming he had “funding secured” to take the company private. Tesla later countersued the bank.

JPMorgan, Twitter and Thoma Bravo declined comment.

In a live-streamed interview at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver on Thursday, Musk laid out his vision for making Twitter’s algorithms more publicly accessible and limiting content moderation.

He also acknowledged he’s “not sure” if he’ll actually be able to buy Twitter, though he said he does have “sufficient assets” to fund the deal if accepted. Despite his fortune, Musk has much of his assets tied up in equity in his companies including Tesla, meaning he’d likely have to liquidate or borrow against his assets to come up with a large sum.

But Musk said “there is” a Plan B if his initial offer to buy the company and take it private, which he called his “best and final,” is rejected. He declined to provide further details in the TED interview.

On Friday, Twitter’s former CEO and current board member Jack Dorsey tweeted that “the real issue” is that “as a public company, twitter has always been ‘for sale.’”",04-15-2022

"Hertz to buy up to 65,000 electric vehicles from PolestarWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Rental car firm Hertz Global Holdings said on Monday it would buy up to 65,000 electric vehicles over five years from Swedish EV maker Polestar, the latest move by the rental car firm to add zero-emission models.

Hertz said Polestar cars would be available beginning this spring in Europe and later in 2022 in North America and Australia.

The Florida-based rental car company said that it would initially order the Polestar 2 sedan. Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.

Hertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.

In March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.

Polestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.

The Hertz partnership ""will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,"" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.

"Amazon vs. Tesla - what are your thoughts? Over the past 5 quarters, Amazon’s operating income has been getting decimated by inflation. The share price has been range bound for the past two years. Meanwhile, Tesla’s operating income has exploded. They’ve been range bound while their PE has compressed from over 1000 down to 180. In other words, through their impeccable execution, they’ve delivered unbelievable margins while continuing to scale. Amazon and Tesla are two companies that have been range bound for roughly the same duration. That sometimes means they’re about to make a swing in either direction. I’d put a spread trade on the two (Tesla up and amazon down) for the following reason: Tesla’s operating income has exploded sequentially for the past 5 quarters while amazons has done the exact opposite. I also think amazon is going to take a -$9 eps hit in Q1 driven by rivian and continued operating expense inflation. In Q1 ‘21 amazon hit $16 eps. That means their PE ratio is set to sky rocket with limited upside growth on top line revenue. Tesla on the other hand is just starting this journey. They built the infrastructure during a period pre-inflation and are flooded with cash. In an inflationary environment, you want/need improving margins. Tesla is delivering on that while Amazon is not.",03-25-2022

With this development and others like point towards investing in North American sourced lithium IMO. 

One such company Lithium bank (which has lithium assets in Canada) is expected to IPO on the TSXV under the symbol $LBNK.V.

$LBNK's flagship project Sturgeon Lake is located near Edmonton making it very accessible. 

This project has an estimated 5.97M tonnes LCE, an average LI concentration of 67.1 mg/l and a total elemental Li recourse of 1.12M tonnes. 

Considering that Canada does not have many domestically-sourced lithium companies that are public, I think $LBNK's IPO poses a unique investment opportunity

"New Investment Strategy - Brainstorm PartyHey everyone, was hoping to see if I could get some opinions on a potential new (at least new for me) strategy. I’ve been very modestly investing in individual companies with the super majority of my funds going straight into either the SP500 (FXAIX – Fidelity’s index fund) and Nasdaq (QQQ).

I’ve been reading how diversification can help lower overall risk but can also impact portfolio growth. My goal is NOT to buy $2000 Tesla calls or $250 Amazon leaps for a potential post-stock-split-surge or anything like that (and quite honestly, I barely have touched contracts so just bear with me if that verbiage is off lol). It also seems like doing the “*classic*” “100 minus your age” formula for stock to bonds ratio seems extreme, as I’m 29 years old having my portfolio and 29% bonds seems ridiculous – ***to me*** (debating this is not so much my hope for in this post lol). I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to get over the fact that the [Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VBTLX:MUTF?window=MAX) has had a 2.54% increase since November 16, 2001 granting about a 0.12% increase per year, on average, over the last 21 years – not inflation adjusted.

# Goal

To find some type of happy medium between spending all day researching stocks (which I enjoy – but not sure how sustainable that is long term as I do data analysis full time and someday, in the next 3-5 years, will hopefully have kiddos to look after) and over-diversification which *could* prevent portfolio growth (....*and is a little boring*).

# Disclaimers before continuing:

**1.**  I know that adding bonds to your portfolio hedges against risk but as I’m still (very slightly) part Ape..I just really don’t care about taking a big hit – AS LONG AS I KNOW I’m invested in good companies that will (also understand this isn't guaranteed) bounce back over the next 30 years.  
**2.** I know that SP500 is roughly 500 companies and that QQQ is even less at about 100. Which you could easily argue is pretty concentrated. My argument against this is that there are a handful of companies that I personally don’t like as much (some from moral standpoints, some just purely uninterested and would rather have my money invested elsewhere) and that with the top 10 companies (really the top 9 since Google is always split into Class A and Class C for some reason in these holdings) they generally make up 30% of the entire allocation (at least in the SP500). So if I’m okay with a *little* more risk (hoping for a little more growth) why not purely invest in those?

# Alright – to the potential strategy part..

My thought is that I could pull the holdings of SP500 ([FXAIX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/315911750) for this example – [here is the full list of holdings](https://www.actionsxchangerepository.fidelity.com/ShowDocument/ComplianceEnvelope.htm?_fax=-18%2342%23-61%23-110%23114%2378%23117%2320%23-1%2396%2339%23-62%23-21%2386%23-100%2337%2316%2335%23-68%2391%23-66%2354%23103%23-16%2369%23-30%2358%23-20%2376%23-84%23-11%23-87%230%23-50%23-20%23-92%23-98%23-116%23-28%2358%23-38%23-43%23-39%23-42%23-96%23-88%2388%23-45%23-32%23-112%23-4%23-65%23-3%2375%23102%23-104%23-74%235%23-89%23-105%23-67%23126%2377%23-126%23100%2345%23-44%23-73%23-15%238%23-21%23-37%23-17%23-14%23-98%23123%23-18%2345%23-59%23-82%2367%2383%23112%2317%2370%23-78%2378%23-50%2336%23-86%23-90%2381%23-21%23-119%23-30%23120%2349%2328%23-98%2333%2351%23-78%23-119%23-16%2350%23-58%2350%23102%2348%23-17%2352%23-99%23), you may need to click “Monthly Holdings Report” tab on that link if you’re not directed there). Then get the top 10 companies (you could change this to top 5, top 20, 30, etc. – whatever you’d feel comfortable with, obviously the more you add, the more diversification, the less risk, and the closer to SP500 performance you’d be).

In this example, we’ll take the top 11 holdings (since Google is split into two – we’ll combine that leaving us with top 10 companies). Grab the allocation percentage for each, add those up, then divide the allocation percent by the sum to get it based on 100%. Calculation walkthrough:

**1.** Apple is currently #1 at 7.098%  
**2.** If you add the top 11 holdings you get 30.028%  
**3.** 7.098/30.028 = 23.638%. This would be the allocation in our portfolio for Apple

**Test Portfolio Allocation**:

|Company|Our Test Portfolio Allocation|SP500(FXAIX) Allocation 3/2022|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Apple (AAPL)|23.64%|7.10%|

Here is a [screenshot of the portfolio allocations and calculations](https://imgur.com/a/Iimxz2q).

# Backtesting

Before I’d want to implement this strategy, I’d want to try to back test it and compare it to SP500 performance. This is just difficult because the *holdings change over time*. I can’t take the holdings of the SP500 today and compare it over the last 20 or 30 years because they were not allocated similarly back in 2000 or 1990. Similarly, it’s surprisingly difficult trying to find something along the lines of historical, monthly holdings (or even historical, annual holdings) for these index funds/ETFs.

In an attempt to use the current holdings, I created a portfolio test comparing the new strategy to FXAIX from *1/1/2021 to today* and it looks like we have pretty good results. I know this is an extremely short time range but at least it’s something.

Here's a [screenshot to the portfolio test](https://imgur.com/a/Y1K00z8). The highlighted portion is for argument #1 below.

# The two main arguments I could see going against this strategy is:

**1.** If the top 10 companies underperform the rest of the SP500 then, because you’re not as diversified you could have a larger loss. And yes, while I’d agree with that, I'd also add if the top 10 are going down, the whole thing is more than likely going down – while FXAIX may drop less than our test portfolio (like we see highlighted in 9/2021 to 10/2021 in the [portfolio test screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Y1K00z8)), having a more concentrated portfolio in these top companies, I believe, long term, may give better results while also giving you a steady strategy to keep your eyes on for the future.  
**2.** You can have companies go bankrupt (like General Electric, Sears, etc.), how do you account for this? Those companies don’t just fall off the face of the earth, we saw a decline in their holdings percentage as they lost market cap - to be honest, I don't know exactly how quickly they fell from their places in the top 10 since finding that historical information is a little bit of a pain and this was before I really followed the markets. However, this loss in market cap would be reflected in our portfolio as well. Because of taxes, I don’t know if you’d want to rebalance monthly or what the best cadence would be – but I think rebalancing either quarterly or semi-annually would be okay. Also note, if Apple (or any one of those top 10 companies) were to...say double their debt while losing like 50% of cash flow or something, I’d bet just about anything we’d see headlines all over the place – so yes, it may be beneficial to keep some type of finger on the pulse of the market but it’d be much more hands-off than reading 10-Ks/doing fundamental research and technical analysis.

&#x200B;

This strategy seems like it lets you invest in the greatest companies in the world and be more concentrated in those companies, while also taking the emotional aspect out of the game. Wanted to know everyone’s thoughts on this and see if we can poke any holes! Thanks all!",03-24-2022

"V2G Tech Bridging The Gap Between EV and Diesel Cost In an Untapped MarketFull disclosure: I retained a small position in $PTRA in my Roth IRA. Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor. Do your own DD as always.

I want to start a discussion on **V2G** as I think it has reached the turning point in commercialization of V2G tech and its unique but perfect marriage with electric school bus.

&#x200B;

**What is V2G:**

V2G or Vehicle-to-Grid is using electric vehicle specially equipped with bidirectional charging to take energy from the grid when the cost is low such as overnight and selling the energy back to the grid during peak hours when the electric cost is highest. It is important that the EV has a lot of energy left, ie: short routes and mostly unused hours/days. School buses have short routes, spend most of the day not in use and have many months without service particularly in the Summer assuming 180 days in a typical school year. Most electric vehicles can't do V2G. For example, not only my Tesla can't do bidirectional charging due to limitation, even if it could there just isn't enough 'juice' left to sell back to the grid at the end of the day because of high mileage.

&#x200B;

**Successful use of V2G in commercial settings:**

Thomas Built Buses just announced a [long term agreement](https://electrek.co/2022/03/18/electric-school-buses-are-reaching-cost-parity-with-diesel-and-a-california-district-will-deploy-one-of-the-largest-e-bus-fleets-in-the-state/) to 2025 with Highland Electric to sell a fleet of the electric bus Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley powered by Proterra's 226kWh battery and drivetrain. The 226kWh battery is the largest in the industry for school buses and has the capacity that is more than 16 times that of a Tesla Powerwall battery. This agreement is expanding on their previous fleet order of 326 electric bus in February of 2021 after Highland spent the past year successfully confirming that it is profitable using V2G on the Jouley electric school bus. [Highland estimated that a single bus generated roughly $10,000 for the company over the course of the summer](https://environmentnorthcarolinacenter.org/sites/environment/files/reports/NC_V2G%202022%20scrn.pdf#NC_V2G%202022.indd%3A11654) performing V2G. Highland will finance the purchase of the electric bus fleet, charge the Jouley bus overnight when cost is cheapest, [have the school districts pay on subscriptions for just the miles driven](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/03/21/sbaas-model-brings-electric-school-buses-to-more-districts/), then sell the leftover energy back to the grid during peak hours when the cost is highest. Highland would take care of all maintenance and charging infrastructure. Highland Electric is a company that was created for the sole purpose of commercializing V2G in electric school buses. It's doing this for profit. The result came back so promising that it resulted in them opening their order book for more.

&#x200B;

**Why is this important:**

Having a working business model where it is profitable to buy an electric school bus vs diesel is a game changer. An electric school bus is no longer viewed as just a novelty transport but as a stack of 16 Tesla Powerwalls that just happen to also earn transport income. Cost has always been the biggest hurdle in transitioning from 480,000 diesel school buses to electric. Electric school bus is often priced $120,000-$200,000 higher than its comparable diesel school bus. I'm fully aware of the few billions in funding for new electric school buses in a use-it-or-lose-it mandate and the touted $10,000 or so per year savings on fuel and maintenance. But unless the upfront cost comes down to the same level as diesel, I don't see many of those diesel getting phased out to electric. Having companies like Highland Electric take on the upfront cost and the associated long term risk would get transition to electric sped up and on a massive scale. The fact that Highland found long term, V2G not only make up the difference in $120,000-$200,000 cost difference but actually turning a profit from it is extremely intriguing. Now, for the same amount of money, school districts can get 3 electric school buses instead of 1 by having Highland maximizing the full potential of these powerful batteries instead of having them waste away in the parking lot in down time.

&#x200B;

**More companies want in on V2G:**

Aside from Thomas Built Buses long-term partnership using Proterra's 226kWH battery and drivetrain with Highland Electric, a number of other companies are taking advantage of the working V2G & electric school bus model.

\- Dominion Energy selected Thomas Built's Jouley electric bus with its 226 kWh Proterra battery for V2G ([source](https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10133648/bus-electrification-partnership-to-drive-cost-savings-cleaner-air)). Dominion plans to add 200 buses per years for the next 5 years.

\- On a smaller scale, Alaskan Energy and DTE Energy both selected the Jouley electric bus to study and obtain their own data on V2G.

\- Blue Bird will provide Nuvve with electric school bus equipped with 155 kWh battery ([source](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/20/nuvve-and-blue-bird-combine-to-create-electric-school-buses-that-are-v2g-enabled/))

\- BYD just released a small electric school bus with 150 kWh battery with V2G tech but no partners yet([source](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a38952770/byd-electric-school-bus-v2g-charging/)). BYD might have a difficult time getting partners as BYD is being blacklisted by US government from using tax money.

Most updated list of Utility V2G pilot programs (3/14/22): [link](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/3-design-considerations-electric-school-bus-vehicle-grid-programs)

&#x200B;

**Minimal battery degradation from V2G over 10 years:**

""In the case of frequency regulation and peak load shaving V2G grid services offered 2 hours each day, battery wear remains minimal even if this grid service is offered every day over the vehicle lifetime.""

""Frequency regulation and peak load shaving at power rates typical for vehicle charging and discharging will not significantly accelerate battery degradation in comparison to the degradation incurred from driving and calendar aging. Even in the ”extreme” cases in which we assume all EVs provide grid services from 7:00pm-9:00pm every day for ten years, the capacity losses from frequency regulation and peak load shaving only increase by 3.62% and 5.6%, respectively.""

&#x200B;

**FYI for potential investors:**

\- Proterra (PTRA) produces battery and drivetrain for Thomas Built Buses as well as other heavy-duty commercial companies. Proterra will have its 3rd and massive 327,000 square foot EV battery factory up and running in the 2nd half of 2022. Proterra also builds electric transit buses.

\- Thomas Built Buses is the oldest American bus manufacturer and is owned by Daimler. Daimler Truck is an investor in Proterra.

\- Lion Electric (LEV) is a Canadian company and it builds electric school buses among other large commercial vehicles.  Lion Electric will have its new $70 million US manufacturing plant completed late 2022.

\- Nuvve (NVVE) specializes in V2G platform and is more of an EV charging company.

The size of the pie(480,000) is so large that no single company can eat it all. Even if everyone gets just 1% of that pie or 4,800 school buses, at [$500/kWh](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-12-03977/article_deploy/sustainability-12-03977.pdf) average price for battery and a 226 kWH battery, a company like Proterra would be looking at revenue of $542M for the battery alone. Proterra already [locked up](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/proterra-lg-partner-on-ev-battery-cells/) a stable supply of high-grade Nickel battery cells with LG Energy Solution through 2028.

&#x200B;

To conclude, I believe the fact that our electricity infrastructure being far from perfect is what makes V2G profitable. I'm excited at the potential of V2G opening the door to a massive and untapped market of electrification of 480,000 school buses.",03-23-2022

The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)

&#x200B;

The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.

&#x200B;

It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.

&#x200B;

The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.

&#x200B;

Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.

&#x200B;

Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.

&#x200B;

Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.

&#x200B;

The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.

&#x200B;

SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.

&#x200B;

Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.

&#x200B;

See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?

&#x200B;

Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:

&#x200B;

The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",12-27-2023

I can afford to not sell the position because I’m bullish long term on Tesla and I don’t need this money now, but man it hurts watching it just go deeper and deeper.

B - sell short dated covered calls (monthlies) with a few strikes above current market since the $280C are pretty much worthless right now. But if the stock turns around in the short term, then I could be totally screwed.

"P/E ratio for growth stocksShould you use the median P/E ratio (last 5years) of growth stocks to value them? I know that P/E ratio above 30- 35 are difficult to keep over long period of times, but many growth stocks have median P/E ratios than exceed 35 by a lot. So it's ok to suppose that a growth stock will match its median P/E ratio again or should I use a lower p/ e ratio for the estimates(maybe the median P/E ratio for companies in the same industry? )
In general, how long can growth stocks keep a high P/E ratio?
As an example I have Tesla. Right now is P/E ratio is 68. And its median P/E ratio last years was 179. So will Tesla have a similar P/E (especially if they grow as analyst expect) or which p/ e ratio would you use for the next 3 years at least 

I hope I can be understood, I am still new in investing, but there are some stuff that still confuse me. If you could help me, I would appreciate a lot :)

How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,09-28-2023
Charge pointI initially decided to invest couple of thousand into charge point stock after installing them at work (I am an electrician). Looking up into it they have 300k locations which made me believe that at lest the company somewhat knows what it’s doing (even though it hasn’t been profitable) and won’t go bankrupt and at the point of my investment it was 8 dollars a share which seemed fairly low from the looks of the chart. With Tesla teaming up with other car manufacturers to use their charge stations now the stock just seems to keep going lower and lower. Is it a lost cause or should I DCA. Thanks,09-25-2023

"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming yearSo I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",07-17-2023

&#x200B;

**1)** **Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**

Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.

**2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**

Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.

**3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**

As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.

**4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**

Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.

"What Am I Missing?Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). 

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...

So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?",06-29-2023

"TSLA: Cybertruck’s About to Nuke Boomer AutoAlright degens I've been crunching some numbers that are gonna make you twitch. People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.

I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.

The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.

We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.

I smell blood, and I think you do too.

Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.

Even with that lowball number, Tesla’s got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That’s like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.

Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: 🖕

These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.

So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts’ expectations out of the water.

tl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.

"Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions 

Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.

Nonetheless, it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck’s capabilities.

Preproduction “alpha” versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still “astounded” that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.",06-14-2023

"What's going on with Rivian?Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the company’s share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?

One bright spot has been the company’s increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivian’s future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% increase. Also, Rivian executives stressed their plans for profitability, which sent stock prices soaring. 

However, some larger issues still remain. Rivian is being forced to compete not only with rival Tesla, but other legacy automakers jumping into the EV race such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company. If Rivian doesn’t establish a strong foothold in the electric vehicle market soon, it may lose its opportunity to establish a presence in this growing market. 

I believe Rivian is an all-or-nothing play. Investing in the stock is extremely risky. However, the stock is poised for explosive returns if the company can work out its financial issues and deliver quality products to millions of customers that demand them. Currently, the company sits on $12 billion in cash and just shy of $3 billion in debt. According to FactSet, the target price for Rivian Automotive is $23.95, which reflects positive sentiment for the company even as it struggles.",06-06-2023

The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.

Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.

After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.

**why is this important?**

1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested.
2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology.
4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink.
5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.

"Anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies via asset management companies?Hey lads! I’m sure everyone by now is pretty aware of the AI and robotics space as it’s literally all over the place right now. People like Elon Musk have been talking about it a lot recently and Tesla also just put out their newest iteration of their bots on LinkedIn which was pretty cool to see. I’ve always been amazed at how robots are able to do tasks in the same capacity we do so seeing it come to fruition is pretty insane to me.

I always do my best to keep up with news in the space to see if there’s any cool advancements or new jobs that these robots are taking on. That being said I saw today that “United Drug” who is one of Ireland’s largest pharmaceutical distributors has just brought in a whole squad of autonomous robots..and when I say squad I mean 21 robots lmao. That’s almost enough for a soccer match lol. The company partnered with LocusBots to make this happen which I found pretty cool because I had heard about them working with DHL and UPS before. Apparently these robots are able to navigate autonomously through the warehouse and assist the human staff (thought I’d add the human part on just incase lol) with handling orders. It’s suppose to increase overall productivity of the warehouse, which I feel like is going to be the case when you add in robotics in any capacity to somewhere. I wonder if robots are eventually going to eliminate a whole bunch of jobs in the near future.. What yall think? I feel like i can easily see robots operating a warehouse.

After reading through the article I wanted to check out LocusBots a bunch more and invest in them. Cause if they are making big splashes like this in major companies around the world I want to be in on them. It was annoying to find out that they’re a private company lol

I did however come across Stack Capital while doing my search into investing into Locus. From what I gathered Stack Capital invests in equity, debt, and/or other securities of growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I seen that in their portfolio they had already invested $8m into LocusBots back in 2022 so this could potentially be a good way to indirectly invest in them right? From the looks of it they have a pretty solid management team with a whole bunch of experience so I’m not super worried about their judgement when it comes to portfolio management.

Does anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies this way? I’ve personally never done it so I’m not 100% sure on it. I really love the look of Locus so I would really love to get some insight into companies like Stack and if they’re a good shout or not.",05-30-2023

"4 rental properties & home paid off, no mortgages/loans. 30 years old. What should I invest in with an additional $100k? (Advice Needed)**Hi team.**

**I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.

**My current investments are the following:**

* 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.)
* My home (Paid off).
* 2 Stocks (NIO & Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share.
* My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).

I have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).

My monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).

I know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.

So, I've heard the term ""mutual funds"" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms ""HYSA and Money market funds"". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).

So now, I plan to change how I manage my money.

**What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.

**What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account.
3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF).
4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.

So, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.

**My questions are:**

1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy?
2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.

P.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.

I appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.",05-28-2023

"Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock. 

## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.

The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.

It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.

Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.

Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.

 

## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance

During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:

* Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year;
* Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.

Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.

Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.

While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS). 

 By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.

Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss.  

Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.

 

## Didn't see this coming

Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.

Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile. 

While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business. 

 

## Is the stock a buy?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejok5t214q0b1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=07eb3d2aa3cc50571a3de7cb8c4eb82190d7c22e

 

In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify. 

After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.

Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.

Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.  

I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.",05-19-2023

"Tech giants $ROKU, $TSLA, and $SQ battle it out for the title of best growth stock&#x200B;

 **Roku ($ROKU)**

Roku generates a significant portion of its revenue through advertising and content distribution services on its streaming platform. The company also sells streaming devices. Roku’s revenue grew 1% to $741 million in Q1 2023 and surpassed analysts’ estimates. It reported a lower-than-anticipated loss per share of $1.38, although losses widened considerably compared to $0.19 in the prior-year quarter.    

 

The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined 5% year-over-year to $40.67. The company expects advertising spend to remain under pressure throughout this year due to macro challenges.

## Is Roku a Good Stock to Buy?

Following the Q1 results in late April, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained a Buy rating on Roku stock but lowered his price target to $75 from $85. Explaining his investment stance, the analyst stated that platform revenue has stabilized, with upcoming tailwinds from advertisers, agencies, retail media, and DSP integrations.

Given headwinds from slowing ad spend by subscription video on-demand (SVOD) providers and higher “scatter market exposure,” Helfstein expects Roku to be one of the first beneficiaries of any recovery in the ad market.

Wall Street’s Moderate Buy consensus rating on Roku is based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and three Sells. The average price target of $69.74 implies about 25% upside.

## Tesla ($TSLA)

Investors were unimpressed with Tesla’s first-quarter performance, as the company’s earnings declined due to the impact of price cuts on margins. The company also cited underutilization of new factories, higher raw material, commodity, logistics, and warranty costs, and lower revenue from environmental credits as the reasons for margin contraction.

 

During the Q1 earnings call CEO Elon Musk justified the company’s pricing strategy, saying that a focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet is the “right choice” than lower volumes and higher margins. Musk expects Tesla’s vehicles to generate significant profit over time through its autonomy feature.

Following multiple price cuts, Tesla recently hiked the prices of several cars in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan. Nonetheless, prices remain lower than the levels seen at the start of this year.

 

## Is Tesla a Buy, Hold, or Sell?

Earlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target to $280 from $300 but reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst reduced his 2023-2025 estimates to reflect price cuts and their impact on margins. While Potter agrees with management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, he contends that this won't happen quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.

On the positive side, Potter thinks that the global average selling price (ASP) could fall by \~$125 per unit every quarter for the next two years without hurting margins due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Until margins and other fundamentals start improving, Potter believes that TSLA might struggle to “catch a bid.” Nevertheless, he remains bullish on the stock and expects investors to turn around in the second half of the year and beyond.

 Wall Street’s Moderate Buy consensus rating on Tesla is based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and four Sells. The average price target of $202.15 suggests nearly 20% upside.

## Block ($SQ)

Shares of fintech Block declined sharply in March after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of inflating the number of users on its Cash App system. The company shook off these concerns by reporting better-than-expected Q1 2023 results last week.

Adjusted EPS jumped 122% to $0.40 in Q1 2023, driven by a 26% rise in revenue to about $5 billion and enhanced margins. Results gained from solid momentum in the company’s Cash App peer-to-peer ecosystem. Cash App’s gross profit increased 49% to $931 million. Meanwhile, Square, the company’s ecosystem focused on merchants, delivered a gross profit of $770 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter.

Based on the gross profit momentum in Q1, the company increased its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $1.36 billion from the previous guidance of $1.30 billion.   

## What is the Price Target for SQ Stock?

Following Block’s results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $80 from $95, given the lower market valuations for stocks in the payments space.

 

The analyst highlighted that Q1 results beat expectations because the robust momentum in the Cash App business offset softer seller trends as volumes faded during the quarter. Tandon remains positive on Block based on the company’s focus on driving profitable long-term growth and an expanding product suite as payments continue to shift to digital channels.

With 23 Buys and seven Holds, Square earns Wall Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating. At $91.19, the average price target suggests 58.5% upside.

## Conclusion

Block shares have underperformed Tesla and Roku stocks so far this year. However, analysts are more bullish about Block and see higher upside potential in the stock compared to the other two growth stocks.",05-12-2023

"Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023)THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong.

I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term.

IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more.

Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this):

1. Nvidia

I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks.

2. TSMC

The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B.

What I don't think are great for investment:

1. Google/Alphabet

Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS.

2. Tesla

I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why.

And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",04-29-2023

Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.

0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0% 

With roughly one-third of the S&P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.

Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&P 500 this year.

According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a ""January Effect"" bounce.

The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.

 

Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.

"Buying shares post-split: good or bad idea?Many stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors.

Several companies –  Tesla (TSLA $**TSLA**), Alphabet (GOOGL $**GOOGL**), Palo Alto Networks (PANW $**PANW**), and Shopify (SHOP $**SHOP**) – have all split their shares over the last year.

Tesla reported earnings this week; results came in somewhat mixed, with the company posting a 2.4% EPS beat and a negative 1% sales surprise. The market didn’t appreciate the results, with TSLA shares facing selling pressure post-earnings.

**Alphabet**

The tech titan Alphabet announced a 20-for-1 split in early 2022. Shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 18th, 2022.

Alphabet shares have retraced 3.5% in value post-split so far, again underperforming relative to the general market.

**Palo Alto Networks**

PANW’s three-for-one stock split in mid-September didn’t get much attention. The company’s shares started trading split-adjusted on September 14th, 2022.

Palo Alto Networks shares have been hot throughout 2023, as shown below. Since the split, PANW shares are up 5.7%, marginally outperforming the S&P 500.

Value-focused investors may not find PANW shares attractive, with the company carrying a Style Score of “F” for Value. Presently, PANW’s 8.5X forward price-to-sales ratio resides on the expensive side, above the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average and the 7.5X five-year median.

"Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last yearTesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

Tesla Tumbles 3% in Premarket After Sixth Price Cut this Year - Tokenist,04-19-2023
"Time to buy Tesla ($TSLA) stock before Q1 earnings? 

Tesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this week’s earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.

With shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.

Let’s see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.

**Q1 Preview**

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.

The dip in Tesla’s YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)

While Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company’s earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla’s profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.

Tesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.

With that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share. 

**Deliveries & Demand**  

The ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla’s quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla’s willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022.  

This would still fall short of Wall Street’s estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla’s ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock. 

**Growth & Outlook**

Tesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla’s growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.

According to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter.  

On the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.

**Performance & Valuation**

Tesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&P 500’s +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors’ +4% and Ford’s +9% YTD performance.

Even better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors’ +41%, Ford’s +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry’s +88%. 

Shares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.

**Bottom Line**

Going into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Tesla’s annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.

Although the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be  rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease. ",04-18-2023

"Tesla stock dips as analysts warn price cuts will weigh on margins 

Tesla ($TSLA) shares are moving lower in premarket Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker delivered the fifth series of price cuts since January.

According to the company’s website, Tesla slashed prices on the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively. The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,” the company said in a press release.

The cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the company’s internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.

Tesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.

**What analysts are saying about price cuts**

While Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower prices, analysts warn that the company’s margins could be at risk. The Street sees Tesla reporting a 21.1% auto gross margin for Q1.

Wells Fargo analysts believe Tesla will miss the >20% target for auto gross margins. They also see Tesla reporting lower-than-expected EPS for the first quarter. Moreover, the analysts say Tesla will need to average \~526K deliveries from Q2 to Q4 to hit its 2M target.

“Our estimated auto gross margin ex credits of 18.3% is below guidance of >20% and Visible Alpha (VA) consensus of 21.7%. We forecast ASPs for $46K, also below TSLA's target of >$47K. Our Model 3/ Y pricing is down 12% vs. Q3, below our est. avg. price cut of 14%, reflecting model & trim mix help,” they said in a note.

Citi analysts add that price cuts weren’t surprising and are likely to place a further focus on the Q1 auto gross margin.

“A stronger-than-expected gross margin outcome would support the contention that Tesla’s latest price cuts are coming from a position of cost strength while also possibly reflecting lower input costs. An in-line/softer gross margin outcome could revive concerns over capacity/product aging while placing 2023 consensus estimates at risk since they call for improving gross margins throughout the year,” they wrote in a note.

“At \~46x ‘23 consensus EPS, we don’t think the latter outcome is currently priced-in, making for a less than compelling risk/reward into the quarter under the current macro backdrop. We prefer staying opportunistic.”

Finally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.

“We note that lead times were relatively weak (<4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \*except\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify.""

Given that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don’t believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.

“We maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,” they finally concluded.

"Summary of recent news, and the impact on U.S. stocks **U.S. March nonfarm payrolls data mixed, leaving door open for another Fed rate hike in May**

U.S. nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 236,000 in March, below expectations of 239,000 and the smallest increase since December 2020.

The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, compared with a forecast of 3.6 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast of 0.3%.

With the release of the nonfarm payrolls data, one of the Fed's two most closely watched indicators - employment and inflation - firmed, U.S. bond yields lifted across the board, and the swap agreement showed the Fed's next FOMC meeting in May with another 25 basis point rate hike probability of about 75%.

**Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers: U.S. recession possibility rises, Fed nears end of rate hike**

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers said the Fed is coming to the end of interest rate hikes after a series of weak economic indicators were released and the possibility of a U.S. recession is on the rise. Commenting on the Fed's May rate meeting, Summers said it is clear that we are in the final stages of the current tightening cycle. Whether it is necessary to take action again, I think this is a judgment they should wait until the last minute.

**Hedge funds: the Fed policy is about to turn, the dollar may depreciate 15% in a year and a half**

British hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital released a report saying that the dollar could fall another 10 to 15 percent in the next year and a half as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve is about to ease monetary policy. Stephen Jen, the firm's chief executive, said the Fed may be very close to or may even have crossed the peak of its hawkish stance, and that means a rate cut is coming.

**Bank of America: How OPEC + Production Cuts Impacted April CPI Data**

Bank of America said the impact of the Opec + voluntary production cuts on the economy and monetary policy is likely to be fairly small. That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI component of the April CPI report is likely to decline slightly, as the lagged impact of earlier declines in oil prices outweighed Monday's gains.

**Undeterred by the banking crisis, individual investors in U.S. stocks still plunge into bank stocks**

Despite the ongoing crisis in the U.S. banking sector, the market still has doubts about the outlook for the banking sector and the U.S. economy, but U.S. retail investors continued to plunge into hard-hit bank stocks in the first quarter, pumping money into heavyweight stocks such as U.S. banks. According to data from Vanda Research, net buying of U.S. bank stocks soared to $769 million in the first quarter of this year, surpassing even the buying of retail concepts such as $Nifty ([NFLX.US](https://nflx.us/))$ and $Rivian Automotive ([RIVN.US](https://rivn.us/))$ in the same period. The company said retail investors even bought more than $200 million in shares of troubled $First Republic Bank ([FRC.US](https://frc.us/))$ during the period.

**Price war intensifies! Tesla cuts prices again in the U.S. by up to $5,000 per vehicle**

Tesla's ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ website showed on Thursday that the price of its electric cars in the United States has been reduced once again. And just one month has passed since the last time Tesla cut prices in the United States. The price of both versions of the Model 3 was cut by $1,000, the price of the two existing Model Y models was cut by $2,000, and the Model S and Model X were each cut by $5,000. In addition, Tesla has officially launched a new, less expensive Model Y with AWD powertrain in the U.S., priced at $49,990.

**ExxonMobil reportedly in talks to buy shale oil giant Pioneer Natural Resources**

ExxonMobil ([XOM.US](https://xom.us/))$ has entered into preliminary informal discussions to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources ([PXD.US](https://pxd.us/))$, the top-ranked independent oil producer and shale oil production giant in the United States, media said Friday, April 7, citing sources familiar with the matter.

"Tesla or KBE this week?Just wanting some opinions on my situation. Critique me on my mindset as well, im still very new to this. As title says, I have holdings in KBE and Tesla with some earnings coming for both Tesla and several banks including Citi and JPMorgan. Tesla I’m down 6%, KBE I’m up 0.5%. Should I stay where I’m at? Drop KBE and dump into Tesla? Or Drop Tesla and flood KBE?

Thinking this week will be a tumultuous week for banks and maybe a rebound for Tesla since they’ve been steady on deliveries so I’m leaning toward putting all into Tesla.

*I have diversified into other sectors, these aren’t my only two positions. Just something I’m considering to maybe take advantage.",04-09-2023
Elon Musk’s brother Kimbal dumps $17 million worth of Tesla shares on the market,04-06-2023
"Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule. Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.  

The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.

But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.

Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.

**Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule. 

Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.

Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.

Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.

PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list. 

Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.

## Costco Sales Weak

Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.

## Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.

The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed. 

## Stock Market Rally

The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.

The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.

U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.

The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.

## ETFs

Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.

SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.

## Bank Stocks

The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.

Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.",04-06-2023

# [Stock futures rise as Dow and S&P 500 look to extend 4-day winning streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Tuesday as the market remained resilient even after a spike in oil prices.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 48 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 are coming off their fourth straight day of gains, rising nearly 1% and 0.4% on Monday. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, slipped 0.3%.
*****
> Markets have been resilient of late, with the major averages rising even when faced by persistent inflation, a banking crisis and higher rates.
*****
> This week, the energy market became another potential source of uncertainty, after OPEC+ announced it was slashing output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day. West Texas Intermediate futures had their biggest daily gain in nearly a year on the news. On Tuesday, crude rose another 1%.
*****
> “Given the transition the world is undergoing as it embraces ‘clean and green energy,’ OPEC+ understands all too well that its still highly valued ‘liquid gold’ will at some point begin to lose its shine,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
> “Until then, as the countries dominating OPEC+ prepare for the future by spending trillions of dollars rebuilding infrastructure and refocusing away from crude oil as their primary source of income, managing the price of crude will be used more directly and aggressively than was anticipated,” she added.
*****
> Analysts say the prospect of higher oil prices could stoke inflation and recession fears, but Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said she doesn’t expect markets to price in a recession a second time after the “pretty severe” bear market in 2022. If there is some volatility, it’s more likely to be a “normal” correction of between 5% and 15% that sets the market up for a better second half, she said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “We do think we’re headed toward a period of consolidation, maybe some volatility,” she said, highlighting earnings, market expectations of Fed policy and a slowdown in lending amid the banking crises as three incremental headwinds.
*****
> On Tuesday investors will get the latest number from the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, at 10 a.m. ET.

"Advice on Long-Term Dividend Investing in a Brokerage AccountHi guys, new dividend investing noob here.

I have mostly been involved in investing in growth stocks and ETFs. I max out my 401k and mega-backdoor every year (\~$65k/year) with VTSAX, VOO, and target vanguard retirement funds. I also additionally contribute $20k-30k on the side in a normal brokerage account buying some individual growth stocks I think will be worth in the future (Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Google, Nvidia..., the usual bunch). None of this will change even after I begin investing into dividends.

Due to my income, I cannot contribute to a Roth IRA as I am over the limit, and I already max out all my retirement accounts with the ETFs mentioned above (my employer doesnt even offer dividend ETFs as an option so I can't even do a split here if I wanted to). If I want to begin investing into dividends stocks my only option is to do it via a normal brokerage account.

My plan is to contribute $1k/month to SCHD and continue doing so for the next couple decades (playing the long game here). My goal is to eventually get my monthly dividends to meet my monthly expenses. However, I was curious how much I would lose to taxes since these funds won't be in any tax-advantaged account and if it is smart to invest this much in a normal brokerage account if I want to eventually achieve my goal of living off dividends (or at least have the option to).

On a side note, anyone got any good books/resources they recommend that mainly focus on dividend investing. Mainly watch YouTube videos and read Reddit posts as of now",12-30-2023

"Switching to Dividend portfolio after 58Hi guys although i am not 58 but 20 years younger. I am still confused on what to do to switch to income stocks at 58, my desired retirement date. 

I hold ITOT, VTI, AAPL,AMZN,TESLA,FZROX, FXAIX, FNLIX, FSKAX. Distributed across different pre and post tax accounts. 

So in 20 years i will not need the growth but monthly income.

I have done some research and figured below stocks i will own when time comes.

SCHD, VUG VYM JEPI VOO DIVO. 

Hypothetically if i end up with 3.2 million by 58 in those growth stocks  will i be dividing this amount equally to post retirement stocks ? Sell and pay taxes then buy these to get at-least 12K/month ?

"Diversity is keyiv put some thought lately Into this and really all you need is JEPQ and SCHD and your good, however there are two caviaiarts ,

one you miss out on capital gains from superstar picks, example being McDonald's has gained me almost 40% in the last 12 months, you need to add individual div stocks to hit some good ones in the longer term,

Two there is greater risk in not splitting 4% or 3% portfolio principle Max's into areas, if one these ETF liquidated in a blackswan or a credit default it could ruin someone's life. why diversity works and is the safer investment approach.

personally I also have been chasing more growth stocks particularly the blue chips Tesla and recently my eyes looking at Disney and even INTC as a possible 5 year superstar play, as competition is surly to raise against NVDA just a food for thought to the investment bros, I'm all for the Etfs and a simple 4 stock portfolio is simple and easy but if your a real investor and you take things seriously then having a 60 stock portfolio is the way.

I'm coming up 30 and iv been somewhat obsessed with Dividend stocks in my 10 years of investing but from my mistakes I wish I looked harder at some of the growth stock opportunities..... O for an example could see some brilliant preformance in 2025 from these current levels unless diversity is welcomed then you will never bag it.",08-29-2023
"Bought 2538 shares of TSLY this week to see how it goes.Running an experiment with TSLY.  Bought 2538 shares at a basis of $13.79 to see how well these funds actually work.

I've made $1k in capital appreciation so far, which is emotionally reassuring, but meaningless.  My buy case:

* I'm a believer in Tesla over the long term.
* Tesla volatility is insane.  It's not a meme stock, but has almost that level of obsession over it.  People trading in and out all the time.
* Saw an article that says ""TSLY is not how to play Tesla.""  I disagree.  If it's going to be that volatile, may as well profit off the volatility, instead of seeing your paper gains erased over and over again.  But then, I'm into dividends, so there's that.
* Reinvesting the dividends into other assets.  So for the first 18 months - 2 years, the functional effect is that I sold my previous position to DCA into the assets I'm reinvesting into.  Only once TSLY has paid back it's investment am I really seeing much difference from a DCA (ignoring whatever paper gains or losses TSLY experiences.)
* Curious how much (if any) share price erosion will occur over the next 2 years.  TSLY had a big drop shortly after release tied to the drop in Tesla.  But that's not the same as erosion, which you would get with a \*YLD fund.

I think I'll be ok, so long as Tesla does ok.  If it doesn't well, from where I sit, there's not much difference in risk between buying this and an equivalent amount of TSLA.

Anyway, wish me luck!  Hoping that after 18 months to 2 years, TSLY will have paid for itself in other assets, and I'll still have a valuable asset in TSLY generating significant income.  But we'll have to see how it works out.

EDIT:  The account I bought this in was an IRA containing the rollover of my 401k from my previous employer.  I can't contribute to this account, since I'm contributing to a Roth.  But my thinking was hopefully this is a way of getting some ""stealth contributions"" to the account, from income return on investments.  Hoping for $1500 - $2000 per month in dividends.  Which is WAY more than I could get from any other income investment.",08-24-2023

"Coming back to investing at 29, looking to be pointed in the right direction.Hey y'all, I kinda let my brokerage account simmer for two years. But now I'm getting serious about maximizing it's growth.  Humbly looking for your thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. My portfolio is 32% SCHB and 23% SCHG. I bought them some years ago because they seemed like a really safe pick for a lazy 26 year old. Should I sell and buy VTI or QQQ, which have performed far better in recent years? I use Schwab. They tell me there's 0 fees for buying & selling plain stocks and ETFs; I can't help but feel like I get some hidden value in holding their ETFs over another brokerage's.
2. In general, should I sell lower performers in order to buy higher performers? Or do I hold, but subsequently only buy said better performers? I'm looking to safely ""snowball,"" but I recognize that growth trumps dividend income at my age.
3. I bought 100 shares of Lucid some years ago when there was plenty of hype. I'm reluctantly holding, in hopes of some sort of turn around. Selling for $680 doesn't seem worth it, considering the small chance it becomes the next Tesla.

"Investment strategy for growth and dividendsSo I’m pretty late to the investing game (39, began in January).  However I do have a pension with my company and can “retire” at 55 (anticipated monthly pension currently is $3,500 but increases each year as we get a raise).  I’ve been with this company for 12 years and every check they take $150 and put into my pension fund, so that’s nice.  
So I also invest $200 a month (and any extra cash I come across, such as birthday, holidays, etc) into my Roth IRA I opened with Fidelity in January.  I currently have $3,500 in it for the year and so far my portfolio is up 13-15%. 

So I’m trying to absorb as much info on investing strategies as I can.  From what I am seeing, it’s a split between having 30 different holdings or 10 holdings.  Of course everyone has an opinion but the 30 holdings makes sense to me for diversifying.  I currently have 25 holdings, and I am overweight into the tech sector.  I bought NVDA early and it’s now up 220%, so I’m thinking of selling for a stock in a different sector (like Basic Materials as I’m lacking there).  I also have Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple for some of my large cap stocks.  

So from my reading, I have large cap, mid cap, small cap stocks along with international, REITs, and ETFs.  

You guys sold me on SCHD, JEPI and JEPQ.  

So I’m ok with risk as I am late to the Roth IRA game, and my pension is a huge plus.  

So my goal now is growth stocks that offer dividends, so I am selling Tesla for a materials stock (I like BHP and NTR, but doing research).   

So in summary, spread large, mid, small, international, REIT and ETF stocks across all ten sectors (basic materials, tech, financial, consumer cyclical, consumer defensive, energy, healthcare, industrial, utilities and communication services) that may offer decent growth along with dividend payments.  

I’m open to suggestions and feedback on anything I’m missing or overthinking.  

My current holdings:  TSLA, JNJ, NVDA, MSFT, JEPI, AAPL, JPM, MA, SBUX, TXN, SCHD, LOW, TXRH, JEPQ, KLIC, SWBI, TNC, ETD, SMDV, ANDE, SHOP (I know, no dividends but I liked the growth potential), VICI and O.",07-21-2023

"ETFs vs 10 dividend stocksNoob Alert! I am new to the game and did inform myself about dividend investing before, but there is still one thing I am not sure about. 

Saw a yt video about learnings after 5 years of dividend investing and he preferred to have a “safe” portfolio of 10 dividend stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, etc) to be able to keep track of them easily instead of relying on an ETF like VOO, SCHD or JEPI. Now, both methods look legit to me but what are the downsides/upsides of managing your own small portfolio of 10 stocks to having all in VOO and SCHD for example. 

Is the yield of the ETFs lower due to added costs of the 3rd party managing the fund on average? The only pro I see for the etf is the “invest and forget” mode. Is there anything I am overseeing or is it just more  beneficial to invest into stocks that would be in the etf anyway myself, knowing that it is a little more work?

"My current portfolioHello fellow investors,

So I’m not looking for help or advice. I’m posting my portfolio because I see a lot of new people investing in 30+ companies. Which I understand because I use to be that guy. 

A little background about me. I’m 32M working in property management/real estate. I started investing in 2017 when I was 26, which I though was late. I make a modest income. (Modest can mean a lot to everyone). I invest about $500-$1000 a month. 

If you have Schwab, you know what the numbers mean by each position. But I have my account split up in to 3 taxable and 2 Roth.

I personally like growth and dividend investing, together. With this portfolio, I’ve beat the meager return of the S&P each year except last year which I think we all took an L. This year, this portfolio is currently up 88%, obviously due to PLTR and TSLA. 

The dividend part (just the dividend stocks) of this portfolio returns 6.7% or $1325 a year. If you look at the portfolio as a whole it’s a 2.7% Dividend Yield but 3.1% YOC.

ACI paid a special dividend this year which has my current year total $1720. Once the merger is complete with KR I plan on rolling the funds there. 

I’m posting this to mostly help the newer people. I started in the same position as everyone else. Took my else and as I build conviction in these companies, I consolidated. You don’t need to invest in the entire market. Find companies you like, sectors you know, and ride with it. 

Investing is different for everyone. This is my take. 

Take care.",07-09-2023

"Re: Stakeholder capitalismA few hours ago, u/No-Aerie3500 posted in this subreddit the following post: [Stakeholder Capitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/133o4pn/stakeholder_capitalism/)

> My biggest concern for future in dividend investing is rise of esg politics, woke and stakeholder capitalism , because this is just a different name for pure Socialism? Change my mind.? 

I spent the last three hours writing a comment response to this post, only to find out comments have a character limit of 10,000.  Well, I wrote 17,000 characters.  Instead of deleting 50% of my comment, I am posting it here as a separate post.  You can see my response below.  Since I just copy/pasted it, the formatting may be off slightly.  I will go back and edit it to fit any formatting mistakes.

\-------------------------

I will take your post in good faith, even though it is worded in a way some may find offensive.

I will talk about all three of the principles you brought up: woke, ESG, and Stakeholder capitalism.  

I will start with stakeholder capitalism.

Stakeholder capitalism essentially means that companies must take into account the opinions and beliefs of those who will be affected by their decisions.  In my opinion, that is a good thing.  Both from a citizen perspective, and a shareholder perspective.  The last thing I want is one of my investments destroying its own future market just so the current group of executives can get better bonuses.

I move into an investment with the mindset of holding the company for the next 30 years.  If a company is actively engaged in killing off its own market (tobacco), then I do not traditionally want to invest in said company.

I prefer investments that are a value add.  It is often said that in a good business, your best customers should be your employees.  If the people who worked at Home Depot all shopped at Lowe's, would that give you confidence in the products offered by Home Depot?  Probably not.  If everyone who worked at Costco all shopped at Sam's Club, what would that make you think about Costco?

Studies consistently show that employees who are better paid not only perform better, but also generate more profits than employees who are paid less. It makes sense when you think about it.  The employee who is making a living wage from their job does not need to worry about putting food on the table.  They are not constantly distracted by outside life on their work, thus allowing them to focus and perform at a higher level.  This is especially true in customer facing roles.  People genuinely happy at their jobs will create a positive experience for the customer, making them want to come back in the future.  Economists call this concept the [efficiency wage](https://www.investopedia.com/efficiency-wages-5206757).  

There are several brands you know of that actively incorporate this into their business model, with great effect.  Chick Fil A understands this concept to a T, and drills it into the heads of their franchise owners during their training process.  This leads to excellent results, as almost anyone who has been to or worked at a CFA will tell you.  The chain consistently leads the QSR industry in both order accuracy and speed of service.  On the casual dining side, Texas Roadhouse understands the efficiency wage as well.  Amongst the nationwide restaurant chains, Texas Roadhouse is known as having one of the highest starting wages for most positions, and managers can expect compensation packages above the industry average.  Beyond restaurants, you have companies like Costco & Home Depot that understands paying people more reduces turnover costs and improves employee morale.  Netflix (and pretty much all the big tech companies) are well averse in the efficiency wage, with Netflix standing out as a company that intentionally wants to be in the 99th percentile when it comes to compensation.

The efficiency wage is an example of **stakeholder capitalism**.  It is taking a companies decision (how much to pay workers) and is checking that against the opinions of the stakeholders (workers) affected by the decision, and factoring in their reactions.  Paying workers less will cause workers to be less productive and quit, which increases the cost of doing business.  Accounting departments say that recruiting and onboarding a new employee is more expensive than retaining an already existing employee.  Workers paid more produce more profits due to higher morale, thus it is in the best interests of the investors for workers to be paid more.

Next we will talk about ESG.  Environmental, Social, Governance concerns.  As an investor, I am also on the face of it in favor of ESG.  Unfortunately, many companies try to lie and cheat their way onto these indexes, twisting definitions so it makes things muddy, but I will get to that part.

Environmental is pretty straightforward.  Companies should care about the environment. It makes sense that if you are going to make money, that you should try to keep the business environment healthy so you can continue to make money in the future.  Speaking as someone who went to business school, many people in business do not care about the future, only the short term gains.  I like to buy companies with the idea of passing those shares down to my future children, so a company that destroys itself does not really appeal to me.

The best, most visible example of this principle in action within the United States can be found in the logging industry.  For hundreds of years, trees were cut down by loggers and never replanted.  This led to massive losses in forests across the United States.  However, as of 2023, we actually have more forest land in the US than we did 100 years ago.  How?  Because federal law dictates that for every tree cut down for commercial logging, a new tree must be replanted and (depending on state expansions of the law) allowed to grow to the same age as the previously cut tree.  Couple that with increased protections over the forests on federal land, and you see net growth.

In decades past, logging companies would move through the forests, cut down trees, then move on.  However, the laws protecting our forest lands forced the logging companies to change their business model.  And as the American logging industry now readily admits, this shift made them **more profitable**.  No longer were they paying property owners for permission to cut down trees on their land.  No longer were they having to buy land, cut down the trees, then sell the land to developers.  Now, they would buy up parcels of land, cut down the trees, replant new trees, let the trees grow, cut them down, and repeat the cycle for infinite wood production.  This allowed for lumberjacks to settle down in one place, which no longer meant having to pay them to move from place to place.  It also allowed for consistent and modern supply chains to be developed.  Back in the day, they would often cut down the logs, then quite literally [just float them down the river and rely on others to catch the logs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_driving)  This has 100% of the problems your brain races to.  Did people steal the logs? Yes.  Did logs get stuck causing rivers to back up creating floods?  Yes.  Did it lower the quality of the wood? Yes. Was this dangerous? Yes.

This change in practice is an early example of the E aspect of ESG.  Companies making these concerns known and addressing them proactively is something we should commend.  

The social aspect primarily focuses on diversity.  Many businesses (especially in the US) used to have a whites only hiring policy.  Until such practices were banned, it was quite commonplace.  The idea of diversity hiring is often misunderstood.  It is not to disadvantage white applicants, but to rectify the disadvantages that historically were in place for non white employees.  JP Morgan is the largest bank in the world.  It has multiple predecessor banks, the earliest dating back to 1799.  However, despite this long history and massive size, JPM itself recognizes that it was not until 1966 (current CEO Jamie Dimon was 10 years old) when they had a black man as a bank manager.  Aubrey W Lee, who worked in Detroit.  So this means for 167 years, JP Morgan Chase and its predecessors and subsidiaries were unable to find a single black man capable of running one bank branch?  No.  JPM itself admits that the company previously had a whites only hiring policy in management roles.  

Diversity in hiring is the idea that while the company may have in the past had a white only or men only hiring policy, that there may still be residual criteria in the hiring and selection processes that disadvantage non white candidates, leading to situations that inadvertently advantage white or male candidates/employees.  Companies that want to have only the most qualified candidates for a role should actively look through and reevaluate their hiring and promotion criteria from the ground up to eliminate any of those vestigial items that could continue to have the effect of discrimination.

Here is one example:

Many companies have requirements for promotion mandating a certain amount of tenue (time spent employed) at a firm. Oftentimes hourly roles may have a minimum number of hours worked.  All else being equal, most firms will tend to choose the employee who has been with the firm longer, assuming they have more experience.  However, the systems used to calculate said tenue and hours often would exclude time taken off due to pregnancy or childbirth.  After all, that should not count as time spent working in the role, right?  Not necessarily.  Notice how the definition changed.  I first said tenure was time spent *employed*.  But when you did the math, I said tenue was time spent *working in the role*.  The definition has now changed from a gender neutral definition to one that advantages men.  Women who would otherwise be qualified for a position should not be denied because their male colleagues were not under doctor's orders to remain at home away from work after giving birth to another human.  If you think I am cherry picking, such situations are very real. (Insert [Study from Harvard proving the point](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty))  

The company I currently work for used to evaluate promotion ready tenue as the ""date from continuous employment.""  Not the hire date.  Vacations would not impact your continuous employment date, but FMLA leave would.  FMLA protects women taking time off due to pregnancy.  So a women taking a week off for her childbirth under the FMLA would have her promotion tenure length reset, while her male colleague taking a week of vacation to be with his new child would keep their same tenure date without interruption.

Someone working to improve the diversity of a firm's hiring and promotion practices would notice this error in the system, and would rewrite hiring/promotion criteria to rectify this so that an employee's tenure would be based on the date they were hired, rather than on the total hours worked, or date continuously employed.  

My employer fixed the problem by changing the calculations to exclude FMLA, and instituted paid parental leave for all employees.  

This would be an example of an employer taking social considerations into account for the benefit of the investors.  We as investors want our companies management teams made up of the most qualified people, not the ones who got there just because they never gave birth.

Finally, corporate governance.

I really do not like companies with dual class shareholder structures.  Where one group of shareholders gets the voting power, and the other group of shareholders gets a participation trophy.  See [Meta](https://www.investopedia.com/facebook-stock-fb-5205635).  Class A shares are publicly traded.  Class B shares are privately traded, are primarily owned by Mark Zuckerberg, and have 10x voting rights as Class A shares, allowing Mark to exert dictatorial control over the company, as he single-handedly controls the majority of voting rights, so he cannot be fired and can do whatever he wants.  Like renaming the company to Meta and pouring tens of billions into a metaverse that tanks the stock price.

My concern with Meta's stock would be referred to as a corporate governance concern.  I believe one share should equal one vote, and I believe that dual class, triple class, or [whatever the fuck Liberty Media is doing](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/stock-data/faq) with their shares.  I do not care if you believe in unregulated capitalism, this is a crime against humanity.  Get the Geneva conventions in here.  If you need a three thousand word essay taking up 11 pages in Microsoft Word just to explain how your Six classes of common stock trading shares are all working with each other, you are clearly just trying to confuse people on purpose because I see no other logical reason to do all of this, even after reading all three thousand words on Liberty Media's website.

After reading my tangent, it will probably come as no surprise to you then that I find the idea of investing in these kinds of companies to be repulsive. I also tend to find the idea of a dual class structure on its face as a form of market manipulation.  Shares are supposed to be ownership stakes in a company.  If you do not get ownership, what is the point?  Shares are supposed to have voting control.  Can you really claim voting control when the real voting power is held in the private shares?  I personally say no.  If each share class has a certain priority level in the event of bankruptcy, and you have three share classes, should that make me concerned about the way your corporation is being governed?  I personally think yes.

These are governance concerns.  The issue with ESG metrics as a whole is how difficult it can be to pin down what exactly should count as ESG and what should not.  On the face of it, I think that in order for there to be a healthy marketplace of competition, regulations should be written to force companies to take these concerns seriously and to make ESG part of **how** we do business.  The problem is determining where those regulatory lines should be drawn.  

Without any regulations, the stock market would become a casino.  Every business is only worth what the stock has been manipulated to be in that particular moment.  Owning shares means nothing, we are owed nothing, and all stocks would be fundamentally worthless, since there would be no laws to protect the rights of shareholders to influence the companies they own, nor would there be any laws entitling them to any share of the profits derived from the business.  

Because companies want their stock prices to be worth something, they encourage regulation.  However, only to the point where they believe it benefits them.  Beyond their own internal cost benefit analysis, the ""good regulations to promote competition"" turns into ""inhibiting business"" and ""interfering with the free markets.""

The problem with these internal cost benefit analyses is that they can often be wrong.  See the logging industry example from above.  A modern day example would be the adoption of electric vehicle regulations.  All the automakers were against it, until Tesla proved it to be a viable business model, now they all want a piece.  

California banning all new gas powered vehicles after 2030 forced automakers to develop new electric vehicles.  Ford has taken this and developed multiple electric vehicles.  Their most recent being the F-150 lightning.  A vehicle which, according to Ford itself (and neutral 3rd parties) has a smaller carbon footprint than a gas powered F-150 (so it satisfies the environmentalists), while they also project it to overtake the gas powered F-150 both in terms of sales and profitability over the next 5 years. So a win win for Ford.  As electric vehicle production continues to increase, the costs will come down due to simple economics through the principles of Economies of Scale.  Since the electric powertrain is objectively superior to the Internal Combustion Engine [(Science source)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SJRUE..24..669A/abstract) you are replacing the less efficient with the more efficient. 

There are tons of other examples, but I will move on.

Woke. Define woke.  Not really sure what you mean by woke.  In the modern day, it seems to mean ""that which socially conservative Americans disagree with.""  Unfortunately, that definition does not work in the modern world due to socially conservative Americans having a variety of different views, which can often times contradict each other.

Woke is simply a buzzword.  Like benchmarking, or paradigm, cutting edge, next generation, etc.  Companies will always use buzzwords to make themselves sound more important.   Here is an example:

&#x200B;

>As data, digital technology, globalization, new business models and other significant events and disruptions reshape the way people work, our mission is to power organizations with insightful solutions that meet the changing needs of our clients and their workers. Our HCM technology, industry and compliance expertise and data insights deliver measurable results and peace-of-mind, and contribute to an engaged, productive workforce.

This is ADP explaining their business.  They process company payrolls.  They take money from Company A, and give the money to Company A's workers.  ADP adds value to Company A by using fancy computers to make sure workers get paid the correct amount, Uncle Sam (or other relevant government) gets his cut, and doing this cheaper than what it would cost Company A to do this on their own. ADP earns revenue by getting paid for this service they provide to these businesses (expressed as a percentage of the payroll expense, like Visa or Mastercard for paychecks), and they earn profit by doing this service at a large enough scale where it costs less for them than what they charge businesses.

Woke is nothing but another buzzword. Politicians use it to make their own views more important.  It means nothing.  It used to have meaning many years ago, but the term has been so overused that nobody really uses it correctly anymore, so it has become meaningless.",04-30-2023
"Question about buying SCHD and JEPI as a EuropeanHello, I am new to investing and after a little bit of research I found out that SCHD and JEPI are excellent choices for dividend investing, however I am a European and I found out that I can't buy these securities (at least officially) because they are American domiciled.

While it has Tesla(20%) in it but alot of the rest is US Treasury notes. Even reading it says its more to bring notice to Tesla. For this reason i feel it may fail eapecially since 1- it’s a new ETF and 2- net assest value is only near $25mill. So while dividend payout now is tempting, price to buy is lowering so i don’t think the dividend will stay high & fear it may close the ETF.

"Starting over with $170K.Hi everyone,

I started my Brokerage account journey in late December 2022. Initially, I made the decision to invest $10K per stock. It consisted of picking 2 companies per 9 selected sectors. My estimated annual dividend payout is approximately $5K. 

As you can see in my portfolio performance, I have significant losses in 6 stocks, but my biggest breadwinners are keeping me even at this point.

At this time, I'm thinking of selling all stocks with the exception of TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, PEP, ABBV, LOW, & SCHD.

My next strategy is to use the available funds to invest in ETFs, JEPI, SCHD, VONG, and buy more of AAPL. My goals are to have fewer individual stocks, for easy management, and more ETFs. My overall goal is to build long-term wealth and dividend income.

I would like to hear your opinions about my potential moves. Is there a better way you may handle this situation?

Thank you.

"What to do with my portfolio?Hey guys, I am 24 y.o. European. Currently studying at Uni and I will hopefully finish my studies next year. I don´t have regular job but I managed to build this portfolio. And after I am done with school, I plan to invest a lot into stocks from my monthly income.

So here are my few questions, since I know here are a lot of smart guys.

&#x200B;

1. I want to have less stocks, under 30 would be ideal, but don´t know which ones to sell.
2. Is my portfolio diversified enough? What would you change?
3. Which stocks am I missing? Or which ones would you suggest me to buy?
4. Basically overall which stocks would you suggest me to sell and buy? So that I have around 30 or less.

&#x200B;

I want to hold all my stocks and eventually retire and have stable income from them (know it´s not 100 % possible, you sell and buy stocks but don´t want to daytrade them).

Since I am from Europe, I don´t feel that comfortable with holding European ETF´s

I love dividents, and want most of my stocks that pay dividends, but also got few that don´t.

It is around 10 000 $, here is the portfolio :

VUSD around 12 %

GOOGLE around 6 %

Microsoft, Tesla, Apple, O, Amazon around 4 %

ABBV, APD, T, BAC, BRK.B, BLK, KO, ENB, JNJ, AVGO, JPM, LMT, LOW, MCD, NEE, PEP, PG, RIO, SBUX, TGT, UNP, UNH, VICI, VISA, WPC, VOW Around 3.5 - 2 %

"Advice on dividend ETFs for planning to retire earlyHey everyone. I'm 37 and have about $200k invested in my brokerage account(I have a separate 300k in my employer sponsored retirement account). I'm not an active investor, so I have about 70% in SPY, and then 30% split between Appl, Tesla, Microsoft, ATT, and a few others. My thought was to invest in more dividend ETFs and diversify, while looking to retire as early as I can. I've used dollar cost averaging, while adding a bit more when there were clear market dips, so I'm currently up about 7% overall.

"Can an ETF be overvalued if its holdings are overvalued? Does it even matter?Hey all,

I'm still pretty new to investing, and I'm trying to learn all I can. So far, I'm only invested in VTI and SCHD.

I recently learned about NAV (net asset value) of an ETF. Depending on the NAV of an ETF, an ETF can be trading at a premium or discount.

What I'm trying to figure out is if anyone tracks the specific stocks in an ETF, and whether they are over or under valued.

For example, VTI holds Tesla. From everything I've been reading, Tesla is (was?) very overvalued, hence the almost 50% drop the last 6 months. If Tesla is a top holding in VTI, wouldn't VTI be overvalued as well?

I haven't been able to find anything about specific overvalued/undervalued stocks in an ETF. Does this even matter? Am I overthinking this?",01-11-2023
"Thoughts on VWINX?Relatively new to this sub but get the gist of it (SPHD, O, VOO = Good, Tesla,AMZN, NVDA = Bad). I am curious if anyone has looked into VWINX, Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund Investor Shares?

"Dividend Investing ApproachI’m trying to figure out my investing strategy. All year I have been considering moving to a cash flow focused strategy. Right now I have a mix of growth stocks and popular ETFS. SCHD is the only investment that I have in my portfolio with a good dividend yield. Trying to decide if I shift to the dividend approach. 

I’m 32 and My goal is to get my income and net worth as high as possible over the next 3 years. I would reinvest probably half the dividend income live off half so trying to decide how to use the dividends. Currently, I have 240k in the stock market, 20k in SCHD 60k in SPY and 50k in QQQ. Some single stocks like Apple and Tesla. Has anyone moved a large portion of their portfolio into dividends and how have you felt about the decision? I go back and forth i don’t want to be overly reactive but the next 3-5 years I could see dividends being a better play. 

My move would be selll some of the tech stuff and to increase SCHD, invest in a few higher yielding stocks like Ares Capital, Main Street Capital, WBA, maybe O add a few with some growth and a healthy dividend like TXN, HPQ, BMY, AMGN. Any guidance would be great!",11-04-2022

"Undecided between ETFs or an individual stock portfolioFirst of all I want to thank all the people that take the time to reply. I am 19 year old right now studying engineering, although I’ll be turning 20 next week. 

I started investing 2 years ago, however I did some incredible mistakes. I got influenced by those filthy “Finance TikToks” and bought some NIO stock at $60, also got BABA at $250. However I got some nice gains with more conservative picks like ALSEA a Mexican restaurant business, where I realized a 75% gain. I have gladly seen both sides and I want to learn from my mistakes and invest as a way of increasing my future net worth and achieving financial freedom.

I want to start buying now that the prices have been falling, It won’t be much money but I feel more comfortable buying at these prices than the ones we had a year before, I was actually waiting for a drop to start my long term portfolio.

I have read the Peter Lynch book One Up on Wall Street, I am reading the Intelligent Investor and plan on reading more investment and finance books. My main doubt before starting buying the assets is wether to do the simple ETFs portfolio with the S&P 500, International exposure with an ETF and some precious metals. Or changing ETFs for some Dividend and growth individual picks, I personally like Adidas, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Allianz at the price they are right now and of course a lot of USA companies that have dropped like NIKE, Google, etc.

One of my issues or drawbacks with ETFs is the argument of ETFs creating a bubble for the securities they hold, however my main problem is that when you buy ETFs you are buying some incredibly overvalued securities like Tesla in the specific case of the S&P 500 and companies whose direction may not be the best, like Meta with its meta verse, which I am not that bullish on. Stock picking can have a lot of issues too, like volatility, buying overvalued securities and it is time consuming.

I would thank any advise you could give me, since I am new to the finance world, which has captivated me. I also really like the idea of dividend income, although I have read a lot of people telling that young people should focus on growth. Thanks in advance.",10-09-2022

Right now it's trading at: 

\- PE of 4

\- 3.6% Dividend Yield 

\- Price-to-Book of 1

\- Price-to-Cash of 1 (meaning the market cap is equal to the amount of cash that they have on hand)

On the plus side: the chip situation is improving, they have several new exciting models ramping up production (see Ford F-150 Lightning), still strong demand for new vehicles, tons and tons of liquidity for the next downturn 

On the negative side: swimming in debt, clearly behind Tesla & VW in the electric category as a whole, their major products (Trucks & SUVs) aren't in a great spot with $5 gas, sales may decline drastically if we go towards recession. 

My take: If I wanted 100 shares, I'd probably wait to make my first purchases of about 15 share until the price falls to $11....and then buy again at $10.50, $10, $9.50, $9, $8.50 and then finally at $8.

"I don't buy income/dividend stocks on a retirement account, and that's whyNot really suggesting it is the best way to plan investment strategy, but I think I do the opposite of what many people on this sub are doing - I'm buying income/value stocks on regular account and growth stocks on tax-exempt account, and maybe after my explanation some of you might think it is a good idea or show me that it is a bad idea.

It all comes to psychology and seeing income and growth differently.

Income stocks are just less volatile and therefore more liquid in a way that I can sell many of them pretty much anytime without losses, yet they are also giving me some yield. Yes, I pay taxes for the dividend, but at the same time why wouldn't I? It is  my income and I treat it as such - not always reinvesting, sometimes withdrawing and ""paying bills"". This is a conservative part of my portfolio

Tax exempt accounts are forcing me to think for 30+ years ahead, and there I buy more risky growth stocks. Wouldn't care of 50% dip on some stocks there, as long as there's still growth potential long-term. Also, tax exemption might work even better in this case - if simplified, saving capital gains for 1500% growth (not rare for some tesla holders) is much better, than saving 19% (I'm in Poland) on a yearly dividend.",04-30-2022
"Diving into DividendsEvery time I talk about dividends to my friends who are very new to investing, it blows their minds. They can’t imagine a company paying them regularly for owning its stock. An extreme example I use is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway which collects close to [$800M in dividends](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-stock-dividends-buybacks-shareholder-returns-2021-10) just from Apple every year.

[Meme stocks folks when they hear about dividends](https://i.redd.it/7pz2mt3ybht81.gif)

For those who are new to the world of dividends, a dividend is a distribution of some of the earnings of the company to its shareholders and the dividend yield is just a simple percentage of how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. If the stock price of a company is $100 and the company issued $5 in dividends, then the dividend yield is 5% \[1\].

Consider the example of the following companies which have some of the highest dividend yields in the S&P500:

https://preview.redd.it/1eqac1c0cht81.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ccb297d9f0a286eb21a6950d8ea233de8d9102d

If you had $100K invested equally across these companies, you would have received on average around $7k last year just as dividends - this is not including any gains you would have made holding on to the stock. And herein lies the allure for dividend investing.

If you have a significant allocation of capital to these high-yielding dividend stocks, you would get a steady cash flow in the form of dividends while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of capital appreciation. This is considered the holy grail of investing as you don’t have to sell off your asset (*and incur capital gain tax*) but at the same time you enjoy a steady stream of passive income in the form of dividends. There are [hundreds of thousands of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends) who swear by dividend investing and even big shots like Kevin O’Leary have said that he will never invest in a non-dividend paying company \[2\]!

**But**, as with everything else in investing, my motto has always been

>*If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!*

So before we go all-in on a dividend portfolio, let’s analyze if the importance of dividends is overblown, whether we can achieve the same results by investing in non-dividend paying stocks, and finally what the ideal portfolio allocation to dividend stocks should be, if any?

**Why do some companies pay a dividend while others don’t?**

First, we have to understand this difference.

Generally, companies that pay a dividend are mature organizations that are growing relatively slowly and do not see any better investment opportunities where they can deploy their capital\[3\]. Adding to this, a steady and consistent dividend over the years shows investors that the company is financially strong and the management is responsible - both of which make it an attractive investment. Some of the biggest companies that pay a dividend include Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, etc.

On the other end of the spectrum, companies that are expanding quickly typically won’t make dividend payments. The management believes that it’s better to re-invest the profits back into expansion and operations strategies rather than to give it back to their investors. The idea here is that if investors want a payout, they can sell the stock. The returns would be generated by capital appreciation (aka stock price going up) rather than as a direct payout to its investors. Famous companies that don’t pay a dividend include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, etc.

**Which one performs better over the long run?**

Given that there are amazing companies in both buckets, the question becomes which type of companies perform better over the long run. This is where it gets interesting. [Hartford Research](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf) conducted an analysis where they divided stocks into two categories - Dividend payers and dividend non-payers based on their dividend payout behaviors during the previous 12 months. Even among dividend payers, they differentiated between the companies that increased or reduced their dividends.

[Source: Hartford Research](https://preview.redd.it/4pahnph3cht81.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=86371762bfe686295d0e923521c83784fb3b024d)

The companies that paid dividends gave almost 2x the return of an equal weight S&P 500 index and the companies that did not give out a dividend massively underperformed both the index as well as the market! Among the companies that paid a dividend, companies that increased their dividend year on year contributed to the maximum amount of return. 

https://preview.redd.it/4tkt4vs5cht81.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=c59e17531ca4aff8642bf87a5217b226b4481f09

The cherry on top is this: not only did the companies that paid a dividend outperform both the market and the non-payers, but they also did it with much lower volatility.

And it’s not just the U.S market that exhibits this trend. A similar study conducted on a global portfolio \[4\] from 1990 to 2013 gave the following results.

>Dividend paying stocks outperform their non-paying counterparts by a dramatic amount. From 1991 through 2015, non-dividend paying stocks earned just +4.18% return per year while dividend paying stocks significantly outperformed with a +9.7% average annual return - [Factset](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/images/519/95699/LVW-Why-Dividends-Matter.pdf)

**Explaining the outperformance!**

I was as stumped as you are right now when I saw these results. I explored multiple research articles to find a reason for this outperformance. While this can be a standalone analysis on its own, the most convincing reason I could find was that because dividend companies are usually mature enterprises, their growth prospects are not going to be high.

This usually allows investors to purchase these stocks at a discount when compared to growth stocks. *(P/E ratio of Tesla is 209 compared to Coca-Cola trading at 27)*. The chances of all these high-growth companies living up to their valuation are much lower than decently valued companies just chugging along and paying dividends.

If you are still not convinced, here’s a bit of trivia - Guess the best performing U.S stock from 1968 to 2015? It’s almost 5 decades during which we landed on the moon, experienced iPhone, and made unimaginable progress in Computing and Telecommunications. So this company must have created something revolutionary and must have changed the world - right?

The company that a lot of investors shunned (*for good reason*) in a declining industry produced the highest return because it was just a boring old Cigarette company paying consistent dividends over 5 decades! As they say, [boring is good in investing.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/10/11/why-boring-stocks-outperform-over-the-long-term/?sh=54d6cfac606d)

Importance of Reinvesting Dividends

Given that we now have conclusive evidence that dividend-paying stocks outperform their counterparts, it’s extremely important to understand how investing your dividends helps snowball the growth of your portfolio.

Reinvestment is the process of putting the dividend we receive back into the stock. For example, say we have $100K worth of AT&T stock. With the current dividend yield, you would get $2.2K every quarter. Instead of spending this, we buy back AT&T stock for the dividend they issue - and rinse and repeat it throughout the investment time period.

**Word of Caution**

It wouldn’t be wise to end this without covering the limitations of this approach.

* **Dividends aren't guaranteed** \- Even though dividend-paying companies are not as volatile as growth stocks, you shouldn’t solely rely on dividend income as it can fluctuate based on market conditions. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, 14% across the world eliminated their dividends and 41% of the firms reduced their dividends.
* **Chasing a high dividend yield is a bad idea** \- Just evaluating your investment based on how much dividend the company is paying is bound to end up hurting your portfolio. You should always look into the company fundamentals before making your investment. To quote Raymond Dev,  
*More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun*
* **Taxes** \- Dividends are famous as a passive income strategy. You should definitely optimize based on your tax bracket as sometimes capital gain tax (by selling stocks) would be lesser than taxes on dividends.

**Conclusion**

Investing in dividend stocks does seem to produce out-sized returns. Do note that if you are currently investing in S&P500, more than 80% of the companies on the list are dividend payers. So you are automatically allocating a large chunk of your portfolio to dividend stocks. Just make sure the fund you are on is reinvesting the dividends instead of issuing it as a payout.

For those who are all-in on growth stocks, if your investment horizon is long, do consider moving some part of it to well-established dividend stocks as history shows us that companies growing to their expected valuations are rare!

[Historical dividend yields](https://finasko.com/sp-500-dividend-yield/) of the S&P 500 reveal that dividends have been a central part of stock valuations for nearly 150 years. During the 1990s, however, this trend reversed itself. Low or negative interest rates and ongoing corporate-financial restructuring have made it difficult for companies to return money to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As a result, the average annual yield for the S&P 500 Index has fallen to 3.5% since 1980 and below 2% since 2010.

The answer is simple - You need to understand the rule of Diversification. Whenever you buy a stock/crypto/assets, it comes with a certified % of the risk. If you have $10000 and spend it to buy/long on Tesla stock, that is a high risk-reward game because it may be going against you, and that's why it's gambling, not investing.

So my point is you have to diversify your portfolio with multiple stocks and ETFs. If you have $10000, then you can spend it in 3 categories -

1. High Range - [ARKK](https://finasko.com/arkk-holding/) & QQQ ETF
2. Medium Range (Go with Market) - [S&P 500 ETFs](https://finasko.com/invest-sp-500-index-fund/)
3. Low Range - Invest in Dividend Stocks and ETFs

"What are my best options for dividend investing for a snowball effect? Should I wait to invest since interest rates will be going up this year?I would like to start some type of dividend investing that would have that snowball effect. It seems some that I considered in the past were good and lots of people have mixtures of etfs. I’m not sure if I should commit to one or several I just want the benefit of knowing I can take a route that would lead me to retiring and not having to worry about money again. Some I have looked at include; VTI, VIG, VOO, SPYD, SPHD,and SPY. Stocks I have considered NVDA, MSFT, APPL, MCD, KO, and ABBV. I haven’t exactly created a dividend portfolio for myself and intend to start. Most of my portfolio consists mostly of Microsoft, Apple, and cryptos. Recently I have come to the conclusion that maybe I should take up dividend investing. I see plenty of opportunity in it I’m just not sure how to really project my future from it since I don’t have an income yet as a full time student. I want to cash out my cryptos as soon as they rise again and just throw it all in dividend investing and my best performing stocks. I feel this way since I spent most of my time trying to pick growth stocks and I was successful at picking them for a while. For example I owned 30 shares of Tesla before they peaked, 100 of NIO, 20 Ali Baba, and a couple others a total of what could have amounted to over $90k easily. Found myself selling before I could realize the gains and just before their peaks too. So I have realized I was impatient my first couple of years investing and don’t want to waste my time again trying to time the market. Then I tried again and didn’t realize my gains when I was up 30x on my whole portfolio which really pissed me off. At this point I feel I have learned my lesson (first time not waiting long enough second time waiting way too long to capitalize on my gains) and will be prepared to take my gains and then throw them into something with more stability. I really enjoyed and got addicted to the huge volatility in the market but now I just want to have something I can look forward to and have something more tangible than just “hopium”, and I feel dividend investing can provide that. What are your opinions on what etfs I should look at. I’m still interested in stocks, etfs, and other strategies too so all ideas are welcome. I primarily would like to be able to live off of my dividends end goal would look like 30k per year in dividends.",03-06-2022
"I think I learned something today, that might come in handy again and again.I am 2 months into following this new strategy of looking for stocks that have good dividends in my M1 Finance IRA account.  I have some growth stocks mixed in, but in total I have about 12 stocks in my portfolio/pie.  I got into Tesla about a month ago at $1200 and in the last month it lost 20% and is killing my portfolio gains. So I am looking at some of my dividend stocks that are losing a little money or are mostly flat, but yield nice dividends. I picked two dividend stocks that just paid the quarterly yield so I sold them today and removed them from my pie (M1 Finance term) and put all the proceeds into Tesla because it went down so fast (mainly because Elon was selling a lot of shares to pay some kind of taxes) and today I am up 9% by the end of the day.  I was surprised and thought, hmmm, maybe I can keep doing this with flat dividend stocks and use the sale of those stocks to buy into dips when the fall is mostly known and safe to re-invest in.  Keep in mind, that this is in an IRA where I don't have to worry about taxable events on selling stocks. So after Tesla recovers, I can get back into my dividend stocks before the next Ex-Dividend date (or wait til the one after that) and get back into dividend stocks again.

But I dunno about you guys, but my life as a 30 year old isn't totally certain yet.  I didn't settle down and get a comfy office job that's going to pay me reliably for the rest of my life, nor do I have the intention of doing so.  So part of the money I'm investing now (which is not all my savings, I keep some on hand) is money that I might need in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years.  I don't plan on taking the investment out, but I would like to know that I have something that pays me reliably and that I can turn off DRIP if extra income ever becomes necessary.

So it's nice.  For those of you who have large income streams, go ahead, buy your Teslas and YOLO away.  But me, I can't afford to do that.  The guys who doubled their money with Tesla or TQQQ are probably laughing at my measly 22 bucks today.  But 22 bucks to me is a lot.  That's almost 2 hours of tutoring for me (one part of my job).  And the best part?  It's 22 bucks that I can rely on regularly without the need to gamble, speculate, or be worried about the state of the world economy or financial markets.

People with different strategies or ways of living, more power to you!  I wish I was making more money than I am and could afford to go riskier.  But this is the way I've chosen, and I'm happy to say that I've found a way that works for me.  I imagine there may be others like me.

"How to choose a growth stock/ETFHello, 

I have apple, Tesla, VIG, and VOO in Roth IRA. 

  I have 600$ free cash left in my Roth IRA.  I was looking into buying ETF or stock with dividend+ growth. But not sure how to choose such thing. 

Can you tell me what to look at when i want to buy any?

Is citi stock a good one? 

Also please suggest some for me.

"Seeking advice as a 22 year old dutch studentA bit of a background, I am a 22 year old student living in the netherlands (EU). I've started investing in october last year, in january I did manage to get into dividends stocks. 

So now to the my portfolio. at the point of writing this i've have 5.8k euro in to dividends stock. 5k into Tesla and NIO (Non-dividends) and in average I am 86% in the green on these 2 stocks and I have around 900 euro split between PayPal, Square and Asensus Surgical. 

Now I will go in depth in my dividends portfolio. For the people using trading 212 you guys are probably known with the (almost) Daily Dividends pie. This is also the one I use. For users from other brokers this is a pie with will split all the money into 50 dividends stocks put in this pie because their payout dates sort off line up like its almost daily throughout the year. These are of course widely spread into different industries. 

Back into the numbers this portfolio has about 5.8k euros in it, I made around 116 euro in dividends since january and around 12.5% in value of stocks. I am wondering if I should keep this portfolio or switch it all around. If I should switch should I just sell the 5.8k and put it in the recommended portfolio at once or should I dollar cost average during a 1 month period or more? If I switch I will add the 900 euros from the other pie. I will read the advice and I will answer all questions.",10-27-2021
"Porfolio diversityI was thinking about adjusting my portfolio to have VOO, KO, PEP, JNJ, MMM, and O. I understand about just choosing KO or PEP, but I like both companies. (lol) I should have about $1500 or so leftover after everything. Should I invest some into finance like JPM, BAC, etc? And then the rest into growth like AAPL, TESLA, or NVIDIA? or just straight into growth?",09-08-2021
"Something to read before you consider growth vs. dividend investingThere are suddenly influx of new and young investors here on this forum pushing for VTI, VOO, QQQ, ARKK, etc... and started acting like those are the only way to invest, here are some counterpoints to consider.

I have always said that investing is a personal thing, no one invests the same way, otherwise, we wouldn't have > 4,000 ETFs and > 26,000 stocks out there. If everyone only buy VTI and VOO, then aside from the top 500 companies in the US getting investors' money, no other companies would be getting that money and economy won't move.

Lots of young kids on Reddit these days have never lived through a real recession, I have and it was very eye-opening. In 2008, stocks crashed and stayed down over a long period of time that everyone's emergency funds ran out (that 6-month emergency funds weren't enough for prolonged bear market, who would have known ?), many had to start selling their ""growth"" stocks, SP500, Nasdaq, etc... at rock bottom prices to keep their houses due to them losing their jobs. Lots of ""growth"" ETFs went kaput, taking with it billions of dollars of investors' money. Keep in mind that most do not have cash flows and most are out of jobs so they have no choice but to sell ""growth"" stocks to keep the house and avoid foreclosure. The job markets were so bad that I have seen engineers working as barista. Some even cried while working because of the financial stresses.

Most people on Reddit graduated from 2013 on-ward where the market has been in the crazy bull run, probably the longest bullrun in US stock history where growth dominated and it really skewed their perception of risks.

There have been historical periods where growth stocks go sideway for decades and doesn't really generate any returns but if your frame of reference is the past 5 years, you will not see this. It's like Dolores in Westworld looking at a picture from the outside world and said ""Doesn't look like anything to me.""

Investing is also about the peace of minds, financially secure and stay invested and not act emotionally. Dividend & dividend growth investing allows many investors to stay in this mode and not making any decisions based on emotions. It also helps many people being financially secured because having thousands of dollars arriving at your bank account like clockwork allow many investors to retire early, pay their bills and enjoy their lives. You do not have to give a fuck about any boss or working when your dividend payment started reaching the range of thousands. It gave you a peace of minds and insurance that growth investing cannot give.

Growth investing is like a fancy number on a piece of paper, nice to show but have zero value till you sell something. And funny how people on Reddit always advocate about don't time the market but contradict themselves when telling others don't sell when market is red. Well for growth stocks or investments that give little to no dividends, you can only get the use out of them when you sell them. Then you have to time when you sell as well because those are volatile as hell. What happen if you sell them then tomorrow they go up ? You feel like shit, you feel like you time it wrongly. You then make calculations how much you would have made if you sell them today, etc... For me that's a form of mental torture. What if A ? What if B ????

But what about taxes ? Dividend cuts during downturn ? I am telling you now there are some truth to taxes but most are just exaggerated FUD. For instance, the very same people complain about taxes all the time typically live in high-tax states like California, New York, etc... In one thread, they congratulate themselves about how much taxes they could save by investing in VTI but then go to another thread asking whether they should buy a million dollar home, Tesla and let the states rape them in all kinds of taxes: property, sales tax, DMV taxes, etc.... Consider moving to a states without state income taxes if you are doing dividend investing. Lots of them are very affordable and have great economy: Florida, Texas, Tennessee, etc.... Also it always amuses me that ""growth"" investors always act like qualified dividends don't exist, they are generally tax free if you are married and make less than 105k income annually. Read into this so you are more aware of the FUD the ""growth"" advocates throw at you the next time you see them around.

About dividend cuts during downturn, if you bother to do research, there are dividend cuts during downturns but they are typically not as drastic as the market drop. For instance, if the market drops 30%, dividend cuts normally stays within the 10% range. There are lots of researches about this, do some reading. Don't just straight out believe in FUD someone gives to you on a forum such as Reddit.

And Schwab research has proven that over a very long period of time, dividend investing beats all:

Link: [https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/it-may-be-time-to-consider-dividend-paying-stocks](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/it-may-be-time-to-consider-dividend-paying-stocks)

Pay attention to this particular conclusion from Schwab:

    Over the past 40 years, stocks that maintained or grew their dividends outperformed those that cut their payouts or offered none at all.

And backtesting SCHD all the way back to 1999 shows that it beats VOO, VTI by at least 4% in annualized returns:

(If you don't see the link below, google for SCHD backtesting to 1999)

People here and other investing forums will keep turning a blind eyes and cover their ears for facts that don't fit their narrative and it's none of my business to convince them. At work, I have never interrupted my enemies when I saw them making mistakes. Like I said before, whatever investing method makes you feel comfortable and happy, that's what you should pursue. Don't let some random guys on Reddit tell you how you should invest. Read all facts then decide.",09-04-2021
"Ratio Review: Price to Book#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 

In this write up I’m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric – the price to book ratio. I’m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I’m going to cover how it should be used, then I’m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I’m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. 

#**What is P/B?**
A company’s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company’s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don’t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company’s assets and subtracting all of the company’s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. 

#**Real Application**
Now I’m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford’s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. 

To find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers’ wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of “real” value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. 

Now before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.

The other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it’s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. 

#**How to use P/B**
We calculated Ford’s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.

For example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it’s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won’t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.

To illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. 

But what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they’d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. 

Let’s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let’s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn’t necessarily say that tesla isn’t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back – though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. 

#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**
Price to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I’m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let’s start with the positives. 
* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren’t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren’t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. 
* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks – so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. 
Now let’s look at some of the potential downsides. 
* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars’ worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. 
* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. 
* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. 

#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**
Now, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. 

So, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called “value vs glamor: a global phenomenon” goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. 

However, it’s not all great news. The paper titled “price to book’s growing blind spot” which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. 

The last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. 

#**Conclusion**
The price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It’s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. 

###**TLDR:**
Historically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries.

"Ratio Review: Price to Earnings Ratio#**Introduction**
The world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what’s good or bad, how you should or shouldn’t do something, and what you can and can’t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I’ve found. I’m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. 


This is the first in a series I’m calling Ratio Review where I will be taking a deep dive into various popular fundamental metrics such as price to earnings, price to book, and return on assets. I will start by giving a brief description of how you calculate the metric, followed by how it is typically used, followed by how it should be used, and most importantly, if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. Let’s kick this off by talking about arguably the most popular fundamental ratio out there – price to earnings. 


#**What is P/E?**
Let’s say a company’s stock costs 10 dollars, that there are 100 shares in existence, and that the company earned a total profit of 50 dollars this year. The price to earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is calculated by dividing the current share price by a company’s earnings per share. Well, what is earnings per share you now ask. Earnings per share is calculated by taking a company’s profit and dividing it evenly amongst all shares. The earnings, when divided by the number of shares, results in 50 cents of profit a piece. Now to calculate the P/E ratio you simply divide the price by this number, which is 10 divided by 0.5, which results in a P/E of 20. 


So, is 20 good? Bad? It’s complicated!


#**Is P/E useful?**
If you’ve ever looked at any article, video, or strangers comment on the internet that’s talking about the price to earnings ratio you will almost always hear the same thing. BUY when the P/E is low, AVOID when P/E is high. This is by far the most common discourse and unfortunately is a great oversimplification. 


Some sources you’ll see will take this one step further to say that you should buy stocks with a low price to earnings ratios within their own sector, because different sectors have naturally different average P/E ratios. For example, the financial sector currently has an average P/E of about 23 whereas the technology sector currently has an average of about 37. This is a big step up from the last piece of mediocre advice, but it is still missing a relatively important detail.


Let’s take a step back and look at what a P/E ratio is describing. When you read the fraction it’s “price to earnings ratio” but you could say that it’s a “price for earnings” instead. You’re essentially buying the company’s current and future earnings. In our example above the stock had a P/E of 20 which means it would take 20 years of earnings at the current rate to get your money back. Just to make sure this is clear the earnings per share amount isn’t actually paid back, it’s not a dividend, it’s simply the company’s profit which is most likely going to be reinvested into the company which should raise the price of the shares.


With the idea in mind that you’re buying the company’s earnings it might make sense why it’s hard to compare a new fast growing company with an old giant one. The share prices are factoring in different things. The company that is expected to grow has more uncertainty but also potentially more room to exceed expectations. The other is less concerned with growing and more concerned with maintaining its current market position which often includes its dividend payouts. The P/E ratios of these companies will reflect these differences with faster growing companies having much higher ones. This is why you shouldn’t blindly use P/E even within the same sector. You are far more likely to end up with mostly older companies with less room to grow. These companies may be safe picks, but it is unlikely they will outperform a portfolio with a mixture of new and old companies.  


#**Real Application**
I’ve spent this whole time shooting down price to earnings as a metric because it’s frequently misused and misrepresented, but now let’s talk about where it should be used and if it adds value. It should be used as a data point. It’s not ever going to be a buy or sell signal on its own, but it can be used to compare two companies who are at similar stages of growth in similar industries. Let’s use automotive companies as an example.
Comparing Tesla to Ford using their P/E ratios is a little bit senseless because while they are within the same industry, they lie on opposite ends of the growth spectrum. Tesla sits at an insanely high P/E of about 550 whereas Ford’s is a modest 10. This shows that people have a lot more confidence in Tesla’s future earnings and growth potential than they do in Fords. This is one way to classify Tesla as a growth stock and Ford as a potential value stock and while value stocks have tended to outperform growth stocks on average this gives little indication as to whether Ford is a good value stock or not. If you were looking to add an automotive company to your portfolio and were comparing Ford to General Motors, which has a P/E of about 9, this would be a data point you could look at. You’ll see that these very similar companies have very similar P/E ratios. If you were comparing them and found that GM actually had a P/E of 20 you might give Ford a positive data point in your search for the best value automotive stock. 


#**Does P/E work on the entire market?**
So that’s how you would consider the price to earnings ratio when looking at individual companies, but can you use it to look at the entire market? Evidence leans towards saying yes, at least in the past. The paper titled “The P/E ratio and stock market performance” was published in the year 2000 before the dot com bubble popped when the market P/E was far above average. It looks at historical evidence and finds that when the market as a whole has a high P/E ratio the next decade underperforms on average. Hindsight shows that this is exactly what happened with two devastating crashes happening in the next 10 years and returns being negative overall during this period. 


However, it also makes a series of compelling arguments for why P/E ratios might start to naturally increase in the future. Some of these reasons include people having longer time horizons which lessens the risk of investing, low cost index funds have gotten even lower cost, and the barriers to investing have gone down dramatically. As of 2021 anyone can use a variety of brokerages for free from their phones. All of these things increase the number of people investing which increases the amount of money being put in the market which drives up the stocks prices but doesn’t necessarily drive up the company’s earnings – hence, a higher natural P/E ratio. With 20 more years of data, it appears that this is exactly what’s happening although there’s no guarantee that this will remain.


#**Conclusion**
P/E ratios have remained one of the most popular fundamental analysis tools for decades and with popularity often comes misinformation. When something is faster to say and more simple to remember like “Buy stocks when P/E is low” you lose some of the context and details that make it an effective tool. That being said, P/E seems to have earned its popularity. Every paper I looked into that covered the long term seems to agree that P/E can be used to make smarter investment decisions if it's used to compare similar businesses within the same sector or industry, even if just slightly.


###**TLDR**
A low price to earnings ratio can be shown to provide superior performance, at least historically. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries.

"HELP ! IM MAKING MONEY AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO !
A bit of context. 
Im a 61 yr old carpenter.  After a lifetime of hard work an opportunity called  Covid happened. 
Call it the perfect storm  ( for me anyway). Covid, Robbinhood, access to money & time on my hands.
Just before  covid my son was dabbing in the market with Robbinhood. His experience led me to take a chance and enroll ( something  I don't readily do). 

I mostly invested in REIT'S  With my 9 grand from my vacation  fund. That was May 2020.
By June I had emptied my bank account  & had borrowed  30 grand from my annuity . 
I  had $ 60,000 in the market. 

I learned slow ( wish I bought Tesla ! ) I was taken in by high  dividends. Growth was slow but steady.
I realized I'd never again see a market downturn  like this and was determined to take advantage of  it. 

By November I had learned more about the market and started thinking more for myself. I move large portions  of my portfolio into oil.
I grew up through the oil shortages of the 70's and thought I had a good understanding of the industry.
Stick with what you  know Right? 

XOM, FANG, USDP, VLO ...
I was making money ! 

Here I am 1 yr later  with $160,000. In equity ! 
I'm blown away !  

But what next ? I have 100 g's  in REIT's  and 130 g's in oil related stocks.  I've used as much margin money as I could , 70 g's , trying to make the most of this covid event. But where do I go from here? I know I'm unbalanced  but don't want to give up the earning potential  in oil just yet. Maybe  later this year I'm thinking I should trim my exposure  but go were ? 

The taxes are going to suck but that's what newbies do. We Learn. 
So...
I'm looking  for some advice  on a strategy that will move my portfolio into a long term income source. 

Please help !
I'm all ears !",06-10-2021
"What should I keep in my ROTH IRAI have 3 questions/dilemma and need some opinions

1.So I opened my Roth IRA last year. Currently I have 13k in there. 
I have the following 
apple, Tesla, VIG. 

Obviously I am losing money on Tesla right now but I really do not want to sell. 

At the same timd I don't want to lose money in this account, like what's happening with Tesla, because I can't move money to it whenever I want.

So Do you recommend I sell the apple and Tesla and just keep higher, more secured dividends etf ? I know apple has dividends but I feel it is not  more secure and has more dividends than  etf. 

2. I have is there a trick to move more money to ROTH? 😓 I have 401k with the same brokerage. 

3. I am working part time and my contribution to 401k is 5%, matching is not available by employer. I want  to increase the contribution but 
I am afraid that 401k might plummet ,like what happened in the beginning of covid, in the future. Also if I increase the check contribution, I will have to live by minimum and might be using some of my savings. 

So do you think I should increase it or just leave it as is? 
My income is 30k/year and I am in my thirties.

"Aiming for $100 a month through dividends, received $157.14 for April!Long time growth investor, but switched my focus to dividends in Nov of 2019. I was pretty focused while occasionally adding growth positions like Tesla, ARK funds, and IPOs like PLTR, SNOW, U, and a few others. 

However, I lost focus after a year of dividends investing and shifted back to growth. In March, as Tech started loosing steam, decided to focus on dividends again. Focused on adding more shares of QYLD, NUSI, and O.

In April my goal was to hit 100 shares of QYLD, 100 shares of NUSI, and 75 shares of O. 

QYLD : 183.01 shares of QYLD split between taxable and non-taxable account. Wife added more last week and now she has 55.18 shares. 

NUSI : Added 19.38 shares of NUSI this month, so I have 66.69 shares of NUSI.

O : Added 6.19 shares this month, so I have 63.9 shares of O.

The larger main goal for me is receive $100 + a month in passive income and at least $1500 for 2021. In 2020, received $1137.04. 


Here’s a quick breakdown of what I received in April.

Read on another thread, that some of you hate this kind of post about announcing “I received $x.xx in dividends”, but I wanted to share my progress, provide some motivation, and give ideas for some.

In May my goal is to finally hit 100 shares of NUSI and 75 shares of O. 

Also a new goal is to load up on BST (BlackRock Science and Technology Trust), PSF (High Income Securities Fund), PSEC (Prospect Capital) and PAA (Plains All American Pipeline).

BST, PSF, and PSEC are all monthly dividend payers, so the dividends will compound faster over time!",05-01-2021
"Investing in dividends while young | please critique my narrativeBackstory: I'm 21 years old, been investing since November 2019. Started picking stocks, moved fully to long puts and calls by April 2020, and ran my account up \~60% by July 2020. You know the rest - over-leveraged a couple trades and was down 75% from my starting point by October. Tried r/thetagang for a few months but between college and part-time work, it was just too much to actively manage positions. For reference, I lost about $4k in 2020 from the options trading. 

I've been onboard with *passive* dividend investing for a couple months now for a few reasons: 

1. I know ""everything is overvalued"" depending on who you ask, but I'd rather be in stocks paying out dividends and generating profits than in companies who try to [justify current valuations with speculative technology](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/elon-musk-explains-how-self-driving-robotaxis-justify-tesla-valuation.html) that won't materialize for years, at best. 
2. I don't really buy the ""invest in growth while you're young"" narrative. Growth had a great decade. It might have another great decade, but it might not. People always say you can afford to risk more when you are young, but that isn't really true either. Taking a large loss when you are young will set you back quite a bit. Consider my $4k loss last year, for example. If I had $4k growing at 7% / year for 40 years, I'd have $60k when I turn 60 years old. 
3. I've lost confidence in my ability to ""beat"" returns of a quality ETF in the long run. Took me a year to realize that my interest in stock-picking was just an interest, not a talent or something I was good at. I'd love anyone's feedback on my thoughts here - firmly believe I have lots to learn from others. 

I'm now quite happily sitting on 60% SCHD and 40% SCHV, receiving a projected $340 / year in dividends. I have two short term goals: 

1. Reach $500 in annual dividends by the end of 2021 
2. Diversify into an international value/dividend ETF later this year

A couple questions for the community: 

1. **Has anyone consistently invested in dividend-paying stocks since before 2010? 2000?** 
2. **What are your** **recommendations for non-US dividend ETFs?** I place a lot of value on a low expense ratio. 
3. **Does anyone hold both SCHD and SCHV?** I'm considering getting rid of SCHV in favor of an S&P 500 ETF once valuations calm down a bit, whenever that happens. Until then I'm pretty content. 

**TL;DR - Trying to build dividend-focused investing habits. I'd love your feedback/opinion.**",04-06-2021
"Received $229.73 for March, $435.25 total for Q1 2021A little late due to traveling for Spring Break, but on track to hit my goal of at least $1500 in passive income in 2021. In 2020, only received $1137.04 in dividends.

Since Nov, and all of 2020, I heavily focused on dividends stocks except Tesla, ARK, and a few IPOs like PLTR, SNOW, SUMO, U, etc..

"My current progress towards goal of $60k/yrOver the last 9 months or so, I have joined countless financial forums and tried to learn as much as possible. I kept putting off throwing a plan together and getting feedback for a couple of months now, because I feel like I still have a lot more to learn and figure out before I have a fully baked out plan I can execute on. However, I feel like it is necessary for me to get feedback at this point, so I can continue my research and further develop out what I want to do. Thank you in advance for time and guidance!

&#x200B;

**Goal -** Reach about $60,000 in passive income in 10 years.

**Approach to the Market -** I currently have a small trading account (about $9k) I used to get some hands on experience in the market over the last 9 months. The account was through RH, but now that I am looking to get more serious I have transferred the account to Fidelity. If there is a market correction/significant dip this year (no one has a crystal ball), I plan to take a good portion of my cash (about $60k) and invest into the market at a 60/30/10% split between dividends, long term growth, and day trading.

* **Dividends** \- The list of dividend stocks on the attached sheet are a list of stocks I've come across during my research. I have a feeling I will need to scale back on the amount of unique stocks on this list and take a more focused approach. I did a hypothetical spread of how much of each stock I would own, and matched it fairly close to the Recommended Sector Spread through Fidelity. \*\*\*NOTE - I do not have and Real Estate plays on this list, because I am investing in Real Estate on the side on my own.\*\*\*
   * Essentially I would like to settle on a well rounded, long term list to dump a good amount of cash into at the beginning, reinvest the dividends, and add an additional $500-1,000/month to purchase more shares.
* **Long Term Holds** \- I feel like I should have some positions that I bet on as a potential long term boom (like Tesla, Amazon, or etc.) since I am still only 30. I currently hold BB and PLTR as long term plays, and have found some other potential symbols during my research. I need to understand how I would evaluate my positions here and probably need to do a better job diversifying. *\*\*NOTE - I bought BB when it was around $5, before it rocketed with all the GME stuff. In retrospect I should've sold when it was in the $20's, but hey I got greedy and wanted $30 and would of gotten it if RH didn't block the trades lol. That being said, I still believe in the future value of BB.\*\**
* **Day Trading** \- I think I should invest the last percent into day trading just so I can stay involved in the market and maybe have some  wins here and there. Also, the theory is that if I can make some good returns here I can put it back into my dividend plays.

https://www.investingcalculator.org/investment/intrinsic-value/

You plug in the EPS, EPS growth rate, bond yield, and current stock price to arrive at a margin of safety. Microsoft was at a nice 35% while Tesla is at negative 2000 lol.

Might be old hand for some of you (and I don't think it will work for REITs since they aren't considered for normal earnings) but I thought it was very simple and at least a place to start for those more oriented to value instead of yolo.",02-07-2021

I could collar it by buying the 250 put and selling a covered call at 290 with net cost of zero.

My overall downside is zero. The stock could drop 50 percent and I could still sell it for 250 in JAN 2025. My upside would be limited to (290 - 250) = \~15 percent, but getting this upside with zero downside seems almost too good to be true. Am I missing something here?",12-19-2023
How much of a company can you aquire through calls?If you bought every single call available with like more than 2 months expiration regardless of strike price and a tesla or gamestop situation happened where the price rapidly shot up in a few months how much of the company would you control if you exercised all those calls?,11-26-2023
"Print money (go bankrupt)New shitpost, new strategy. Im comming up with these every minute and yes I will share em all.
Anyways what about selling a TSLA 7day 230$ call so you got a naked call right. But now once tesla hits 230$ you just buy 100 tesla shares 🤯. If it goes below 230$ you sell the shares again.
Now tell me what fucks me this time? Is it required margin, is it trading fees, or a mix of any. 🙏",11-12-2023

"Expected moves this week. Tesla, Netflix, Schwab and more.The VIX closed 19.30 on Friday and was bid most of the day. It was higher the first two hours even while the market was up on the day, an unusual occurrence, especially on a Friday. Some of that can probably be attributed to worries about the Middle East into the weekend but out-of-the-money puts are certainly being bought as hedges, with vol below the 20 delta level now above 20IV in the next two months. Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides. (they also could be completely correct and the market slow grinds higher into year-end, but the point is the VIX is not ""broken"" and still tells a story when it gets above 20).

The expected move for this week in SPY is a bit more than 1.5%. QQQ is about 2%. 0DTE expected moves in SPY has been pretty consistently near the 0.7% range, and QQQ 0DTE expected moves have been closing in on 1% a day. That's alot more than over the Summer when SPY 0DTE expected moves were consistently below a half a percent a day.

The big story on the stock front this week is earnings, with the regional banks starting to report (as well as the rest of the big Wall Street banks, and then tech reports start to heat up, led by Netflix and Tesla this week.

The one-month range in Tesla more or less lines up with the expected move for earnings this week. Here's how an Iron Condor at the expected move's breakevens line up, positioning for the chance that TSLA stays within that range following its report:

"Covered CallHi all,

I just have a quick question regarding how you could possibly lose money with covered calls.

Let's use Tesla as an example:

TSLA 10/11 Share Price: 263.00

Buy 100 shares for $26,300

Write TSLA Call 11/17 (37 days) Strike Price 285.00, 8.50

Collect $850 of premium, $850/$26,300 = 3.231% ROE for 37/365 days or 31.873% annual

If Called, TSLA > $285, contract exercised, Sell 100 TSLA shares @ $285

$28,500/$26,300 = 8.365% ROE for 37/365 days or 82.5205% annual.

If OTM, TSLA < $285, contract expires worthless. 0$.

T-bills are currently at 5.42% or .549% for 37/365 days.

I understand the obvious risk is that TSLA would decline in share price and would lose value that way, but why does it matter if it's a stock planned on keeping in my portfolio. If the contract isn't exercised, the contract could be written again next month for more passive income. I understand this strategy places a cap on the maximum rate of return, but for the average investor this makes way more logical sense to me than risk-free investments (t-bills, CDs, HYSA), (given they have the initial capital outlay to have 100 shares of a company within a diversified portfolio). I know that this is disregarding taxes that would lower these figures, but they would still be higher than risk-free investments.

Am I missing something or is this a passive income method logical?",10-11-2023
"Expected Moves this week, Oracle, Adobe, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.Qualcomm and Tesla are among the stocks powering the QQQ's higher this morning. Tesla received an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, Qualcomm is higher on news of providing 5G chips for iPhones out through 2026.

On the earnings from this week, we have Oracle today after the bell, and Adobe on Thursday. The big economic data of the week is CPI on Wednesday but we also have the ECB rate decision, US Retail Sales, and PPI on Thursday. All potentially market moving.

**Weekly Expected Moves:**

* SPY: 1.1%
* QQQ: 1.4%
* IWM: 1.4%

&#x200B;

**Oracle Earnings**

Options are pricing about a 4.5% move. That's higher than the past 4 actual earnings moves in the stock which were 0%, -3%, -1% and -1%. One would have to assume that the reason for expectations of a larger move than recent ones center around any AI updates in the numbers and on the call. AI has breathed life into some of these old tech stocks and makes for a but more mystery on calls.

"Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings PreviewStocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.

Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.

Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6

In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:

https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee

That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.

As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year. So it's NVDA being NVDA.

"Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo AltoStocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.

Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.

A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:

Cheaper stock comparable to AppleI am looking for a stock for covered calls that functions like Apple has good stability and is on the less expensive side around $25. Any advice on how to find companies this way would be beneficial to the both of us as well so I dont have to keep asking lol.

"Synthetic Long vs Stock (Don't understand price difference)I've read some posts on this, but it seems to be awhile back.  Curious what it's like in high rate environment.

I'm looking at Tesla and if I do a synthetic long for Dec 2025, the implied amount I'm paying for a share is 290 as opposed to the current price which is 267.  I'm assuming this premium I have to pay is because I don't have to put up as much capital on the position, and in effect they are forcing me to pay extra money to make up for the difference in interest.

&#x200B;

Yet, the theta on the puts is larger than the theta on the calls, which implies if I sell a put and buy a call, I should be making money with each day.  Which doesn't make sense.

&#x200B;

What am I doing wrong?

I would like to buy synthetic shares as opposed to stock.  Any analysis on which expo and strike are the best?",07-20-2023
"Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.* Futures lower. 
* QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25% 
* Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)

One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.

"Expected moves, Carvana, Goldman, Tesla, Netflix* CARVANA SOARS
* GOLDMAN DOWN 
* NETFLIX, TESLA AFTER THE CLOSE

Carvana is up an unreal 35%+ this morning after surprising the market with an early earnings report and a debt restructuring plan. This obviously caught the option market completely off guard. Options were only pricing about a 10% move for the rest of this week. But this move is even way beyond what options were pricing for Carvana's assumed reporting date, where they had the expected move at about 27%. Either way, it's difficult for options traders to properly price something moving like CVNA has been lately. It's been having regular 10% type gaps/moves and on past earnings, it's regularly moved 30%+. Options can only pump up so much to account for moves like that as traders and market makers are very wary of properly pricing them (compared to how the stock is moving) and then getting stuck with all that premium when the music stops. Here's how options were priced before the surprise:

"Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off. On the economic data front advance retail sales missed estimates this morning.

**Chart of the Day:** Netflix options are pricing about a 7.6% move, a move larger than 4 out of its last 8 earnings moves (2 moves were 20%+). A $5 wide Iron condor expiring Friday, set at the expected move would need the stock to stay between about $413 and $487 to see profits. That $413 level is pretty much the low end of the range NFLX has traded in the past month.

"Expected moves this week: Bank of America, Goldman, Netflix, Tesla and more.SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

**Chart of the Day:**

SPY options are pricing only a 1% move for the week, a very low vol backdrop to the start of earnings season.

https://preview.redd.it/27g2qm0v0jcb1.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f0184f0231a5585a864c45248c779b97708644f",07-17-2023
"Expected moves, JP Morgan Citi, Wells Fargo, and a look ahead to TeslaIn what is the first important look at a sector of the market during the fresh earnings season, the big bank trio of JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi are all higher after reporting this morning. Blackrock is slightly lower. The other big name to report this morning, United Health is higher. As options traders, we're of course looking at more than direction. The magnitude of these moves is equally if not more important. As mentioned over the past week, we enter earnings season with some of the lowest IV we've seen in years, and expected moves for earnings the smallest we've seen in over a decade. JP Morgan options were pricing a 2.4% move, the stock is higher by 2.7% or so pre-market. Wells Fargo options were pricing about a 3% move, the stock is higher by about 3.1%. Citi options were pricing in about a 3% move and the stock is higher by about 1.6%. So options had the moves more or less correct on average, with JPM beating the expected move and Citi inside the move. As a rule of thumb about 70% of the time stocks should be at or inside the expected move on earnings. And of course, that stat is marked to the end of the day for stocks that report before the bell so the jury is still out on today. But it is something to keep a mental note of, whether we begin to see moves beyond the expected move or if options have it right, even at this low level of vol. As it could inform trade decisions, including holding positions into earnings as the vol collapse is quite different than it normally is.

Additionally, and especially as we start to hear from some tech stocks that have had a really good couple of months, are the moves to the upside the ones we see stocks beat, and are moves to the downside safer because there's an underlying bid in large parts of the market? Something to keep an eye on.

"Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event. 

It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa. Tomorrow morning we hear from the first batch of big banks, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Tech reports start to pick up next week with Netflix and Tesla two of the first big names to go.

"Poor man’s cash secured puts reversedI have heard of poor man’s covered calls and poor man’s cash secured puts, but what if I switched the order of buy and sell. For example what if I sold a Tesla put with expiration of 07/21 and received a credit of $680, then to reduce risk I buy a 07/14 put at $170.

"Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print. The expected move for SPY today is about 0.5% with the QQQ about 0.8%.

"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and moreStock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

**Chart of the Day:**

NFLX options are currently pricing about an 8% move between now and the days after its earnings, a move smaller than 6 out of its last 8 actual earnings moves.

https://preview.redd.it/o6q6f7cbecab1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d454ff52d9ca2acf860c7c3d02d16a4cb5a8644",07-06-2023
"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day). Options are pricing just a 10% move for the rest of the month, a potential disconnect between realized and implied.

"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

"Debit to roll up a Covered Call?So, In January I sold Covered Calls on my Tesla shares at a strike of 135 (about 30% higher than the current price at the time). The the stock soared. I have since rolled them out and up to 140, but they are out in October now. 

I've been thinking of paying a debit of $300 or so to roll them up $5 giving me a net of $200 when they are sold or if someone were to ""call"" them from me. 

Is it worth it?  Also this is another situation I got caught in where my shares are at a large loss also, but I was using the CC strategy to generate some income at the time.

Is it worth it to do as I am considering? The paper loss would be large with the calls of course, but in time (I'm guessing a year or so) they'd be close and profits could use those paper losses.

I have considered selling a put to use the premium to pay the debit to roll the CC up.

"From CAPM To Hedging\[This post uses stats 101 but can be approached with little math knowledge because it moves slowly...it builds to a set of tools for determining your hedge ratios for paired trades and aggregating deltas across an entire portfolio if you want to hedge the systemic risk with a benchmark future like ES\]

&#x200B;

 Let’s start with a question from Twitter via  patrick\_oshag

 *If you had to our your whole net worth into a single company right now (public or private), what would you pick?   Berkshire Hathaway is not allowed as an answer* 

 

This is a provocative question. Patrick was clever to disallow Berkshire. In this post, we are going to use this question to launch into the basics of regression, correlation, beta hedging and risk.

Let’s begin.

## My Reaction To The Question📷

I don’t know anything about picking stocks. I do know about the nature of stocks which makes this question scary. Why?

1. Stocks don’t last foreverMany stocks go to zero. The distribution of many stocks is positively skewed which means there’s a small chance of them going to the moon and reasonable chance that they go belly-up. The price of a stock reflects its mathematical expectation. Since the downside is bounded by zero and the upside is infinite, for the expectation to balance the probability of the stock going down can be much higher than our flawed memories would guess. Stock indices automatically rebalance, shedding companies that lose relevance and value. So the idea that stocks up over time is really stock *indices* go up over a time, even though individual stocks have a nasty habit of going to zero. For more see [*Is There Actually An Equity Premium Puzzle?*](https://moontowermeta.com/is-there-actually-an-equity-premium-puzzle/).
2. Diversification is the only free lunchThe first point hinted at my concern with the question. I want to be diversified. Markets do not pay you for non-systematic risk. In other words, you do not get paid for risks that you can hedge. All but the most fundamental risks can be hedged with diversification. See [*Why You Don’t Get Paid For Diversifiable Risks*](https://moontowermeta.com/why-you-dont-get-paid-for-diversifiable-risks/). To understand how diversifiable risks get arbed out of the market ask yourself who the most efficient holder of a particular idiosyncratic risk is? If it’s not you, then you are being outbid by someone else, or you’re holding the risk at a price that doesn’t make sense given your portfolio choices. Read [*You Don’t See The Whole Picture*](https://moontowermeta.com/you-dont-see-the-whole-picture/) to see why.

My concerns reveal why Berkshire would be an obvious choice. Patrick ruled it out to make the question much harder. Berkshire is a giant conglomerate. Many would have chosen it because it’s run by masterful investors Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. But I would have chosen it because it’s diversified. It is one of the closest companies I could find to an equity index. Many people look at the question and think about where their return is going to be highest. I have no edge in that game. Instead, I want to minimize my risk by diversifying and accepting the market’s compensation for accepting broad equity exposure.

In a sense, this question reminds me of an interview question I’ve heard.

*You are gifted $1,000,000 dollars. You must put it all in play on a roulette wheel. What do you do?*

The roulette wheel has negative edge no matter what you do. Your betting strategy can only alter the distribution. You can be crazy and bet it all on one number. Your expectancy is negative but the payoff is positively skewed…you probably lose your money but have a tiny chance at becoming super-rich. You can try to play it safe by risking your money on most of the numbers, but that is still negative expectancy. The skew flips to negative. You probably win, but there’s a small chance of losing most of your gifted cash.

I would choose what’s known as a *minimax* strategy which seeks to minimize the maximum loss. I would spread my money evenly on all the numbers, accept a sure loss of 5.26%.[1](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5236) The minimax response to Patrick’s question is to find the stock that is the most internally diversified.

## Berkshire Vs The Market📷

I don’t have an answer to Patrick’s question. Feel free to explore the speculative responses in the thread. Instead, I want to dive further into my gut reaction that Berkshire would be a reasonable proxy to the market. If we look at the mean of its [annual returns](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2021ltr.pdf) from 1965 to 2001, the numbers are gaudy. Its CAGR was 26.6% vs the SP500 at 11%. Different era. Finding opportunities at the scale Buffet needs to move the needle has been much harder in the past 2 decades. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zfqfg4c8zy8b1.png?width=253&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b304927889c03d6e33536fd2480921543fec73

&#x200B;

 

Buffet has been human for the past 20 years. This is a safer assumption than the hero stats he was putting up in the last half of the 20th century. 

The mean arithmetic returns and standard deviations validate my hunch that Berkshire’s size and diversification [2](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5236) make it behave like the whole market in a single stock. 

Let’s add a scatterplot with a regression. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ct6ujfx9zy8b1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d17d0dd8275d198ca3197bb624c98afe1a9a6b

 

f you tried to anticipate Berkshire’s return, your best guess might be its past 20 year return, distributed similarly to its prior volatility. Another approach would be to see this relationship to the SP500 and notice that a portion of its return can simply be explained by the market. It clearly has a positive correlation to the SP500. But just how much of the relationship is explained by SP500? This is a large question with practical applications. Specifically, it underpins how market netural traders think about hedges. If I hedge an exposure to Y with X how much risk do I have remaining? To answer this question we will go on a little learning journey:

1. Deriving sensitivities from regressions in general
2. Interpreting the regression
3. CAPM: Applying regression to compute the “risk remaining of a hedge”

On this journey you can expect to learn the difference between beta and correlation, build intuition for how regressions work, and see how market exposures are hedged. 

## Unpacking The Berkshire Vs SP500 Regression📷

A regression is simply a model of how an independent variable influences a dependant variable. Use a regression when you believe there is a causal relationship between 2 variables. Spurious correlations are correlations that will appear to be causal because they can be tight. The regression math may even suggest that’s the case. I’m sorry. Math is a just a tool. It requires judgement. The sheer number of measurable quanitites in the world guarantees an infinite list of correlations that serve as humor not insight[3](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5236).

The SP500 is steered by the corporate earnings of the largest public companies (and in the long-run the Main Street economy[4](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5236)) discounted by some risk-aware consensus. Berkshire is big and broad enough to inherit the same drivers. We accept that Berkshire’s returns are partly driven by the market and partly due to its own idiosyncracies.

Satisfied that some of Berkshire’s returns are attributable to the broader market, we can use regression to understand the relationship. In the figure above, I had Excel simply draw a line that best fit the scatterplot with SP500 being the independent variable, or X, and Berkshire returns being the dependant or Y. The best fit line (there are many kinds of regression but we are using a simple linear regression) is defined the same way in line is: by a slope and an intercept. 

The regression equation should remind you of the generic form of a line y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the intercept. 

In a regression:

**y=α+βx**

where:

y = dependant variable (Berkshire returns)

x = independent variable (SP500 returns)

α = the intercept (a constant)

β = the slope or sensitivity of the Y variable based on the X variable

If you right-click on a scatterplot in Excel you can choose “Add Trendline”. It will open the below menu where you can set the fitted line to be linear and also check a box to “Display Equation on chart”.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zqi7y5wbzy8b1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddceb144a7c583bcd5e7416c8124a90044cce499

 

This is how I found the slope and intercept for the Berkshire chart:

y = .6814x + .0307

Suppose the market returns 2%:

Predicted Berkshire return = .6814 \* 2% + 3.07%

Predicted Berkshire return = 4.43%

So based on actual data, we built a simple model of Berkshire’s returns as a function of the market. 

It’s worth slowing down to understand how this line is being created. Conceptually it is the line that minimizes the squared errors between itself and the actual data. Since each point has 2 coordinates, we are dealing with the variance of a joint distribution. We use covariance instead of variance but the concepts are analogous. With variance we square the deviations from a mean. For covariance, we multiply the distance of each X and Y in a coordinate from their respective means: **(xᵢ – x̄)(yᵢ -ȳ)**

Armed with that idea, we can compute the regression line by hand with the following formulas:

**β or slope = covar(x,y)/ var(x)**

**α or intercept = ȳ – β̄x̄**

We will look at the full table of this computation later to verify Excel’s regression line. Before we do that, let’s make sure that this model is even helpful. One standard we could use to determine  if the model is useful is if it performs better than the cheapest naive model that says:

Our predicted Berkshire return simply is mean return from sample.

This green arrows in this picture represent the error between this simple model and the actual returns. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/as1p2cjdzy8b1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e2b9cb1add48164c95ff5e3e6df447c339148d5

 

This naive model of summing the squared differences from the mean of Berkshire’s returns is exactly the same as variance. You are computing squared differences from a mean. If you take square root of the average of the squared differences you get a standard deviation. In, this simple model where our prediction is simply the mean our volatility is 16.5% or the volatility of Berkshire’s returns for 20 years. 

In the regression context, the total variance of the dependent variable from its mean is knows as the **Total Sum of Squares** or **TSS**. 

The point of using regression though is we can make a better prediction of Berkshire’s returns if we know the SP500’s returns. So we can compare the mean to the fitted line instead of the actual returns. The sum of those squared differences is known as the **Regression Sum Of Squares** or **RSS**. This is the sum of squared deviations between the mean and fitted predictions instead of the actual returns. If there is tremendous overlap between the RSS and TSS, than we think much of the variance in X explains the variance of Y.

The last quantity we can look at is the **Error Sum of Squares** or **ESS**. These are the deviations from the actual data to the predicted values represented by our fitted line. This represents the unexplained portion of Y’s variance. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1rffmi3fzy8b1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b052be4c4675c1ed2b15eb13c0048adb100960

 

Let’s use 2008’s giant negative return to show how TSS, RSS, and ESS relate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa0wf9hgzy8b1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f243231dd10421f7ead8914e2536309ea0520cd0

 

The visual shows:

**TSS = RSS + ESS**

We can compute the sum of these squared deviations simply from their definitions:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4qfntajzy8b1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=5330715f05b291ae494034c65e747e19c43e0359

 

The only other quantities we need are variances and covariances to compute β or slope of the regression line. 

In the table below:

ŷ = the predicted value of Berkshire’s return aka “y-hat”

x̄ = mean SP500 return aka “x-bar”

ȳ = mean Berkshire return aka “y-bar”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hg9cedokzy8b1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=17001f458cb11098cb00ee07cf923e9a98678aa0

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/99jjjwhlzy8b1.png?width=181&format=png&auto=webp&s=df7449fe7c2caa4cd87ad3b14993a1864b441b5b

 

  **β = .40 / .59 = .6814**

  **α = ȳ – β̄x̄ = 10.6% – .6814 \* 11.1% = 3.07%**

This yields the same regression equation Excel spit out:

**y=α+βx**

**ŷ = 3.07% + .6814x**

## R-Squared📷

We walked through this slowly as a learning exercise, but the payoff is appreciating the R². Excel computed it as 52%. But we did everything we need to compute it by hand. Go back to our different sum of squares.

TSS or variance of Y = .52

ESS or sum of squared difference between actual data and the model = .25

Re-arranging TSS = RSS + ESS we can see that RSS = .27

Which brings us to:

**R² = RSS/TSS = .27/.52 = 52%** 

Same as Excel!

R² is the regression sum of squares divided by the total variance of Y. It is called the *coefficient of determination* and can be interpreted as:

**The variability in Y explained by X**

So based on this small sample, 52% of Berkshire’s variance is explained by the market, as proxied by the SP500. 

## Correlation📷

Correlation, r (or if you prefer Greek, ρ) can be computed in at least 2 ways. It’s the square root of R².

**r = √R² = √.52 = .72**

We can confirm this by computing correlation by hand according to its own formula:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30x0p5dozy8b1.png?width=177&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1aaf9777579657db3fddc98882675a225a8b195

 Substituting: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nj1smpmpzy8b1.png?width=346&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c8a205d29e0c6fac9a4dd92fbd1e11e46afda1

 

Looking at the table above we have all the inputs:

**r = .40 / sqrt(.59 x .52)**

**r = .72**

Variance is an unintuitive number. By taking the square root of variance, we arrive at a standard deviation which we can actually use.

Similarly, covariance is an intermediate computation lacking intuition. By normalizing it (ie dividing it) by the standard deviations of X and Y we arrive at correlation, a measure that holds meaning to us. It is bounded by -1 and +1. If the correlation is .72 then we can make the following statement:

***If x is 1 standard deviation above its mean, I expect y to be .72 standard deviations above its own mean.***

It is a normalized measure of how one variable co-varies versus the other. 

## How Beta And Correlation Relate📷

Beta, β, is the slope of the regression equation.

Correlation is the square root of R2 or coefficient of determination.

Beta actually embeds correlation within it.

Look closely at the formulas:

Whoa.

***Beta equals correlation times the ratio of the standard deviations.*** 

The significance of that insight is about to become clear as we move from our general use of regression to the familiar CAPM regression. From the CAPM formula we can derive the basis of hedge ratios and more!

We have done all the heavy lifting at this point. The reward will be a set of simple, handy formulas that have served me throughout my trading career.

Let’s continue.

## From Regression To CAPM 📷

The famous CAPM pricing equation is a simple linear regression stipulating that the return of an asset is a function of the risk free rate, a beta to the broader market, plus an error term that represents the security’s own idiosyncratic risk. 

**Rᵢ = Rբ + β(Rₘ – Rբ) + Eᵢ**

where:

Rᵢ = security total return

Rբ = risk-free rate

β = sensitivity of security’s return to the overall market’s excess return (ie the return above the risk-free rate)

Eᵢ = the security’s unique return (aka the error or noise term)

Since the risk-free rate is a constant, let’s scrap it to clean the equation up.

 

This is the variance equation for this security:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p15vxy1yzy8b1.png?width=297&format=png&auto=webp&s=7077da159beb29c4c4ceb4f97430c1b2d9dd18ed

 

Recall that beta is the vol ratio \* correlation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sqvzjrlzzy8b1.png?width=230&format=png&auto=webp&s=3925e6c866d014667c5ea5fe2a2683940b634a3f

 

We can use this to factor the “market variance” term.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ri8tf2610z8b1.png?width=347&format=png&auto=webp&s=4109cbe01562c41c239e5dc15b37301f125fec89

 

Plugging this form of “variance due to the market” back into the variance equation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2p7qsn20z8b1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=860604ff025999eca2a708eabbe01010faafec7d

 

This reduces to the prized equation: The “risk remaining” formula which is the proportion of a stock’s volatility due to its own idiosyncratic risk. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/92tpep840z8b1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=b171be3eb8e57a3fbaf2fb8571031d8e066a12d9

 

This makes sense. R2 is the amount of variance in a dependant variable attributable to indepedent variable. If we subtract that proportion from 1 we arrive at the “unexplained” or idiosyncratic variance. By taking the square root of that quantity, we are left with unexplained volatility or “risk remaining”. 

Let’s use what we’ve learned in a concrete example.

## From CAPM To Hedge Ratios📷

Let’s return to Berkshire vs the SP500. Suppose we are long $10mm worth of BRK.B and want to hedge our exposure by going short SP500 futures. 

We want to compute:

1. How many dollars worth of SP500 to get short
2. The “risk remaining” on the hedged portfolio

**How many dollars of SP500 do we need to short?**  


Before we answer this lets consider a few ways we can hedge with SP500. 

* *Dollar weighting*  
We could simply sell $10mm worth of SP500 futures which corresponds to our $10mm long in BRK.B. Since Berkshire and the SP500 are a similar volatility this is a reasonable approach. But suppose we were long TSLA instead of BRK.B. Assuming TSLA was sufficiently correlated to the market (say .70 like BRK.B), the SP500 hedge would be “too light”.   
Why?   
Because TSLA is about 3x more volatile than the SP500. If the SP500 fell 1 standard deviation, we expect TSLA to fall .70 standard deviations. Since TSLA’s standard deviations are much larger than the SP500 we would be tragically underhedged. Our TSLA long would lose much more money than our short SP500 position because we are not short enough dollars of SP500.   

* *Vol weighting*  
Dollar weighting is clearly naive if there are large differences in volatility between our long and short. Let’s stick with the TSLA example. If TSLA is 3x as volatile as the SP500 then if we are long $10mm TSLA, we need to short $30mm worth of SP500.  
Uh oh.   
That’s going to be too much. Remember the correlation. It’s only .70. The pure vol weighted hedge only makes sense if the correlations are 1. If the SP500 drops one standard deviation, we expect TSLA to drop only .70 standard deviations, not a full standard deviation. In this case, we will have made too much money on our hedge, but if the market would have rallied 1 standard deviation our oversized short would have been “heavy”. We would lose more money than we gained on our TSLA long. Again, only partially hedged.   

* *Beta weighting*  
Alas, we arrive at the goldilocks solution. We use the beta or slope of the linear regression to weight our hedge. Since beta equals correlation \* vol ratio we are incorporating both vol and correlation weighting into our hedge!   
I made up numbers vols and correlations to complete the summary tables below. The key is seeing how much the prescribed hedge ratios can vary depending on how you weight the trades. 

  


https://preview.redd.it/p8ujhzo60z8b1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf5cf8298fa8153b1fce52979fb8a762d44418e8

 

* Beta weighting accounts for both relative volatilies and the correlation between names. Beta has a one-to-many relationship to its construction. A beta of .5 can come from:  

   * A .50 correlation but equal vols
   * A .90 correlation but vol ratio of .56
   * A .25 correlation but vol ratio of 2

It’s important to decompose betas because the correlation portion is what determines the “risk remaining” on a hedge. Let’s take a look. 

**How much risk remains on our hedges?**

We are long $10,000,000 of TSLA

We sell $21,000,000 of SP500 futures as a beta-weighted hedge. 

Risk remaining is the volatility of TSLA that is unexplained by the market.

* R2 is the amount of variance in the TSLA position explained by the market. 
* 1-R2 is the amount of variance that remains unexplained
* The vol remaining is sqrt(1-R2)

Risk (or vol) remaining = sqrt (1-.72) = 51%

TSLA annual volatility is 45% so the risk remaining is 51% \* 45% = 22.95%

22.95% of $10,0000 of TSLA = $2,295,000

So if you ran a hedged position, within 1 standard deviation, you still expect $2,295,000 worth of noise!

Remember correlation is symmetrical. The correlation of A to B is the same as the correlation of B to A (you can confirm this by looking at the formula). 

**Beta is not symmetrical because it’s correlation \* σdependant /** **σindependent** 

Yet risk remaining only depends on correlation. 

So what happens if we flipped the problem and tried to hedge $10,000,000 worth of SP500 with a short TSLA position.

1. First, this is conceptually a more dangerous idea. Even though the correlation is .70, we are less likely to believe that TSLA’s variance explains the SP500’s variance. Math without judgement will impale you on a spear of overconfidence.   

2. I’ll work through the example just to be complete.   
To compute beta we flip the vol ratio from 3 to 1/3 then multiply by the correlation of .7  
Beta of SP500 to TSLA is .333 \* .7 = .233  
If we are long $10,000,000 of SP500, we sell $2,333,000 of TSLA. The risk remaining is still 51% but it is applied to the SP500 volatility of 15%.   
51% x 15% = 7.65% so we expect 7.65% of $10,000,000 or $765,000 of the SP500 position to be unexplained by TSLA.   

3. I’m re-emphasizing: math without judgement is a recipe for disaster. The formulas are tools, not substitutes for reasoning. 

**Changes in Correlation Have Non-Linear Effects On Your Risk**

Hedging is tricky. You can see that risk remaining explodes rapidly as correlation falls.

***If correlation is as high as .86, you already have 50% risk remaining!***

 

In practice, a market maker may:

1. group exposures to the most related index (they might have NDX, SPX, and IWM buckets for example)
2. offset deltas between exposures as they accumulate
3. and hedge the remaining deltas with futures. 

You might create risk tolerances that stop you from say being long $50mm worth of SPX and short $50mm of NDX leaving you exposed the underlying factors which differentiate these indices. Even though they might be tightly correlated intraday, the correlation change over time and your risk-remaining can begin to swamp your edge.   


The point of hedging is to neutralize the risks you are not paid to take. But hedging is costly. Traders must always balance these trade-offs in the context of their capital, risk tolerances, and changing correlations. 

## Review📷

I walked slowly through topics that are familiar to many investors and traders. I did this because the grout in these ideas often trigger an insight or newfound clarity of something we thought we understood. 

This is a recap of important ideas in this post:

* Variance is a measure of dispersion for a single distribution. Covariance is a measure of dispersion for a joint distribution.
* Just as we take the square root of variance to normalize it to something useful (standard deviation, or in a finance context — volatility), we normalize covariance into correlation.
* Intuition for a positive(negative) correlation: if X is N standard deviations above its mean, Y is r \* N standard deviations above(below) its mean. 
* Beta is r \* the vol ratio of Y to X. In a finance context, it allows it allows us to convert a correlation from a standard deviation comparison to a simple elasticity. If beta = 1.5, then if X is up 2%, I expect Y to be up 3%
* Correlation is symmetrical. Beta is not. 
* R2 is the variance explained by the independent variable. Risk remaining is the volatility that remains unexplained. It is equal to sqrt(1-R2). 
* There is a surprising amount of risk remaining even if correlations are strong. At a correlation of .86, there is 50% unexplained variance!
* Don’t compute robotically. Reason > formulas. 

Beware.

Least squares linear regression is only one method for fitting a line. It only works for linear relationships. Its application is fraught with pitfalls. It’s important to understand the assumptions in any models you use before they become load-bearing beams in your process. ",06-29-2023

"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs).

"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

Tesla stock is up around 70% in the past 2 months yet options are only pricing about a 20% move for the rest of the Summer. Options rarely get this name right when it makes big rips higher.

"Strategy for selling options ?If I sell Tesla put options at 270 strike price and it did not hit 270 by the time it expired, it will be auto execised and I will need to buy 100 Tesla Shares at 270. 

What would be the best case to mitigate risk ? 


Should I just cut loss before it even get exercise or should I sell covered calls at maybe 275 strike price ? 


My reasoning is If it hits 275, I am obligated to sell to you at 275 USD, which I make a small profit since I am buying at 270. 

If it continues goes down or move sideway, I can collect my premium to narrow down the losses as well.

Is it a good strategy like should I go with selling calls if it gets exercise or should I just buyback to narrow my losses and continue to sell puts to earn back from premium",06-22-2023
"Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIXFutures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks. 

As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how ""cheap"" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.

"Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.## Market View

**Last Week – Closing with a VIX Level we haven’t seen in years**

SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.

**This Week – Earnings heat up as IV cools**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That’s as low a move as we’ve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.

A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market’s overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that’s not just due to sentiment, although that’s a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.

The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.

So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY’s last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won’t take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.

E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn’t cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.

*Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn’t super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven’t seen much of in recent years*.

"Fidelity closing Options earlyTwo weeks ago, I had losing trades with Tesla where I had sold PUTs at 185 and bought Puts at 180 to define the risk.  Tesla was bouncing around just under 185 so I was waiting until about 1/2 hr before the market closed to make my move and was probably going to roll my trade out to the week that just ended.  When I logged on with 1/2 hr to go, I found that Fidelity had closed me out 1 full hour early.  I've asked why they did this in advance but have gotten no message back.  Is anybody aware of some rule that requires you to be out a full hour in advance if the trade is a loser?  The closeouts occurred exactly at 3PM eastern.

"Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.## Market View

**Last Week – Another positive week and an IV collapse.**

SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.

**This Week – A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn’t necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.

Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):

Via the Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).

Earnings are really light this week but pick up in the second half of April. Next week some of the banks report, with Citi and Wells Fargo late in the week, then things really heat up the week of April 17th with Schwab, Goldman and Bank of America followed by Netflix and Tesla. The week of April 24th sees the big tech names like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet etc.

Risk Free option. Dumb or should I have just taken the moneyI currently have a risk free play on. I bought 4/6 $190 Tesla put for 11.25 yesterday around noon. The price fell and I converted it into a spread by selling the 4/6 $185 put for $11.40. So I'm in a risk free situation from what I see. was turning into a spread a mistake?

"OTM Call Optimal Strike PriceThis is a simulated trade only. 

However, I noticed that the leverage effect for the strike price at 250 is the greatest. 

I bought calls when the share is around $120. Why didn't the far out OTM call give the highest leverage in this case? Is it to assume that the return is the highest, if the share price is closest to the strike price of the call, in this case 250? I always thought the deep OTM call could give the highest return if the stock goes in the right direction. It doesn't look like that though. What am I missing here?

Same question maybe ask differently, if you knew where the stock is heading, which call would you buy then to achieve the max return?

"TSLA Covered Call ITM SuggestionsHello,

I could use some input here and opinion on my strategy.

I have a covered call on my Tesla shares. Back in Jan I rolled it to 130 strike(back when stock was $108) with expire in April. Well, Tesla has popped huge. So I have a few choices I see to do here: oh, and my avg purchase price for the shares was $350 so there is a loss there.  

I've made cash rolling this option so far of about $3k

1. Hold the option awhile longer and see how it goes. Premium is high enough no one may execute it.
2. Roll the option out to June up to $140 strike that would cost me about $500. Although it would result in an extra $500 gain on those shares if it executed. Rolling it however results in a $8k or so paper loss. Which may not matter since later I see if the stock falls and it becomes a gain at some point.
3. Roll the option out 3 months to get more cash out and raise strike.
4. Hold another month and roll in March.

I've only been trading options like this for 2 years and overall have made money. I'd rather not lose my Tesla shares since they move up and down a lot.

I also have 2 other covered calls in my IRA in a similar situation.

really appreciate and learn from all comments.",02-15-2023

"FAANG set to move higher, mid-caps into resistance. Net options sentiment & GEX may be moving stocksThe market saw a glorious rebound this week potentially fueled by gamma-imbalances forcing dealers into buy-side pressure. Stocks squeezed higher before reverting slightly back down to the mean on Friday.

&#x200B;

Funds have been keeping their dry powder tight, but the tide could be changing as institutions start “loading the boat”, per say. Big tech such as AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, et al have been lagging in the rallies as of late, but the data is now telling a different story ([screenshots from the ProsperoAI app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)). Here’s a look at net institutional inflows.

https://preview.redd.it/ut309u5zddga1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf84941f726b2e6b91bb4c5ad6c3e367f769403d

&#x200B;

A glance back at Tesla from prior weeks had net options sentiment at elevated levels for some time, the share price followed suit with a move to the upside.

https://preview.redd.it/vwiks3a0edga1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=39dc4de4271b77635a322d7267382fc2cbc03f1e

&#x200B;

The Tesla rally my have been triggered with the perfect storm of net institutional inflow and net options sentiment. The option activity and net options sentiment may be telling us where the market will head next.

https://preview.redd.it/1c7a5z11edga1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=5013d346f477411160235649d63df62c850b050b

&#x200B;

The market has been wonky and gamma exposure seems to be the catalyst with this volatile move up. IMO we should keep an eye on option flow and let it guide the way for the next move in either direction. A drop in bullish sentiment may give room for the market to take a breather after the leg up we just saw in January.

&#x200B;

Two other names I’m seeing some of the option flow turn to the downside (and possibly push the stock back to the mean) are in GPS (Gap) and MDB (MongoDB). Both of these names saw rather large moves in the last 5 days (over 20% to upside), with MDB already giving some of those gains back.

&#x200B;

GPS showing low values in institutional flow, options sentiment and also social sentiment, but rather high risk on downside breakout. This could lead to more volatility in not just GPS, but more mid-cap names as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ydf9rzr1edga1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff433a1318e9c52faaedc03e19a02d263c9f35e

&#x200B;

MDB was showing a similar pattern to what was found in Tesla not long ago. Elevated net options sentiment for some time followed by increase in share price. It wouldn’t surprise me to see more downside (already 15% reversal last week) should some of the option flow change rapidly with the rest of the market.

https://preview.redd.it/jr5nca52edga1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=516c951d19035afe921746c7dc86641435b65463

# Summary

The slight increase in the downward trend of net options sentiment may be a sign of a bull trap. Although the VIX remains somewhat unchanged (weird), volatility and wide swings in share price are back on the menu. Thus option flow and net options sentiment may play a significant role in guiding us where the market wants to go next.

"TSLA Overview Pre Earnings CallTesla earnings call is tomorrow Jan 25th. The Street has a love hate relationship with Elon, TSLA has taken a beating for a couple of months, but showed signs of recovery in the last week. This is how things look at the moment in the options market expiring on Jan 27:

* TSLA momentum has been moving upwards since last week. Now, we have crossed the 80th percentile. We have had a momentum this strong since last July/August, which makes sense because TSLA just hit a bottom two weeks ago.

* The options market is generally biased towards calls over puts, which signals a bullish sentiment

* The next major resistance level is at strike $150, there is a massive build up of almost 10K new contracts added to this strike since yesterday. Yesterday's OI is denoted by the blue dots.

* 1.2M units of TSLA are currently hedging strike $150, this important because if this strike is not reached until Friday then we will see many contracts closing and MMs will unwind their hedges, further pushing the price of TSLA down.

"Expected Moves This Week, Tesla, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Boeing, and more.## Market View

**Last Week – Late rally saves the week.**

SPY was lower by about 0.6% last week but ended on a strong note with a near 2% rally off its lows of the week on Thursday. The move on the week was inside the 1.3% move options were pricing. The VIX ended thr week unchanged as did near-term IV, with SPY options still in the low to mid-teens for the next two weeks. Things change the first week of February as we hear from the FOMC and see the latest employment and inflation data. Those weeks have consistently seen higher IV across the market, looking almost like a monthly earnings report on the expected move chart (Feb 3rd IV highlighted, note the bulge in the expected move chart for that week):

**This Week – Again, relatively Low IV into this week’s earnings**.

Last week we highlighted how market vol is low compared to what we’ve seen over the past year, and that low vol has arrived as earnings season heats up. That means we may continue to see examples of options pricing earnings moves lower than typical moves in the same stock over the past year. Last week, we highlighted Goldman Sachs (GS), a stock that had risen 6% the week before on the heels of the positive CPI reaction and earnings from JP Morgan. Despite that move into earnings, options were only pricing a 2.6% move for the actual earnings report. Goldman of course missed, and the stock was down nearly 9% on the week. This is something to be aware of around upcoming earnings. One way to gut-check where current vol is versus historical averages is to look at the realized 250 (trading days) stat versus the IV for this week. Last week, we highlighted the fact that GS options were about 25 IV for earnings, yet the stock had traded at about 29 IV for the past year. That was a red-flag that turned out to be prescient.

Looking at some of the big names reporting this week, we see MSFT options 41 IV versus about 36 realized vol for the past year. So MSFT options are pricing a move for earnings slightly more than an average week (but not by much). TSLA options are similar, 81 IV this week versus 67 realized the past year. INTC options stick out as quite pumped versus the past year. IV for this week is 67 versus 39 realized for the past year. INTC has actually moved a lot on its recent earnings, with moves of +10%, -9%, -7%, and 7% (with the +10% most recent). That helps explain this week’s 7% expected move.

So looking at those 3 examples, there are none that are as low as the situation we saw last week in GS, but among the three MSFT options are the cheapest versus last year’s realized and INTC’s are the most expensive, needing a move similar to what the stock saw its past 4 earnings in order for options to not have been overpriced. As an example of a neutral trade, selling that earnings move, an Iron Condor expiring this Friday in INTC would currently need the stock to close the week between 26.80 and 31.20 following its report to see max gain. Here’s how that looks on a 3-month stock chart (see [this trade ](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/INTC/iron-condor)and others on Options AI’s free trade tool):

"Markets RIP on Friday w/ net options sentiment shifting to the upside. Gamma squeeze incoming?Markets closed Friday with a sharp rip to the upside. Call option activity and net option sentiment has been slowly increasing and making a major shift into positive territory.

The market (SPY) has been in a tight range for the last 6 weeks with the light volume over the holidays. In regards to the QQQ, but also the general market, there are two things I am looking at:

* The market has been range-bound for roughly 6 weeks with no clear direction.
* We are back at the June 2021 lows, nearly 7 months of no returns.

I’ve market both levels on the chart below.

https://preview.redd.it/i1ri1jwcntaa1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=30557e850b489da111515be1bc63c383acffb719

&#x200B;

This leads me to believe the charts are suggesting a short-term bottom and an entry with a favorable risk-reward may be approaching, depending on your time-frame of course.

Furthermore, there’s an increase in net positive option buying that’s been going on under the hood of the market. [Chart courtesy of the Prospero App.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)

*Processing img ibd9fx58xtaa1...*

&#x200B;

The SPY average net options sentiment values have been steadily climbing since December. This comes after the large drop that occurred going into the holiday break.

Similarly, the QQQ was not too far off from the SPY which also showed a steady increase (although more volatile) in [net options sentiment activity.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)

*Processing img 5hwlpe59xtaa1...*

&#x200B;

China stocks have been hammered and BABA was another name showing similar patterns of increasing options positioning, this time to the upside. Here's a look at the longer time-frame from back in October when the share price also happened to bottom at -75% from the high. Net buyers of options have been able to push the share price up nearly 55% since then.

*Processing img r7ra1ydaxtaa1...*

&#x200B;

Lastly, a look at retail’s favorite stock, Tesla. The share price is down 70% from the highs and retail has been getting hammered on this name over the last 6 months. Positive options sentiment reaching near the top of the charts with the stock nearing the lows.

*Processing img yvhv1jdbxtaa1...*

&#x200B;

In my opinion once the sellers have stopped and liquidity dries up we may be seeing some sharp moves upward. This will also come at the expense of more volatility (low liquidity), but makes me wonder if the big players are setting themselves up for the market to squeeze higher.

"High IV Alert: Tesla (TSLA)Tesla continues to get battered by the market. ARKK predicted that by 2026 Tesla would be selling 17m cars per year and 5m cars in the worst case scenario. Whether Chief Twit can pull this off is not of my concern. I am only focusing on the overall feel of the market towards the once untouchable TSLA. This analysis is for Options expiring on Friday January 6th, 2023.

* TSLA continues to have a steady positive outlook, based on a bias towards CALLS over PUTS, however, the market isn't as bullish as it was prior to 12/27 (image 1)
* All OTM strikes have over 100% IV, this means that the market is fairly indecisive about the direction of the moves but expects the moves to be of significant size. (image 2)
* There are two medium resistance levels at $120 and $125, and a massive resistance point at $130 (image3)
* Massive support level at $100, with the price being around $108, there is not much room left to go down. (image 4)
* $1B is needed to completely a delta hedge up to strike $130, this makes it very unlikely that the price will go above that.(image 5)
* Strike $120 is currently delta hedged by 160K units of Tesla (or equivalents) in case this strike isn't surpassed by Friday, expect these hedges to be redeployed, creating more downward pressure. (image 6)
* Strike $118 and above have a probability of profit for sellers of 80% or more.

"Wash Sale for OptionsQuestions about taxes for this year.

Let's say I started with $5000 in my portfolio. I made $3000 in a stock and realized that and no longer touched that stock (protfolio = $8000). Then, I bought options of Tesla worth the $8000 and sold at a loss of $4000 (-50%). Then, the next day I bought Tesla options again and gained $100 after selling. I then bought spy options for $4000 and sold for a loss of $2000. I then bought spy options again and sold for a loss of $1000, so my account now has $900 from the initial $5000 deposit.

It’s been so aggressively oversold something’s about to pop, it has to. None of the other factors even matter at the moment. Either when Elon announces the CEO of Twitter or the location of the next gigafactory Mexico, it’s off to the races, and if neither of those things happen… it’s still about to happen. The company is not currently going bankrupt so it’s going to bounce, hard, before it continues its much deserved decline to reasonable levels. This is just market science, I’m surprised it’s been allowed to go this far. I tracked back the other day. On a five year chart Tesla has only been this oversold one other time. In 2019, it sold off 50% over 6 months then when it hit this same level of oversold it turned around and aggressively gained back 50% of what it lost over like 6 weeks. Right??",12-24-2022

"Option price the night before expirationHi,

I started trading options recently, taking advantage of this volatile and surprisingly predictable market. It worked out quite well until today. After buying SPY puts on the successfully in the morning, I took profit and then I saw Tesla, that was coming from its early crash and turned to be positive. I was quite profitable multiple time but I didn't manage the all my position, and I have an open position with 20 12/16 156.67 PUT at $2.4.

Since this is the first time it happens to me. I was like shit, I will get fucked by the Theta and in the morning I will lose a decent amount. The closing price was $2.02, and I check on OptionStrat and the theoretical price tomorrow morning should be around 0.9 (haha… you can make fun of me).


BUT a question raised, since options don't trade at night, and because of the time decay effect, shouldn't the theoretical price at close be the same than the price at the next day open? This being true when theta becomes more important than Delta.

By the way, another question, the strike price of this specific option is quite funny, 157.67… any reason for that?

Tesla resisted very well, strong support throughout the day, I plan to sell early in the morning tomorrow, because I see no chance to end up ITM, any thoughts?

Thanks

Edit: thank you for your answers, well I think IV is one of the explanation here. What a rollercoaster this morning! Opening at $0.8, I closed the position at $1.8... it went up to $2.5! I didn't have the gut to keep it opened any longer. Won't touch this type of thing until I have a better understand of the beast :-)

Edit2: I missed a fuck*ng opportunity, price is $3.7 now. Holy cow! :-) I guess it's a matter of conviction and it was not strong enough.",12-16-2022

It shows the dividend as 113% today

However, this free lunch is not the case, since if you go to

dated November 16 2022 

in a communication issued from ZIM says the Q3 dividend will be $2.95 per share

and that the full year div will be $10.55 per share

So today's ZIM price is around $24.25, so

10.55 / 24.25 = 0.435    so 43.5 % is the actual dividend yield

According to Reuters data

Total Debt/Total Equity (Quarterly)     80.62

Long Term Debt/Equity (Quarterly)    54.39

I have seen higher but this debt level alone does not tell you the dividend is unreliable.

The valuation metrics are

P/E Excl. Extra Items (TTM)     0.51

Price To Sales (TTM)                 0.21

Price To Book (Quarterly)        0.51

Shipping pricing has gone down by quite a bit for all things non oil+LNG.

However, despite the revenue drop the earnings are still positive.

It looks to me like this stock is valued as if half of its ships sank.

I have been buying some but it is less than 1% of my portfolio.

The next date where one would need to own the stock to receive the dividend (the Ex dividend date) is 

Monday 11/28/22

Is there any other news that would explain a stock being down to this extreme?

Other thoughts?

Short sellers have to pay the dividend, though the stock price adjusts to the dividend payout

(the market pushes down the price in accordance with the cash the company spent on the dividend)",11-21-2022
"QQQ has broken the 50 SMA, back in bullish territory? Looking at beaten names: TSLA, SQ, CRWD, PYPLWhat a strong finish to the week while most tech & growth names followed through above their 50-day simple moving average (SMA), circled in orange.

https://preview.redd.it/l6cxg36x0qz91.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f039a5fa9ef395ee94087c8b1d7b63115158b8d

Trends aren’t guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

Below 200 SMA = bearish trend

Above 200 SMA = bullish trend

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven’t been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn’t be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names. More likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered, but are still looking good on fundamentals.",11-13-2022
"Is it possible to bet on a ratio of specific stock pair? For example TSLA/RIVNHi, I'm new to stocks and options, sorry if the question is basic. I'd like to bet on a specific pair of stocks with no connection on their real value. How can I do that?  
For example right now market cap of Rivian is 29B, Tesla 673B. Ratio Tesla/Rivian 23X, my guess in a couple of month it should be a around 15-17. How can I bet on this ratio?",11-02-2022

"Expected Moves, Tesla, Netflix, Snap, Goldman and more.## Market View

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 1.5% last week. That was inside the 2.9% move options were pricing. Similar to the 1.5% move higher 2 weeks ago, markets were much more volatile intra-week than the final result would indicate. Thursday saw a big rally that broke a 6 day losing streak, but those gains were short-lived as stocks were once again steeply lower on Friday. Treasury yields and the dollar continue to be the main drivers of the day-to-day swings. Earnings season picks up in intensity the next few weeks and that may begin to move the broader markets as well.

Implied volatility remained near the highs of the year with the VIX once again closing the week near 32.

**This Week –** SPY options are pricing about a 2.7% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $11 in either direction.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.7%** (+/- $10.50)
* QQQ **3.3%** (+/- $9)
* IWM **3.2%** (+/- $5.50)

The past few weeks we’ve detailed a few strategies for a high-vol environment, including selling high IV (and wide expected moves) via Iron Condors as well using credit put spreads in potentially oversold stocks while not needing a rally to hold (just the stock to stop going lower). We’ll check in first with the credit put spread examples from Oct 2nd’s post that expire this week.

The first was the GOOGL -96/+91 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), which could be sold at around 1.90 at the time, with the stock trading 95.80 It could be bought to close for about 1.40 at Friday’s close. The second was the GOOGL -91/+90 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), also with the stock trading 95.80. At the time it could be sold at roughly 0.26, it could be bought to close this past Friday for about 0.12.

GOOGL stock is only higher by about a dollar since then and hasn’t been much lower than where the stock was when those trade examples were detailed. The key point here is that buying calls or even call spreads in a high implied vol environment is difficult because rallies in the stock have not been sustainable. Buying premium needs a large sustained move to be right when vol is this high. But selling premium in high vol allows for some wiggle room, and can be best described in this case as being bullish, by not being bearish.

Continuing on that theme, here’s a comparison of an at-the-money call, and an at-the-money credit put spread in QQQ, expiring Nov 21st:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01mt1qpks8u91.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=9169ab50abd8a953cd1a8a32d4a38ed390cbe2a0

As you can see, the two trades risk about the same amount. However, buying the call needs QQQ above $273.25, while the credit put spread needs QQQ to not be below $254.45. Obviously, the credit put spread can only make $657, while the potential gains on the call are unlimited. But… The call needs QQQ to be nearly $19 higher from its current level before it would make the same.

Again, this is just an example. QQQ will see some of its biggest names report earnings over the next few weeks and that credit put spread could easily be underwater. But the risk is defined, and the chances of it being a complete loss are much lower than buying calls, especially with implied vol so high.

"Covered Calls on ETradeI have some Tesla stock that I’m looking to generate some income out of on E*Trade. I just applied to have the options upgrade and be able to write covered calls.

I have no experience when it comes to covered calls and I wanted ask if it’s as simple as selecting an expiration date and strike price and letting it ride or there’s more to it. 

I only have Tesla stock on E*trade and I realize it’s more volatile and im not going to straight up sell so I might as well make a profit off of it.

## In the News

Last we checked in on Tesla (TSLA) in this space was with the stock heading into its 3-for-1 stock split. At the time the stock was about $295 split-adjusted and options were pricing an expected move was about 11% for the next month and a year-end expected move of about 25%. The stock did indeed move lower by about 11% but has now rallied right back, essentially now unchanged since its split and near $300.

As we’ve mentioned numerous times, TSLA stock has tended to make quick moves that far outpace option pricing, both higher and lower in the stock, over the past year. But splits can sometimes affect a stock’s volatility. Since the split, TSLA stock moves have been fairly muted, albeit with a very small sample set. Here’s the pricing going forward, with the options market pricing about a 10% move for the next month, and about a 20% move into year-end:

"Sometimes having a plan can be counterproductiveI have a “plan”. I get into a pricing trend on one of the big market caps like Tesla, Apple, etc. and I set a goal. I invest anywhere from 3-4k in options and if I make $500-$1000 the same day, I get out. But I can’t tell you how many times I’ve sold, just because I hit goal, only to realize if I had held a little bit longer I would have made more. My theory is greedy hogs get slaughtered. But I’m beginning to realize that patience doesn’t necessarily equal greed. I am now setting a trailing stop loss to lock in my profits and keep riding it. 

My whole point of this post is don’t feel like you have to stick with the same plan all the time. As the markets change, so should our plans. Sure, premarket could make my option worthless at market open on day 2, but as long that is the exception to the norm…I’ll take that chance.",09-09-2022

## In the News

Over the weekend Tesla (TSLA) announced a 25% increase to the price of their “full self-driving” software. Tesla shares are up 40% from recent lows and off about 5% from recent highs. Over the past year Tesla stock has seen multiple 20%+ rallies that take place over 3-4 week spans. The most recent rally from July 15th to August 15th was the largest of those moves percentage-wise. Since the all time high in Nov of ’21 the stock has put in two lower highs at the apex of these sharp rallies, first in January, then in April. The last large move lower in the stock that happened from early April to mid May saw the stock down more than 50%.

As stated before, Tesla stock has seen moves way beyond option pricing on a consistent basis for the past year, both higher and lower. Here’s a look at the past year’s moves as compared to the current expected move in the options market. Options are pricing about an 11% move over the next month, and only about a 25% move out to January, much less than the types of moves the stock has seen over the past year:

"Upcoming Tesla SplitHi all, just want to confirm what I understand about playing options with an upcoming split.

Basically, with a split of 1:3, whatever options I sold will basically reduce their strike and premiums by 1/3, while my number of contracts increase by 3? I.e. if the price stays roughly the same after a split, nothing will change from my perspective. Thinking to sell some options but since this is my first time, I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing here. Thanks for your input.",08-19-2022
"Generating 20% profit exploiting Tesla Volatility to create iron condorsSo Tesla stock and options are scary. The options can move either way fairly fast. Worst of all, you can get screwed with IV if you hold too long. But what I’ve been doing is using spy as a barometer. When spy looks like it’s bouncing, I try to time it with Tesla’s stock dip and potential option dip to get in (usually call first) and then immediately send out a working order to sell a call against it hoping someone quickly buys it when the stock bounces up $0.50 to $0.80. I then buy a put spread with the same strike to lock in the profit. The trick is to be in and out in a minute or two. So far I get out within 10-30 seconds. There are numerous opportunities throughout the day to pile in. 

Today for example, my cost basis

Aug 26 exp

Long 865c $40.40

Short 867.5c $39.70

Long 867.5p $42.06

Short 865p $40.78

The condor basically guarantees me a profit. Or I can sell these off at different times of the day or even break them apart. I’m usually averaging $50-60 profit out of $250 or $500 per spread (so about 10 to 20% profit). Again, the profits are slim, this is all about volume. If you can do this 50 times in a day, it’ll add up. 

If you get caught and prices start dropping hard, cover your long immediately and take the loss. You might be able to recover another time but don’t play around with Tesla when the market moves against you.

### In the News

In early July when Tesla (TSLA) stock was trading around $680, we looked at how options were pricing the upcoming month that included an earnings event. Tesla is a stock that has tended to move alot more than options are pricing when it gets moving (both higher and lower) over the past year.

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

That 15% move by end of July was pricing a bullish consensus of about $780 in the stock. With this move higher Tesla actually ended July at $890, +$110 above what options were pricing at the time.

After the move higher Tesla options are pricing about 10% for August, which would put the stock near $800 or $1000:

"Cheaper Tesla Options?So I'm not the smartest guy in the world. Maybe you saw yesterday but I didn't understand the risks of options and made a post asking where 100 people commented about how stupid I am. Fair enough, I now learned a lot more and I'm learning from youtube videos a robinhood worker gave me (i called robinhood at like 1am to ask a lot of questions, guy was also really cool). But anyways I posted this on WSB a few days ago and I think it is genius and I am now up far more than when it was posted and it has a long way to climb up in my opinion. Curious to see your guys thought because a lot of you know a lot more about options then I do apparently. Just note it's a risk I was dumb when I bought it and I am still dumb. However I do genuinely believe I am right and this is a great idea. 

Also if u want a video form of me saying this it is here 
https://youtu.be/fBF5KF-bKGc . The text below is probably better to read but if u don't want to feel free to watch.

So basically you probably knew this but the SEC allowed single stock ETFs like a week ago. TSLQ is one that's shorts Tesla and the one I am mostly interested in. I think that people drastically underrated how much this changes things. Literally everything will be different in my opinion. People were saying this is just options with extra steps and let me explain why I think its not. First of all you can buy options on these for a massive discount. Let me explain
Tesla options are very very expensive 
If we look at a date like 8/19 (the first available options for TSLQ) we can see that the calls and puts are over 50.00 dollars so over 5k to buy them. And some are even more pricey and the further out you go (date wise) the higher cost overall.
TSLQ as you would guess are way cheaper. A lot of contracts still have yet to be filled (in my experience the lowest i was able to get was 2.00 for a contrcat that plummeted already) and 2.75 for one of the 0s. 
To me this will drastically change and will climb closer to the Tesla prices because these are again just a way to buy discounted Tesla options. For example TSLQ shorts Tesla therefore I have purchased puts (my positions at bottom) so really I basically bought calls on Tesla. 
The issue is that the trading volume is low which is because it's new in my opinion. Once people start realizing that you can do this and it is accessible in Robinhood I think the will go up to easily a 1:5 TSLQ to Tesla ratio. 
That's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not alot to a lot of you). 

TLDR:
So basically going back to my play I am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these insanely undervalue things. 

My positions 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Fi7Vkn3Uh7P37Ljdfqkx0pu_QrL4BcP/view?usp=drivesdk 

Wish I had more money I can take this risk with but I hope you all could capitalize on it. (Which also makes me money, obviously)
And again I am confident and am fine with taking L if I'm wrong but on the one that I'm down like -190 or whatever that is like 95% of what I put it. Not worried though 

Examples of TSLQ options

TLDR (but at bottom):

Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) completes a 20 for 1 split as of Monday morning. GOOGL was roughly $2240 on Friday which is $112 post-split. The stock has been in a range over the past 2 months of about 2120 and 2380. That is a range of $106 to $119 post-split. The company will report earnings the last week of July and the options market is pricing a move roughly in line with that range, just about 7% in either direction, corresponding to about $120 as a bullish consensus and $104 as bearish. Here’s the pre-split expected move for July 29th, the week of Alphabet earnings:

### In the News

After the close Friday news broke that Elon Musk is trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR). This was not a huge surprise to the markets as TWTR was already trading -35%+ to its announced deal price. The stock was down an additional 5% after hours Friday. Tesla (TSLA) stock was higher last week, and was up after hours Friday on the news. The stock had not performed well since Musk’s TWTR takeover was announced and investors in TSLA seem happier without the distraction. Tesla stock was near $770 after hours on Friday, up from $680 the week before. From last week:

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

TSLA already made the move options were pricing for all of July before the calendar hit the 9th of July. It’s now pricing about an 11% move for the rest of the month.

The Musk / Twitter news may have been portrayed as a surprise over the weekend in the media, but clearly markets weren’t pricing a big chance of it happening. TWTR options were pricing a bullish consensus of about $46 in the stock out to December, well below the announced takeover price. The bearish consensus in December is about $25:

"Theoretically, could Elon Musk set-up a Collar on his Tesla stock if he wanted to or would such a large trade be impossible?If someone with a large amount of shares in a company wanted to set up a collar to hedge from losses, what would the process be?

"Late to the game? Using Spy Puts to salvage portfolio?I've learned a lot from reading on this sub, but I still feel like a total newbie compared to many here.  I only dabble in options, mostly as a gambling past time. 

However, given the market downturn, which we've been speaking about for a while, I feel obligated to do something.....finally. Feels like a slow mo crash, you know it's happening, but you just let it...

I've researched the question, but really more questions come up. 

I have a high 6 figure portfolio, mostly vstax, qqq, with 10 or so blue chips (Tesla/amd/aaple/etc).  

I've lost about 20+% off the top 

What I ask is simply: Downside to doing a 100k spy otm put 6 months out.  If It goes down as expected, hey it'll hedge.  If it just plateaus, well I lose 100k. Sucks, but not the end of the world.

"Synthetic shorting or using options to hedge my positionI have a couple of shares in Tesla and VOO. But they aren’t near 100 shares so I can’t sell covered calls on them. 

I have a bearish view on the market in the mid to long term(6-9 months) and was wondering what my options(outcomes not contracts) are. 

I’m looking to do a bear call spread with a net delta to represent my number of shares. 
ie. I have 22 shares of Tesla. 
If I do a bear call spread of 750/850, if 750 has a delta of .35 and 850 has a delta of.13
The bear call spread has a net delta of .22(.35-.13)
Am I actually delta neutral?

Would it be better to do a bear call spread and buy puts to achieve a delta neutral position?

The idea is to hedge my position without selling my shares. 
Appreciate any insights as to what I should do or why I shouldn’t do what I’m thinking. 

Many thanks in advance!",06-14-2022
"I have 700k to Sell long OTM Tesla covered CallsI really have 350k but with Robinhood margin it’s 700k. I can buy about 900 shares of Tesla with this, allowing me to sell 9 calls. 

I’m interested in selling nine March 17th 2023 $880 calls= value 96k

Worse comes to worse, it hits my strike and I  make over 100k when the calls write. 

I guess if Tesla tanks hard enough the whole strategy is fucked. The premiums on calls are so high it’s so tempting. What do you guys think?

Is there a better stock to do this will to lock in guaranteed gains?",06-06-2022
"Tesla optionsSo I purchased a June 2022 $680 call on Tesla 

Purchase price $5500
Current value $9715
Total profit of $4,215 so far

I was contemplating either:
1. Waiting for TSLA to plateau and sell the option and lock-in in a return
2. write a covered call at say a 10-15% premium for 1 month to expire in 06/22

If ultimately I exercise the option at maturity I would mostly use my margin.  Based on review of option chains it appears that a 800 June/2022 covered call would net ~$2400.  This is also not my only holding.  I’m mostly an income investor and receive around $1600/m in dividends through my stock portfolio.  So I have an ability to absorb losses if Tesla starts to tank. My thought is that I’d likely write a covered call each month except the month of their earnings report. I realize the risk in this, but a risk I’m willing to take.. 

Anyone have thoughts on strategy 1 or 2? I realize Tesla is volatile right now.. but that just feeds into the premiums that I would be receiving.",05-28-2022
"Options strategies to protect against a margin call within a timeframe? (something like protective puts, maybe a bit more sophisticated?)Here's what I'm looking for...

I have a large concentrated TSLA position, sitting at about 50% equity currently. My margin call price should be around $560. I also have strong conviction that Tesla will perform extremely well in Q3, but I have little conviction that it won't get crushed at some point between now and Q3 results.

So, while we're having this rally, I'd like to open some protective options that will save me from that potential margin call.

So I'd think the optimization here is for price per delta at $560, basically, and I'd like it to be really flat across now to Q3. Is there some software I can use to do this optimization? I've been poking around at optionsprofitcalculator but it is difficult to build an optimal strategy. Is there maybe a python version of that that I can build an optimizer around?",05-26-2022
"Leaps options for TSLAWrote about this in a comment on another thread. 

Buying some TSLA $550 calls this week with a Nov 18th expiration and selling calls against them until the share price recovers or corrects for the long term. In my estimation the current share price is not necessarily the floor, especially considering the Twitter deal, and [Elon’s margin loan linked to TSLA](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-looks-scrap-tesla-margin-loan-with-new-twitter-funding-bloomberg-law-2022-05-12/). However, now that he’s reduced the margin loan by 50% (6.5B) there should be less downside speculation. 

Considering that whenever TSLA breaks out it happens relatively quickly, long term ITM calls have a higher potential upside than puts and premium prices are still quite good.

I saw some analysis here about taking quick puts and going in and out, but not much about long term leaps or puts. I’m still bullish on TSLA long term even though it was severely overbought and see this recent fiasco with Twitter and Elon as a solid profit opportunity.

If anyone is going bearish long term I’d love to hear your thoughts on why and vice versa.

EDIT 1: I listed this in a comment below but I’ll put it here as well. After assessing my plan again and zooming out to look at the broader market, I decided to change plans. Below I’ll list how and why.

“However after running potential scenarios using IV vs HV, evaluating the current financial climate around Tesla, and creating a cost benefit analysis using the Greeks, I’ve decided to use this same strategy with a different stock. I’d be able to make the same profit in the short term (1-3 months) while giving up some potential upside in the long term. 

The reason for this was as somebody else mentioned in this thread, Twitter is a very big unknown and I don’t feel secure risking so much money on something as volatile as Tesla when I could be making similar profit with significantly less risk on multiple contracts in a stock like AMD or AAPL. Hope that’s helpful and best of luck.”",05-25-2022
"Sell Tesla $1000 Puts 2024 JanHi there, 

Thinking of selling margin secured Tesla $1000 puts that expires in Jan 2024 when Tesla hits ~$550 or the next major sell off. 

In this because I think there will be a price rebound and hoping to close this when there is a huge price delta change. Don’t mind the opportunity cost just want a lower the risk. 

Question
- What are the chances of being assigned? The extrinsic value is quite large although it’s ITM and the put expiry is still so long from now 
- What’s a good hedging move to take if Tesla price falls below $500? 


Thanks!",05-24-2022
"$60B on Tesla options - Elon musk's portfolio (Dated before 2022.04)This portfolio is at least 2 months old.

"TSLA $955 Call 06/24I haven't really done any option trades before and I was wondering if Tesla is a good underlying to do simple option trades on. 

Do you guys think this Call would be in profit by the expiration date? 

I feel like it would be able to because Tesla is volatile but at the same time it wouldn't be too much of a risk if I were to buy only 1 contract. With Twitter and all I feel that Tesla is affected. I have mixed feelings. 

What do you guys think about this call? If I were to do this call, do you think I should sell the call before expiration?

"Is there a user/page anywhere where I can just copy their call/put trades?First time posting on reddit in like 2 years.

"Covered call TESLAHave 100 shares of tesla and considering selling a covered call. Never done this before

Thinking of selling a CC for next Friday at $900.

Current stock price $795

The  only downside I see is if the stock rallies beyond 900 then I miss   potential profit but I still made the premium from selling the call and I   paid on average $800 per tesla share so will make $10k for the option   being exercised (80,000 spent on shares, sold for 90,000)

what other downsides are there?",05-11-2022
"Bear SPY strategy with high IVRelative beginner here, asking half out of academic interest and half to maybe make some small plays (already got lucky with Tesla puts so happy to sit on cash until VIX is back below ~23).

If I were of the opinion that SPY was going to 300-250 by the end of the year, maybe earlier, what would be an option strategy to play this? I've mostly done simple long options before, but I don't think buying ATM or slightly OTM long SPY puts would work that well because IV is so high that any fall in volatility or inevitable green day would cost too much, even if I was right about the general direction of SPY. 

What do you think of shorting SPY and hedging with a long OTM call? Or selling ATM SPY calls and hedging with a (far) OTM call? 

(Also I can't really do vertical spreads well because of stupid German tax rules but this can be disregarded)",05-10-2022

I'm still learning on how to use options..

Since I think tesla is way overpriced for this market, I'd like to know what's the general opinion on buying TSLA puts to try to make some money in this downtrend.

"I just got had my positions forced liquidated in IBKR to fund a put spread 😖So, I had a Tesla put spread of 1015/1000 that went in the money (became profitable) and I think ibkr went balls out to liquidate all my positions to fund that 1015 put component.

It had liquidated a lot of my holdings plus some of the “long positions” within a bear call spread which increased my margin requirements!

But ultimately also liquidated tesla spread but now I still have 0 bp

# Terminology

***Average***: For a set of values, this is the mean value calculated by summing all values and dividing by their number.

***Standard deviation***\*\*:\*\* Measure of the dispersion of a set of values. A quick approximation is that most values are as low as average minus this, and as high as average plus this.

=> Example: XYZ stock moved 5% average on past releases with 2% std => *most past moves are between 3% and 7%*

***Straddle***\*\*:\*\* ITM call and put, close to delta neutral, meaning not sensitive to a specific direction of the stock price, but needs an implied absolute move.

***Strangle:*** Riskier version of the straddle with OTM call and put. Usually comes with a higher break even and higher max loss / profits.

***Implied / expected move:*** When buying a call, you need the stock price to move up a certain amount to break-even and profit, that is the implied move of the position. Here we are interested in non-directional trades, it refers to the minimum absolute stock move needed for a trade to turn profit for a straddle position, explained below.

For each stock, an expected movement around earnings is priced-in: this means that a movement play (classically a straddle) would need a certain percentage move in the stock price to be profitable. That percentage is usually close to the average move during past earnings of the stock.

We show below key numbers of past moves and straddles / strangles.

"Expected moves this week. Twitter, Tesla, Netflix, Snap and more.### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** SPY was lower by about 2.3% last week, a larger move than the 1.4% options were pricing. Implied volatility was slightly higher on the week.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move this week (about $6 in either direction) into Thursday’s close. Markets are closed on Friday.

**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX once again crept higher, moving from 21 the prior week to just under 23 to end last week. It remains higher than historical averages.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1.8%** (about $8)
* QQQ **2.6%** (about $9)
* IWM **2.5%** (about $5)
* DIA **1.5%** (about $5)

### In the News

Twitter (TWTR) saw more headlines last week, many of them breaking on the platform, and Elon Musk’s account. Following a week where the stock was 18% higher, the stock was basically unchanged last week, Options were pricing about a 5.5% move last week and about 13% for the rest of April. Options are pricing a roughly 9% move this week, and despite a week passing, 13% to the end of April. The company is due to report earnings April 28th.

The stock is now near the midpoint of where it was just before the original Musk news (just below $40) and the highs it reached after (near $53). The 13% expected move for the end of April (that includes earnings) puts a bullish and bearish options consensus roughly inline with those two levels. Musk proposed a bid to take the company private at $54.20 a share but the Twitter board enacted a poison pill strategy to prevent a takeover.

A dollar wide-winged Iron Condor expiring April 29th, with short strikes set at 41 and 53 is priced to risk roughly $55 to make up to $45 (using the mid). That range is in-line with the move options are pricing and the short strike on the upside is right near Musk’s stated price. Options have a tendency to price the obvious at times and in this case those are the levels everyone is focused on. You can see that range and the risk/reward on the chart below:

"American Airlines Covered Call (Update)So a few months ago I posted on this sub asking if covered calls were the fastest way to gain wealth, particularly with American Airlines (Aal) if you had conviction. 

[Link to post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qtoru1/are_covered_calls_really_the_fastest_and_safest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Well here’s an update. Everything was going great, at one point my cost basis was down to $15.50 and I was up like 40%. And then the Russian bs happened. I have no idea why I didn’t sell other than outright greed. The week before I had finished doing the math and calculated that with about 50 trades, maxing out margin, and earning about $0.30 per trade with Aal, I could more or less 4-5x my money. Your can probably guess where this is heading. 

I sold everything and went all in on Aal at 16.13. I didn’t even max out my margin which pissed me off initially.. I started feeling uneasy about the trade almost immediately seeing as that Aal was struggling around 16.19. Debating whether to sell, I figured just sell the 16.50c exp in a day, surely Aal won’t drop below 16….
20 minutes later Aal is down around 15.77. Suddenly I start remembering all the comments asking what I would do if Aal dropped a dollar or two. Well, I was prepared to hold for a $2-3 drop, but surely you have to be smoking to believe Aal would drop past $15. Even if it did I could breakeven after 3 weeks. Aal bounces back to 15.97, I’m feeling confident. I go about my day. Next day it opens at 15.10, bounces to 15.55 before dropping to 14.60. I’m underwater and stressed out. Monday rolls around and it drops as low as $12.46. Triggering a margin call. 

At this point all my money is tied up in Aal. I stopped working because well, this plan was going great and I was already window shopping for a house. Soooo there I was stuck. TD Ameritrade said they would give me a week. Midway through the week I ultimately sell at 13.60. And for the first time in awhile, fear sets in, I don’t buy call options despite me thinking the market is overreacting, mostly because I’m afraid of losing even more money. Only to watch it bounce back to $16.30 two days after TD would have forced me out. 

As of April 13, the stock is at $18 and I am having a hard time dealing with this. I was right about the price, I was right about the strategy but wrong on entry by maybe 30 minutes, two more days or extra cash would have made all the difference. Margin call would have been avoided if I bought one put on spy, Aal, or maybe a gush call or something to offset but after I got filled my buying power disappeared so I rolled the dice.


And you know how the story goes, I started over trading and ended up losing far more. Currently down 80%. Fucked up part was I bought Tesla 1105c last week @18.30 each and sold early only to watch it hit $48. Did the same for 1130p @20 only to watch it hit $100:/


Last Aal trade (around March 2ish)

Entry: $16.13 shares ($0.13 credit from 16.50c)

Planned exit: $16.30

Exit: $13.60


My advice to people: when you start mentally and physically customizing cars and houses in your mind, you should stop trading options for a week.

I am expecting one final large cash infusion (insurance and gov) in about 2 months and am currently looking to go all in on Uber ($31), Lyft ($32), We ($5), upst ($65), Pypl ($100), Amzn ($2700), aap ($150), BA ($160), Nvda ($200).",04-13-2022

Tesla (TSLA) stock is higher by about 40% in the past 3 weeks. As mentioned in these posts for some time, Tesla options have been consistently underpricing its large moves (both higher and lower) since its October ’21 breakout.

Over the weekend the company reported vehicle deliveries of 310k, slightly lower than analyst expectations. Options are pricing about a 6% move in TSLA this week and about 13% for the next month.

"Sell ATM puts and calls expiring on Dec 31 for tax purposes?Last year I inadvertently was ITM on a bunch of Tesla CCs at year end, then rolled them to the next week.  This resulted in 6 figure tax deduction, with the gains deferred until I got OTM a while later.

I'm contemplating selling ATM puts and calls right at the end of the year to take advantage of this.  If you win, take a nice gain.  If you lose, you roll and defer a bunch of taxes.  Assuming you do manage to get OTM, is there a caveat or downside here?  I believe you cannot sell an ITM call to exploit this, as there are some tax rules about that.",04-02-2022

I don't understand why my options are still so cheap because the price has constantly risen since I bought them. I won't make much profit at this point. I will probably make more profit by executing the option and buy the shares at 650 euros  and cashing in the difference since Tesla will be around 800-900 in June in my option.

In late February, with Tesla trading near $800 I highlighted how options had been underpricing the stock’s large swings since its parabolic breakout in Oct ’21:

>*Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently. Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls. Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops.*

In the past two weeks, TSLA made a low near $760 (a double bottom from late February) and rallied with the broader market last week to close above $900 on Friday. That move to the upside was about the move options were pricing for March (with a week remaining) and implied volatility was lower on the move higher. However, the entirety of its move from $760 to nearly $910 came in the span of just a few days.

IV is lower and the stock is not seeing the large upside skew to high vol out of the money calls than it did during its moves higher at the end of 2021. Options are pricing about a 5% move this week and about 11.5% out to April 22nd:

The premium I get is about 23.00 per share, so 2300 dollars total. If Tesla stays below 815, I just made 2300. If Tesla trades above 815, I sell my shares at 815 per share and make 500 from the shares and the premium of 2300, so a total of 2800 dollars.

After this, I repeat and buy the shares again at the current trading price, and then sell covered calls slightly above the trading price, so I receive a high premium. If I do this each week, could I be guaranteed a profit of 2300 each week?

Tesla (TSLA) stock’s breakout in the Fall of ’21 took it from under $800 to over $1200 in the span of a few weeks. After a late year pullback to under $900 it made another run to $1200 to start 2022. During the market lows of last week it traded as low as $700 before finishing the week back above $800. In other words, it’s been volatile. Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves.

Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls.

Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops. But in this case TSLA stock has been moving wildly since its big breakout and hasn’t stopped making large percentage moves, both higher and lower, since.

We’ve highlighted the 15% or so range (in either direction) that **TSLA** stock has traded in since its breakout in October 2021. The stock has found resistance at the $1200 level and support near $900. The stock finished last week near the center of that range. The company reports earnings Wednesday Jan 26th. Here’s a look at an Iron Condor in the Feb 18th (monthly) expiry. The short strikes of the fly set at the recent support and resistance. You’ll note that is roughly in line with the expected move options are pricing. The risk/reward of the $5 winged Condor is about 2.70 to 2.30. In other words, options are pricing a move to recent support or resistance for earnings, and a breakout or breakdown would mean options were underpriced into the event. (via Options AI):

"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \[1\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \[2\]

While we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:

1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**
2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**
3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**

So it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!

https://preview.redd.it/xethcdd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c64b3059d57df22d9468b0803fd781f12b5e18

**Analysis**

The data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \[3\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \[4\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \[5\].

a. One-day

b. One-Week

c. One-Month

Given that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)

All the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/0x2ikwd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2fb94ba1af493740362bb939e13743b8160237

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/7mbvwrh4fv981.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4edaf25fc2287a0b5700540e989b8662b43bd1

1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.

Another interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \[6\]!

His sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!

Given that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.

https://preview.redd.it/u24my9f5fv981.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7070ae9b8f8db4cf3c95430b67c8fa68c03c605b

Here I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \[7\].

While this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!

Finally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?

Oh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.

Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \[8\].

**Limitations of the analysis**

The analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.
2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.

>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.

**Conclusion**

No matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \[9\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.

I would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.

It only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!

**Footnotes and existing research**

**\[1\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.

**\[2\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).

**\[3\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.

**\[4\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.

**\[5\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.

**\[6\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.

**\[7\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!

**\[8\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.

**\[9\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.

**\[10\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.",01-05-2022

## In the News

Tesla reported on Sunday that they delivered 309k new vehicles in the 4th quarter, beating analyst estimates. TSLA stock finished 2021 at around $1060, in the middle of a range for the final 2 months that saw highs above $1200 and a low just below $900. Tesla is set to report earnings the last week of January. Options are not pricing movement outside of that recent high or low until February. Here’s how that range translates into a $25 wide Iron Condor expiring Feb 18th, about a $1400 risk to $1000 reward profile (via Options AI):

"DeJa'Vu possible FED Day repeat … Warning. 12/16/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY. 

Goodmorning traders, Yesterday I said the rally does not have legs and here we are. Today is really important as to how next we plays out. It is expiration Friday, so big moves are likely. Picture the market being a runner and that you can only run so far before you are out of breath. When you run out of breath and got tired instead of putting your hands on your knees or walking to cool down you consolidated or walked/ran backwards to cool down. Also like any runner you build up your distance and endurance each time you run. This is the market right now; it is building up endurance to run (longer sell offs) and these sharp rallies are cool down periods. Which brings me to a conflicted moment. There is a level that if we fall below it opens up the pandora’s box of sell side activity. That level I believe to be around 450 on the spy. Can we build up enough endurance to run that far, will large fund managers join the selling to get us there? I have said that large fund managers are doing everything they can to hold on to getting their bonuses for this quarter by piling into a few mega cap stocks to window dress portfolios (can they hold it together thru the year end?).  

Key levels to watch... Resistance 465, 467/468 and 470-472 area. Support 462, 460 and 458-456.  I see this shaping up just like the fed day we start pushing lower and when you think we are going off the cliff we reverse with a sharp bounce. Look for bounces in Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft to be the start of the turnaround on the day. Todays close is important, if we fade going into close, we could come into next we with a huge gap down so be careful.

"Happy fed day with brief relief rally insight. 12/15/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY. 

Goodmorning traders, Apple slipped and so did the market. So now I look for a bounce back in Apple which will spark Nvidia, Tesla to do the same. However, watch Microsoft and Google because they could be what holds or keep the bounce from getting legs and running back to the top. 

Fomc meeting today, saw I guess the market is waiting to see how much they taper and change policy. (Funny how the technical always seem to consolidate and levitate before the announcement). The fed doesn’t have back anymore and I guess it will be reflected in future trade. How far can this get this close to the end of the year, maybe just back to the lows or just be low 447. I think this is all just a preview of what is to come next year. 

Technical: we gap down on the daily but only to make a spinning top which is a candle that says pause wait for further confirmation. So let see what happens the rest of the week to see if this pause and bounce can turn into something other than a relief between selling activity. 

Key levels to watch... Resistance 464, 466/467 and 468-470 area. Support 461, 460 and 458-456. Battle ground areas today are 464 to go higher and 463 to go lower.  Today's scenarios... 

1)  Range Day structure. Establish 1st range high around 464-465 area (possibly push for brief lows before starting to levitate higher as we wait on Fomc, seeing a large and quick consolidation during Fomc). Then chopping back toward 462 area and possibly pushing those boundaries lower at some point. 

2) Trange day (rounded reversal) we Head higher from open. Today revolves around the Fed so we just float up while waiting for 2pm then get a head fake around 467-468 before continuing lower to end the day.  

3) Trend up day structure.  we open gap up; we fade back toward the 463.36 area where we find support. After chopping sideways here we start the Fed float up until 2pm where we get a big and fast consolidation before finding the true direction.",12-15-2021

"new hereI have never traded options so I know this question may sound dumb, but trying to learn.

Say I buy the Tesla call option at $400 strike price expiring in March 2023 for roughly 50k. Current stock price sits at roughly $1000. I'm aware that liquidity will dry up if the stock continues to move upwards. So let's say Tesla climbs from $1000 today to $1800/share by March 2023 expiration. If there's no liquidity to sell the option in March, I would just exercise.

Can someone explain to me how this exercise plays out? Will I need to come up with 40k cash to buy the 100 shares at the $400 strike price or will the funds from the intrinsic value of the option cover this transaction?

Will the new stock be automatically purchased on the expiration date and the excess amount turn into cash in my portfolio?

Never done this. I appreciate your all's help",12-15-2021
"Can someone explain the selling at the money puts strategy?I watched this video yesterday https://youtu.be/tInTlMr2W9Q where this guy bought at the money puts for tesla for next year. And got the cash in his account instantly. He said he's doing this for cash flow and not capital gains. 

I'm wondering, what are the risks and how exactly does this work? 

My experience with options is simple calls and puts.",12-14-2021

"Amateur hour at RIVN?When new and potentially interesting stocks IPO (or meme stocks emerge), once their options appear I start tracking their Greeks and other stats with 15-minute data to see how they track. I did this with RIVN on its first day of options trade and was shocked to see the premiums at one of the highest IV levels that I have ever recorded (details at end).

So then I see that RIVN is reporting earnings after hours on Thur Dec 16. [Any of you who know me know that I heavily trade earnings strangles - this is NOT where this post is going - earnings strangles don't normally pay on young stocks nor meme stocks]. So I am considering writing covered calls on Wed, either at market open or just before close (premiums bloom up a little at O or C). I may also turn it into a collar by buying a distant OTM put.

This possible strategy, though, is not the point of this post. I normally go look at a company's investor relations page to get some perspective. I did that mid-day Sunday and I get the message ""This page is currently undergoing maintenance."" I had to laugh - that is pretty rinky-dink for a company that is trying to prove that it is a competitor for Tesla and the like. Anyway ..

For those of you still reading, here are some specs:

I capture and use implied DAILY volatility and label it IDV. I compare that to various measures of historical daily volatility (HDV). Annual measures of volatility would he about 16 times the daily measure if using a 252-day data year, to give some perspective.

The first log entry I have for RIVN is on Tue Nov 16 at 12:58 PM PST (2 minutes before market close), ATM Nov 19 180 Call, 170 Put (RIVN @ 174.47!!!), Call IDV was 0.1212, Put IDV was 0.11739. To give you some perspective on how insanely high this is, here are some comparisons for other securities, same day about the same time (all at the money, all Nov 19, showing call IDV only):

SPY 0.00542

IWM 0.009685

GME 0.03808

HOOD 0.02483  Note: HOOD Call IDV on Aug 4th: 0.1209 - so actually higher!!

On Friday at 11:45, ATM Dec 17 option IDVs were 112 Call 0.05806 and 110 Put 0.05576. BUT by Wed I expect these to be way up once again, and if so, I may do a collar (covered call plus cheap hedge). I used to do collars back in the crazy gold (GLD) mania and they were extremely profitable. So we will see, and I will post if I actually make a trade.

Meanwhile we monitor Investor Relations to see if that gets updated properly. If they can't complete a web page, can they complete a car?

Thought this might be of interest to some of you. [Edit: buncha stuff]",12-12-2021
"Expected moves this week. SPY, QQQ, IWM, BTC, ETH, TSLA, FDX .## The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** finished last week 3.5% higher (or about $16). That was more than the 2.4% (or $11) options were pricing for the week. Implied volatility fell sharply with the move higher in the market.

**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1.3% move (about $6 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY $471 that is a range of about $465 to $477.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 18, down sharply from 30 the prior week. That means expected moves quickly went from historically high to more in line with historical averages in a few days.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (Via Options AI)

* SPY **1.3%** (about $6)
* QQQ **1.8%** (about $5)
* IWM **2.5%** (about $5.50)
* DIA **1.4%** (about $5)

As mentioned last week:

*“If the market were to find footing implied volatility could quickly contract, although on some of the higher moves last week volatility stayed bid, as expectations for short-term swings remained high. The VIX is now in backwardation, meaning front month volatility is now slightly higher than outer months. But even outer months are historically high.”*

Volatility did quickly contract. The SPY ended the week up $16 but most bullish long premium strategies needed that large move higher with options already pricing an $11 move.

VIX futures are now back to a fairly steep contango after a brief spell of backwardation. December VIX futures dropped from 28.50 to 20, while Jan and Feb dropped from around 28 to about 23. May dropped from 27.50 to 25.50. Volatility assumptions for the next week few weeks are now lower than assumptions for January and beyond.

&#x200B;

## In the News

**Crypto**

Bitcoin enters the new week in about the same spot as last week, just below 50k. Options were pricing about an 8% move last week, it stayed in about a 5% range. Options are pricing about a 6.5% move this week (options expiring Friday the 17th), slightly less than last week. ETH options are implying about an 8% expected move this week.

**Tesla**

Tesla closed last week near the low end of its recent range. Options are implying about a 9% move into year end which corresponds to about $1100 on the upside and about $925 on the downside. *Via Options AI:*

## Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings

The *expected moves* link to the Options AI Calendar. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the prior quarter. Earnings announcements are light this week as we’re at the tail end of the earnings season.

*Thursday*

**Adobe** ADBE / [Expected Move: **5.3%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ADBE) / Recent moves: -3%, +3%, -2%

**FedEx** FDX / [Expected Move: **4.9%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FDX) / Recent moves: -9%, -4%, +6%

&#x200B;

With most earnings out of the way, markets will likely be focused on macro events and year end positioning for the next few weeks. With last week's quick compression in implied volatility near term options are no longer pricing the wild swings we saw the past few weeks but that could change quickly with any move lower. On the flipside, a stable market into year end might see options compress even more as options need to price in shorter holiday weeks.",12-12-2021

"DayTrading options taxes WorriedHey guys I know this topic might be boring for some since there are tons of same posts. But would love for someone to shed some light on my issue here. I'm a bit worried about the wash sale come taxes time next year and want to get ahead on the issue if theres anything I can do to avoid any headaches. Last September I started Day trading scalping a lot more day to day mostly Tesla, Apple, Spy options (buying puts/calls ) as well some tickers . Looking at my statement on TDameritrade shows the following:

YTD without Wash sale:

**Realized Book Capital Gain/Loss Report**

 01/01/2021 -- 12/08/2021 Entire Period 

Short-term gain 21,573.12 Long-term gain 0.00 

Short-term loss -39,945.56 Long-term loss 0.00 

Short-term net -18,372.44 Long-term net 0.00 

Short-term proceeds 1,673,117.14 Long-term proceeds 0.00 

Short-term cost 1,691,489.58 Long-term cost 0.00 

Short-term gain or loss adj 0.00 Long-term gain or loss adj 0.00

&#x200B;

**YTD with wash sale adjusted:**

01/01/2021 -- 12/08/2021 Entire Period 

Short-term gain 50,612.88 Long-term gain 0.00 

Short-term loss -68,985.32 Long-term loss 0.00 

Short-term net -18,372.44 Long-term net 0.00 

Short-term proceeds 1,673,117.14 Long-term proceeds 0.00 

Short-term cost 1,691,489.58 Long-term cost 0.00 

Short-term gain or loss adj 0.00 Long-term gain or loss adj 0.00 

I didn't have a capital gain of $50k through out the year, does it mean this will be added to my tax liability? I'm a bit worried looking at this, and the more I research about wash-sale the more confused I get. I currently don't hold any open positions as usually I close them same day,  I'm worried about day trading in Dec to avoid any more issues. Any help is really appreciated.",12-09-2021

"ZM is Looking GoodWhen I entered this community, I was here to learn more about options. Anytime I do anything, I'm obsessed with becoming a subject matter expert on it and have to consume everything. So while I feel I know enough to have an edge, my personal education will never end.

One thing I did learn quickly in this community. there are a tremendous amount of traders that simply don’t believe 5-10% returns a month are possible.

100% of my trades are verified by third parties as I have some business interests that are developing several of my methodologies into private funds. Those results aren’t for you. You’re welcome to believe they don’t even exist. It's lame that I even mention something that I'm not going to show you. But here we are.

Instead, I’ll just show you how I do it. I’m not going to sit here and display every single trade, but I’ll go over one at a time, until I’m tired of doing it or Reddit no longer is of interest to me.

I first look at market sentiment to decide how I’m going to approach the day. That’s about as simple as looking at the price action of SPY.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0tpmpfns75481.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc96d179be5d36f37cb5124a3b734791545a8497

Spy has been consistently moving up, so my overall bias is bullshit, but there are times when it naturally dips. During those times even though it’s an overall bull market, I take a more neutral stance on it.

My stance will ultimately determine what type of trade I’m going to take. In neutral to bull markets I will generally trade short straddles. In strong bull markets, l’ll trade naked puts. I don’t really get too funky on the more complex options strategies as they seem like they were more designed to get people to trade as opposed to helping people get profitable.

Once I have a market sentiment, I start paging through various charts. I screen looking for companies that most everyone else is trading. High volume, good volatility. I’m not against penny stocks, but you can get stuck in there with limited options and odd pricing at times if things go against you. I prefer $20 and above. Not upper limit for me. Though I’ve never traded anything higher than Tesla at this point.

Today the market really took off. However, gaps give me a sense of pause as gaps tend to close. They don’t always close but it would appear they do more times than not. So when I see a gap, I visualize it closing to get a better idea of sentiment. Because of today’s gap, I’m looking for stocks that are optimal for short strangles.

Let’s have a gander at ZM. It peaked my interest because while the rest of the market is enjoying some new gains today, ZM Is holding steady.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6iiv1zhv75481.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e8fcdd17bd542f92ea03155f681636d348cdb3

It’s been dropping lately. COVID is wearing off. People are getting back to work. Virtual conferencing wasn’t as vital as it was last year when ZM roared up to some impressive numbers. I think ZM is starting to settle into a valuation that makes sense for them. People once believed it was a $100 as well as believed it was a $580 stock.

If the stimulus didn’t happen, $580 would have never happened. But ZM would likely be doing better than not, so I’m comfortable looking at this to trade. It’s been going down, and by this analysis it may have found a current bottom for a new area of support, or it just might be a retracement up a bit before falling back down.

If it continues downward, I want to make sure I’m far away enough that it stays within the range of my short strangle. I don't believe it's going to be having some any impressive highs anytime soon.

January 21 2021 Options Chain is paying out some good premiums. I prefer looking 30-60 days out. I like low deltas. I’m not the guy chasing high returns and gambling. I like to be right way more than I’m wrong, but I also want to make sure I’m adequately protecting myself in the event I am wrong.

I’ll be selling a call at 250 and a put at 140. Giving me some delta neutrality and room for this guy to breath for the next month and a half.

Because I have a portfolio margin account, my cash collateral to secure this trade is significantly less than if I had a cash account or a regulation T account. I only have to put up $1737 to collect at least $385 in credits. That’s a ROI of over 20% on my money. That’s some good fucking returns.

Because of the higher premiums as well, it extends out my breakeven levels as well giving this trade even more room to breath.

So I’m going to take this trade and see what this bitch will do.

By the way, I’m not a financial advisor, though in my 30s I was. This isn’t financial advise. You’re a fucking moron to let a guy on Reddit make determinations of how you trade with your money that you worked hard for. It’s my interest however, not to have you worry about the specifics of the trade, but the process I took to arrive at that trade.

All that said, l trade for a living. I live a very comfortable lifestyle. I know my shit. I don't need to sell you shit. I earn 6.8% returns a month. Take it or leave it. My message is for those that want to hear.

We're all here to make money. So let's do just that.",12-07-2021

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* A sharp selloff in large technology companies dragged down stocks on Friday, capping off a week of wild swings in financial markets.
* Traders have had a lot to think about in the last few days, from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish stance to uncertainty about how the omicron coronavirus outbreak will affect global reopening.
* A mixed jobs report in the United States did nothing to avert another bout of intense volatility. The reason for this is that there is a widespread belief that the data will not be game-changers, with policymakers likely to accelerate the tapering of asset purchases in the face of elevated inflation.
* The stock market's weekly decline has been extended. Tesla fell about 6.5%, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms approached a bear market after a 19.7% drop from a recent peak. Apple fell after news broke that the phones of a number of US State Department employees had been hacked.
* China's companies listed in the United States fell amid plans by ride-hailing giant Didi Global to exit American exchanges and regulators' plans to force foreign firms to open their books or risk delisting.
* The US Treasury once again stopped from labeling any foreign economies as currency manipulators, while maintaining that Taiwan and Vietnam met all three criteria for the designation.

# Technical Analysis - 65 min

https://preview.redd.it/e2gxlcu80m381.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=81adfd7bc87a12505c39b2e5bc22f2b6c9ebee38

## Commentary:

* Reclaiming 450 support on the false breakout to the downside was the only positive for the Bulls to another brutal week.
* The 9 SMMA (450.77) has acted as a perfect dip buying opportunity (minus Sept.) throughout the year so it will be interesting to see how that plays out next week.
* I believe that the Bulls will attempt a run to 459-460 resistance level (pending more FUD news about the new covid variant, taper talks, etc.) early next week.
   * The first test will be the pivot at 455.67. Best case - they gap above the pivot level on Monday.
* If Bulls establish support above 462 resistance (on monthly chart) the Christmas rally will be back on the menu and we may test 470 and ATH.
* If 459-460 holds and Bears clear the 455.67 pivot they shall see 450 again. This would make it a triple bottom from Dec. 1.
   * I believe the third time will be the charm and they will finally breakthrough support (just too many macro headwinds IMO.)
* We have a pivotal week ahead of us!

## Levels:

* Support area: 449.67
* Pivot: 455.67
* Resistance - 460.04
* Bullish Targets: 463.39 - 466.98 - 469.68 - 471.21 - 473.78
* Bearish Targets: 446.88 - 443.43 - 439.88 - 436.39

**Strategies:**

* If Bullish - play to Resistance (460.04) and watch Pivot (455.67). Wait for Resistance break and successful Support test at 460 for more calls.
* If Bearish - short at Pivot (455.67) or Resistance (460.04) and play to Support, keeping an eye on Pivot for reversal to upside. Wait for Support break and successful Resistance test  at 449.67 for more puts.

## RSI - 65 min.

* Bears want to 33.91 - 26.83
* Bulls want to see 56.89 - 63.65+
* RSI slightly favors bears.

## SMMA Study - 1 Week

* Held the 20 SMMA for the week
* 20 SMMA is at 450.77
* The week of 10/4 we nicked the 15 SMMA at 426 .36
* **If we dip below 450.77 and and establish major resistance below that level we may test the 15 SMMA in the weeks ahead.**
* **The 15 SMMA is currently sitting at 440.33**

"The week ahead in options. Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, NIO, Zoom, and more.### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** was more or less unchanged on the week, up just 0.3%. Options had priced about a 1% move. SPY has remained range-bound between about $466 and just above $470 for the past 2 weeks. Since breaking out above $460 to start November it has been in a range of about $462 and $470.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 18, slightly higher on the week. That puts it just under its historical average.

"Puts on $LCID?Hey guys! I just broke down some stuff on LCID to see how much growth is being priced in and if there is any money to be made. Firstly LCID is expecting to deliver only 500 vehicles this year and is still trading at a 90billion dollar valuation. If we take a very bullish estimate on the stock we can expect the company to deliver about 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles by 2025. If we also factor in a decent expense ratio of 80%( which is about 10% higher than Tesla) and give it a big P/E ratio of about 100x we see that in 2025 the share price comes out to anywhere from about $21- 45$. 

I used a spreadsheet for this data and priced in every thing I could

So should we buy Puts on $LCID. This valuation seems outrageous even over the long term",11-21-2021

"Buying LEAPS CALL with Low DeltaThis theory does not go well with most options experts as low delta means a low chance of hitting strike price and OTM does not mimic price movement as much as ITM CALL options, which is the whole purpose of buying options. However, lower delta may mean lower premium paid, which allows us to buy into quality but expensive companies like Tesla or Alphabet. It also allows us to hold more contract with the same budget. And since maximium loss equals to the total premium price, it helps to lower the loss if the stock goes south.

"New and would like to work with $TSLA, also need adviceHey everyone, so i started doing options a couple months ago. My plan is to sell put options on Tesla ($TSLA) weekly until it gets to a price i am comfortable with to execute the trade. Then I want to sell call options once i have the shares and set them for the friday of the week i am doing it. If the stock passes the strike price i set, i plan on selling put options the following week with a strike price that is less than what i sold them for so i never hit a loss. Can i get some advice on doing so or any insight whatsoever? Also is there something that i am missing in my plan? I am about to graduate from college and was thinking this would be a great way to pay off my student loans fast. Please comment anything that might be helpful to my plan above. Thank you",11-18-2021

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks slumped on fears that rising inflation may jeopardize the global economic recovery, prompting central banks to raise interest rates sooner than expected. treasuries rose.
* Traders took some risk off the table as data revealed a slowdown in new home development in the United States, implying that builders are struggling to break ground on projects due to high material prices and continued labour shortages. Target Corp. fell after warning that cost pressures are increasing, fueling fears that inflation may eat into retailer profitability. The NASDAQ 100, which is heavy on technology, beat key indexes, spurred by a rally in tech titans Apple and Tesla.
* According to GS' CEO Solomon markets may face a rough period as the economy attempts to recover from the rapid impact of the epidemic. If interest rates rise, it will ""take some of the euphorias out of some markets,"" he said in an interview at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore.
* The worst quarter for the S&P 500 since the pandemic appears to have scared off some do-it-yourself investors. According to the SEC and market data compiled by major newswire Intelligence, the retail trading surge that began with lockdowns has now subsided, with total equity volume from individual investors falling to 19% in the third quarter, down from 24% at the start of the year.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* On Monday, stocks struggled to find direction amid extreme volatility in Tesla Inc. and a jump in bond yields.
* Major equity indexes recovered from session lows as Tesla reduced losses after entering a bear market with a nearly 20% drop from a record. Earlier in the day, the company plummeted when CEO Elon Musk suggested selling more of his shares. 
* Treasuries fell on concern that the Federal Reserve may have to reduce asset purchases more quickly following the fastest inflation in three decades.
* Following a year marked by unrelenting stock gains and a bond selloff, analysts have begun pitching their calls for 2022, with the spectre of inflation looming big in investors' minds. 
* Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson anticipates the S&P 500 to fall to 4,400 in the next 12 months, a 6% decrease from Friday. While profits are expected to expand further, he warns that a slowing economy and the withdrawal of Fed assistance would likely put pressure on valuations.
* It's the third week of the month when most equity options expire, and the event has regularly jolted equities this year. **While history is not always a reliable indication, the S&P 500 has reported a 1% increase – in either direction – in six of the last eight expiration weeks, according to data provided by a major news wire.**
* According to Janus Henderson investors, worldwide dividends just had their best-ever third quarter, putting them on track to surpass their pre-pandemic peak by the end of 2021. The money manager boosted its projection for total payouts to $1.46 trillion this year, citing stronger balance sheets and optimism about the future, indicating a speedier comeback to an all-time high than projected in its previous report.
* This week's attention will be on consumer strength, with retail sales expected to accelerate on Tuesday and industry titans such as Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. reporting quarterly results. Strong merchandise expenditure should continue to put a strain on global supply systems, which are already struggling to keep up.
* Even if hopes for a breakthrough on big issues are low, Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will have much to talk about during their first virtual summit, including sanctions to Taiwan. According to a Biden administration official, the virtual summit, which begins at 7:45 p.m. on Monday night in Washington, will span many hours, including translation for both leaders in their third conversation this year.

"Expected Moves this Week, TSLA, NVDA, LCID, HD, and more.### The Broader Markets

**Last Week –** **SPY** was more or less unchanged on the week. Options had priced about a 1% move.

**This Week – SPY** options are once again pricing about a 1% move (a little less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY about **$467.50**, that corresponds to just above **$472** on the upside and around **$463** on the downside.

**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.50, basically unchanged on the week. Its high of the week came on Wednesday, around 19.50.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1%**
* QQQ **1.5%**
* IWM **1.7%**
* DIA **1.2%**

### In the News

Elon Musk followed through on last week’s promise to sell shares. He was once again on Twitter this weekend implying he has more to sell. Tesla options are pricing about a 6% move for the upcoming week and about 15% into year-end. That 15% expected move into year-end is near the recent highs and near the levels the stock broke out from about a month ago. Here’s a look at an example condor set at those levels, risking a little less than $7 to make a little more than $3 if the stock were to stay within the range of $830 and $1230:

"Tesla PCS both legs slightly OTM and 1 day leftMy Tesla put credit spread is 1050/1030 expiring tomorrow. TSLA is currently at around 1060. This is the first time in my PCS both legs are this close to being ITM. What should I do tomorrow if (1) TSLA stays flat for most of the day and (2) TSLA drops further? In the 2nd case, I am thinking of rolling it out. For the 1st case where TSLA stays flat, there's a great chance that both legs will be OTM by the end of the day; I know people suggest that don't let the option expires, but usually when do you close it? Like 30 mins - 1h before the market closes? Currently the price of the PCS is \~$4 while I only got $2 credit when I sold it, and I'm trying to see if I can avoid a lost here.",11-11-2021

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* After a selloff in the previous session due to expectations that high inflation might necessitate tighter monetary policy, US shares gave back their gains on Thursday.
* The S&P500 rose less than 0.1%, powered by advances in materials and technology, after plunging 0.8% on Wednesday, its largest drop in more than a month. Tesla Inc. changed after papers revealed that CEO Elon Musk liquidated $5 billion in stock. Meanwhile, Walt Disney Co. and Beyond Meat Inc. both fell after reporting disappointing quarterly results.
* The US cash treasury market was closed for a holiday.
* Investors are ready for monetary policy adjustments sooner rather than later, as higher-than-expected consumer prices have delivered a setback to assertions that inflation is transitory. Inflationary pressures may drive the Fed to taper at a faster rate or raise interest rates sooner than expected if inflation remains high. Simultaneously, equities are nearing all-time highs as robust earnings and economic growth prospects force the stock market higher.
* Oil struggled to find a direction as investors assessed the likelihood that the White House would interfere to cool prices. Gold was approaching a five-month high. Stocks rose in Europe, while Chinese equities rose in Asia on anticipation that the government will lessen its standoff with property developers. The dollar was stronger against its major counterparts.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* As treasuries rose, US stocks paused their longest advance since 2017, bringing key indexes lower from all-time highs.
* The S&P 500 index dipped for the first time in nine sessions, driven by a decrease in banking stocks, which were hit by a drop in the 10-year yield, which fell to its lowest level in seven weeks. Following a tweet by investor Michael Burry, Tesla dropped as much as 13%.
* PayPal dropped after the company's guidance fell short of expectations. General Electric soared after announcing that it would be split into three businesses.
* Investors are weighing robust earnings, easing travel restrictions and US infrastructure expenditure against the possibility of sustained inflation, which might lead to tighter monetary policy. The producer price index rose in October, adding to concerns about inflationary pressures in the economy.
* On Wednesday, new consumer price data could contribute to the monetary policy debate, which saw another surprise on Tuesday with reports that Fed's Brainard was interviewed by Biden as he considers whether to re-appoint Fed's Powell.
* In the meantime, positioning adjustments have spurred advances in long-end Treasuries, bringing the 30-year yield to its lowest level since July. The yield on the US 10-year note has dropped to 1.44%.
* After rising beyond $68,000 for the first time, bitcoin's gains were trimmed back. After a bearish report, crude oil jumped more than 3% in New York. Gold Rose.

🌝NightMan",11-09-2021
"I analyzed 1,000+ IPO's over the last two decades to find out the best time to buy an IPO! Here are the results!Given the growing hype surrounding the [$65 Billion Rivian IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/rivian-raises-ipo-price-range-and-could-now-be-worth-up-to-65-billion.html) \[1\], I felt this is the perfect time to follow up on my [first analysis on IPOs](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/can-you-make-money-from-ipos?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web). In the previous analysis, we realized that the majority of gains were made from the listing itself and those who invested on listing day gained a measly 1.3%. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0muyh67gbky71.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=caf6db08273205fb2e2d86d5977a772b95a6faa6)

In most cases, [less than 10% of the total IPO](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price) is allocated to retail investors. Adding to this, a multitude of other factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not in the end \[2\].

Given that the chances of you making it into the IPO allotment are bleak, what I wanted to analyze is, if we miss the IPO bus,

**What is the best time to buy into a recently IPO’d stock?**

Should it be on the listing day itself or should you wait a day, week, or even a month for all the hype surrounding the IPO to die down and the stock to come back to its “real” valuation \[3\]?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8lcm7qchbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=d76f4f6a2902d88fd4eeb614d4d29a4231877144)

**Data**

I have leveraged the same data source (iposcoop.com) that I used last time. They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.

The stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/i0qp7kdhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=110867d59c8346b1e3f1078affe60ac3e752eb1f)

**Analysis**

Since the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after

1. One day
2. One week
3. One month

The returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPO’d. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!

https://preview.redd.it/6uzzc6dhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96457e42228d1c17e40a5081f856d81959f4982

 **Results** 

[ All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  ](https://preview.redd.it/yi23mapjbky71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=be4aeccefdd084f92a071f047aed62f7938ec668)

Surprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average **the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself**. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!

But what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/j5yu28qkbky71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8fd218f14d640fed25cefe8d586c8786ecd8525)

If you are a long-term investor, **you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week**, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only ***decrease your overall return.***

So if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!

Now, let’s compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bvvov5olbky71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=81c5449fe6b5bcb3824d23ce3cfe690e5cfc17c1)

IPOs’ returns on average ***beat the market*** over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.

Now it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPO’s in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/14fodwdhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=d515dcc6d1ad6600ac2596cfb10bbeeb4135004d)

**Limitations**

The above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy

1. The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 \[4\]. I don’t think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.
2. Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.
3. Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a6afrmehbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f67a849e47f6d4002a91773eea79c3a91851edf)

**Conclusion**

Buying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, it’s still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.

As I [explained in my last post on IP](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/can-you-make-money-from-ipos)O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless it’s a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) \[5\].

Whatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as it’s listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!

Analysis Sheet containing all the data: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqRNZEsTfgG6f8GfI-n6qBAai9wrUA47hFMYg6tz098/edit?usp=sharing)

Until next week…

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The company has [only built and delivered 56](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) vehicles as of Oct21. If Rivian IPO’d at $65 Billion, it means that each vehicle it delivered added more than $1 Billion in value to its shareholders. A similarly valued Ford delivered 4.1 Million vehicles in 2020. Truly wild times we are living in!

\[2\] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - [In the case of TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.

\[3\] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to \~$310.

\[4\] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.

\[5\] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280) showcasing that IPO’s are usually undervalued while [others argue](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF) that IPOs are overvalued. I guess you can twist data however you want to tell your story.

"I was an emotional traderOver the last month, I've lost all of my earnings, and it's turned me into an emotional trader. I've had a roller coaster ride with options, but lately, I've lost a lot of money in the last month that I'm dead inside and don't think I'll ever be able to trade logically again without being hampered by emotions.

As an example, around March I sold my Tesla shares for $300 less than what I paid for it. However, Tesla stock soared afterward, and if I hadn't used my paper hand, I would have been getting greens by around 40%.

My problem was that I didn't plan ahead of time before initiating a deal. I really just have emotion to bargain with. Before entering any trade-in, I should've had an exit strategy in place and established what I was seeking to achieve and being realistic. Any advice on how to be less emotionally invested in your trades would be appreciated...",11-09-2021
"I SPY TA - Tuesday Nov. 9, 2021# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* After corporate earnings, good hiring data, and a covid treatment breakthrough boosted optimism in the world's largest economy, US equities crept higher, with the S&P 500 recording its longest winning run since 2017. The value of the dollar and treasuries decreased.
* For the eighth session in a row, the S&P 500 climbed 0.1% powered by energy producers and materials, as investors flocked into firms that profit the most from a healthy economy. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 plummeted, weighed down by Tesla Inc.'s 4.9% drop after Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock, to which they responded positively.
* Last week's news flow, which included the passing of a $550 billion infrastructure bill, washed away concerns that high inflation and the Federal Reserve's intention to reduce asset purchases would disrupt economy. The results of Pfizer Inc.'s viral therapy, as well as the easing of US travel restrictions, have fueled anticipation that corporations will continue to report excellent earnings.
* However, the recent rate of increases may make it difficult for stocks to move much higher in the absence of a new trigger.
* On Wednesday, markets will be watching a measure of US consumer pricing intently after advances in US payrolls last week revealed an increase in average hourly earnings.
* Oil fell to $82 a barrel in New York after the United States suggested it may reveal measures to lower oil and gasoline costs as soon as this week. Meanwhile, European gas and power costs have risen on fears that Russia may not fulfill the supply boost promised by Putin.
* In Europe, the Stoxx 600 remained almost unchanged.

"Why is TSLA so popular?Someone asked me a good question this morning: Why is trading Tesla so popular? It’s one of the most (if not the most) popular retail trading stocks. Always has killer premarket volume, great morning volatility. 

Is it simply by chance, because something has to be popular, and this is where everyone inadvertently came together? What do you think.",12-26-2023
"I'm a professional money manager and this is what I'm watching/ expecting for the week ahead.  
**Some Expectations:**

* Low volume during the week due to Holiday season. 
* Nothing really on economic calendar this week at all + low volume = expectation of relatively flat movement.
* No major headwinds so unlikely to see big correction this week, from a fundamental perspective. 
* Next real significant economic development will be the FOMC minutes on 3rd of Jan, and even that will probably send the dollar lower, pushing markets higher.  So not expecting sustained correction in the very near term.
* Likelihood is that any dips will be bought and market will remain around current levels for now.   


**A look at some of the Options data to reinforce these expectations:**  


* EURUSD Skew at highest level of the year. Traders continue to bet that EURUSD will breakout. I personally had 1.10 as a price target on EURUSD but the active 1.11 strike tells us traders want 1.11.   
[https://imgur.com/a/xRK9bWq](https://imgur.com/a/xRK9bWq)    
The lack of data this week and risk reversal on DXY falling, pointing to continued drop in dollar means I won’t be surprised if 1.11 hits.   

* SPX skew is relatively flat. This tells us traders are not expecting a big move in either direction. Simply due to the fact of so little being on the economic calendar.   
Skew has lowered a bit, due to spike in VIX, but weak dollar means that volatility is not lasting in markets.  
Tells us dips are likely to be bought.  
   
[https://imgur.com/a/LHI1Srn](https://imgur.com/a/LHI1Srn)    

* Slight weakness in DOW Skews vs SPX skews. More hedging activity there. So if there is likely to be any weakness, Dow will probably underperform other indexes.   

* Tesla EXPECTATIONS FROM Skews (just because I know the retail audience Loves Tesla):  
Bullish imbalance tells us sentiment is positive around Tesla. But the bullish skews lowered, so probably see some chop this week. May move higher after Year End.  
[https://imgur.com/a/2DkrGYP](https://imgur.com/a/2DkrGYP)    

* NVDA EXPECTATIONS FROM SKEWS:  
500 Gamma wall seems a strong resistance, unlikely to break in short term.   

* ***Fun fact, is the first time since 1997 that not a single company will report earnings during the last week of the year.***   


  
**——— CALENDAR/ CATALYSTS ——**   
**MONDAY:**  


* The only thing I was watching today was my Yorkshire puddings, to make sure my brother in law didn’t steal them.   

* Ueda was talking earlier, with key highlights being that he said the prospect of achieving sufficient inflation rate isn’t enough yet and stressed the uncertainty involved. Said cannot predetermine when to raise policy.   
Most of this is already known to the market, so no real movement in USDJPY   


**TUESDAY: (Boxing Day, so bank holiday for many countries. Expected to see low volume):**  


* US House Price index - Will probably show a MOM change of around 0.8% imo. 
* US 2 year auction - Will probably send 2 year yields lower, with better than expected demand.   


**WEDNESDAY:**  


* JAPAN - BOJ will release their version of the fed minutes, from the meeting where they dovishly held rates stable, against expectations of a hike. My expectation is that this will probably send JPY lower as they reinforce their commitment to ultra easy. USDJPY to prop up  

* US - 5 year auction. Similar expectation to the 2 year auction the day before.   


**THURSDAY**:  


* JAPAN - Retail sales.   

* US - Jobless claims - Expectation for it to come out slightly under forecast, due to Holiday seasonality.   


**FRIDAY:**  


* SPAIN - inflation Rate preliminary reading for December. Significant as Spain CPI tends to be a leading indicator of Eurozone CPI.   
",12-26-2023
"I'm a professional (news driven) trader and these are some of my notes from premarket  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn’t much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion.   

* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what’s not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn’t much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it’s hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn’t to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren’t fortune tellers, especially when there’s little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn’t put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**

* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday’s post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you’d have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here.

**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
* One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It’s a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
PCE revisions too
* note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won’t move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* **US Jobless Claims**  
————

**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession “materialises”.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don’t follow other markets, it’s interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
————— 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

* SUGGESTION FROM LOCAL CHINESE NEWSPAPER THAT CHINA LARGE BANKS WILL CUT DEPOSIT RATES ON FRIDAY by 10 BPS and 20 BPS respectively on 1 and 2 year.   
That will encourage less saving and more spending. Its a stimulating measure. Has been done before and in reality won’t change that much but its a step in right direction.   

* PBOC COMMITS TO KEEP LIQUIDITY AMPLE. This comes as their FDI came out weak, down 10% YOY for 2023.

"I really don't understand/vent.I hear everyone talk about having a plan and they follow but I don't even know where to begin, everything is so volatile in the market.  I'm trying to do supply demand zones but when I think it is correct it isn't.  I'm just frustrated, and yes i lost a little bit a money today but lost a lot on paper.  Mainly just angry that I don't have anything that is black and white and I don't see how to develop something so black and white.  And yes I'm mainly posting this to get out my frustration with this week.

I'll give an example, today TSLA I put in a Call for 255 from the beginning leg up. Waited for it to come down, it did bought the call and took profit.  This also worked for MSFT for me today as well.

https://preview.redd.it/n8c6adxgai7c1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c7fbce9242c0bb488a7a49e4106ca648353980

But man my play on SPX ate me alive,  I was looking to buy the call when it dipped only for it to blow down past it and keep going.  I am not sure what else to look at to help.  I mean did anyone else see the sell off?  Is SPX not something good to apply to this strategy (sorry about that)

"20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.**

* When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn’t appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there’s not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance.
* Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there’s still uncertainty as to how long it can.
* For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again.
* I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down.
* *I will now continue with the normal posts:*

**What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:**

* Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement.
* From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat.
* Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst.
* My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130.

&#x200B;

* ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don’t can skip.***
* Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI
* Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts.
* Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022.
* Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging.

**————— EARNINGS ————**

* FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good.
* EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters.
* Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024
* Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3%
* Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading.
* Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher.

**————— DATA LEDE —————**

* **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat.
* This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday’s drop.
* **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly.
* This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years.
* MOM move was deflationary.
* This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before.
* **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this.
* **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower.

**———— FOREX ————**

* GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought.
* Yen doing some price correction after yesterday’s move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP
* Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today’s inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon.

**——— MARKETS —————**

* DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open.
* SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower.
* GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today.
* UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets.
* NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue
* HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77%
* Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though.
* Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it’s only marginally lower so likely to have no impact.  10y lowest since July

**————— OPTIONS ————**

* GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot.

**————  INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ————**

* Didn’t read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here’s what I did read.
* DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast.
* Bank of America’s fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains.
* Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later.
* Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts.
* Unicredit - “Current enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely”. Positives are priced in.

**——MAG 7 NEWS ( CAN MOVE MARKETS) ——**

* Generally flat, so the headlines outlined below are not considered big enough to have a market moving impact.
* **AAPL** \- financial impact of the smartphone ban not likely to be as severe as some first thought. Dan Ives estimates it to be about a $400m impact to sales over Holiday period. Is a drop vs their revenue.

"I'm a professional trader and this is some of my notes on what's been happening in premarket.Note: I tried to take on some of the feedback from yesterdays post and provide a bit more analysis, although I keep some more back for my personal notes. Hopefully you can find value in this post though.

**What happened yesterday, and thoughts on this:**

* Yesterday, SPX and Nasdaq made marginally new highs, whilst Dow was flat. This despite fed officials continuing to try to walk back rate cut optimism.
* This move higher in SPX and Nasdaq was driven by Mag7 again, with exception of Apple and Tesla. We can see the mag7 dominance by the fact that QQQ rose by 0.43%, whilst QQQEqualweight was down for much of the day.
* Oil was higher on Red Sea disruption, particularly after BP said they would not be using the Red Sea Routes after Houthi attacks. This forces them through the Suez Canal which delays oil shipments by 2 weeks on average.
* Steel stocks pumped after Nippon Steel agree deal for X, although Senator Fetterman says he intends to try to stop the deal.
* Solar stocks notable losers as Sunpower raises doubts over its ability to continue as going concern, which dragged other Solar stocks lower.
* Vix remained suppressed around 12 which is supporting the market higher.

**My Thoughts:**

* Personally seeing signs that the market is topped out. Saw Tesla reached resistance near 260 but got rejected. NVDA now trading at 500, which I think is a psychological level that sellers will be sitting at, so would expect it to get rejected there over next few days. Apple trading near 200, which I think will be a psychological level sellers will be at. To be honest, I would have expected Apple to be down more than 0.85% with news of Apple Watch sales being paused and China accelerating their Apple ban in government institutions.
* Snapchat got a very bullish analyst upgrade but was flat on the day, which can be a sign madcaps are topping out too after a very bullish run.
* Nasdaq (IXIC, not NDX) now coming close to 15k which will see sellers sitting there.
* Other than lack of headwinds in the market in coming days in terms of data, I think market is close to key resistance levels.

**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:BOJ RATES DECISION - recall from previous reddit post, my expectation was for BOJ to hold rates despite speculation of possible hike.**

* Made no change to negative interest rate, holding benchmark at -0.1%Yield curve control unchanged.
* People had speculated that they would tighten which pumped up yen. Yen to now retrace those gains.
* BOJ spoke of “extremely high uncertainties” and said more needs to be seen to determine if “positive wage inflation cycle is in place”.
* Seeing gradual improvement in inflation but still not in a position to be sufficiently confident.
* Didn’t remove the rhetoric about “won’t hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary”. Thats quite dovish

**ANALYSIS:**BEFORE SPECULATION THAT BOJ WOULD TIGHTEN, USDJPY WAS TRADING AT 147.22JXY was trading at 68.Probably needs to retrace close to back to this.As Yen falls, Japanese equities going to become cheaper, so Nikkei will likely pump for few days now.

&#x200B;

**AUSTRALIA RBA MINUTES - For meeting where RBA went back to pausing after hiking again last month.**

* Board considered whether to raise rates by 25 bps or to keep steady. Decided on pause.
* Will continue to analyse the data to determine future policy.
* Some encouraging signs on inflation that need to continue.

**ANALYSIS**:Not much to these comments to be honest. Continued data driven rhetoric.**US** 

**BUILDING PERMITS AND HOUSING STARTS DATA COMING.**

**———— FX ——————**

* Yen lower, propping up USDJPY. USDJPY was trading at 147 before speculation of tightening. Since that didn’t materialise, USDJPY needs to retrace.
* Money rotating out of yen into other currencies like AUD, GBP etc
* Note Risk reversal on dollar index has touched lowest since 2020, and options pointing to substantial drop in USD. This would support equity markets.
* Note: Dollar and US equities are most inversely correlated since May - Can watch for some correction there.

**———— OPTIONS —————**

* 4800 remains sticky strike
* Record Call skew - Bullish.
* Single Digit implied Vol
* CTAs moving supporting on Brent Crude now - algorithmic strategies supporting oil

**——— MARKETS OVERVIEW ———**

* Markets: Flat as you would expect in premarket when they are trading at all time highs and there’s little macro catalysts to drive them notably higher right now.
* NIKKEI: Japanese stocks pumping after ultra easy monetary policy maintained for foreseeable future. Makes yen lower and Japanese equities cheaper
* GER40:Majority of sectors slightly green.
* HKG50: NOTE: I’m holding positions in the HKG50. I think it’s undervalued and people will rotate from US equities into HKG at some point.
* OIL: Flat this morning after pushing yday, although it did pare those gains when US said they will help to safeguard Red Sea vessels. Launched a task force. This reduces risk premium and made oil fall again.Yields: Flat, slightly lower

**——— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ———**

* PIMCO SAYS THEY THINK UK WONT ACHIEVE SOFT LANDING. Said they are betting against GBP. Said UK consumers feeling brunt of interest rates more than US as less on 30 year fixed mortgages.
* MS’s MIKE WILSON SAYS US EQUITIES HAVE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE HIGHER. - Another Bear capitulates. To be honest, I see this as a sign of market topping out too.
* GOLDMAN releases paper saying UST yields are higher in short term, but near historical averages. Bullsh\*t report really. They’re high, lets be real. Highest since 2005.
* GOLDMAN’s SENTIMENT INDICATOR TICKED UP TO 1.1. Points to stretched equity positioning. Due a correction.

**——— Company Specific ————**

* SEDG - Downgraded at Piper Snalder to neutral, price target at 105 (which is 15% above spot)
* RUN - Piper Sandler upgraded to overweight, raising price target to 31 , 72% above spot. Because RUN is more sensitive to cutting rates

HEICO:Will read during the day. Is too pumped up right now and I was hoping for a correction aftermarket. Didn’t come so not an immediate priority to read before market open. Wont be buying it at these prices.I just read a short overview with summary that aerospace product demand was strong, and acquisitions helped to fuel their growth. Without acquisitions, still 12% organic sales growth though. So strong performance.

"Day trading TSLA using TSLL 1.5x leveraged ETF?Hi all, I'm wondering if anyone here day trades TSLA with the TSLL 1.5x leveraged ETF and if that is a good and manageable trade when momentum is upward, like in the past few months.

I haven't really traded leveraged ETFs, but I know you shouldn't hold them overnight -- is that right?

I've also seen 2x or 3x leveraged ETFs -- are they harder to trade than a 1.5x leveraged ETF? 

Anyone know if there will be a 2x or 3x Tesla ETF?

"Wash Sales explained for dummies.I'll make it quick, and dumbed down. This information is for day traders.
If you trade futures this doesn't apply to you. 

Stocks/Options traders listen the fuck up.

- Wash sales only matter in December-January prior to that trade as much as you want there are no issues.

Ok Now it's December, the way wash sales work is we as day traders make 100's of trades a year and that adds up. Let's say you day trade tesla all the time and you're up 5k overall.

Your taxes will look something

Gains on tesla : +45,000. 
Losses on Tesla: -40,000. 

For an overall profit of 5000 dollars, across all your trades.

Simple so far right? 

Now if you STOP trading  December 1st OR January 1st for 30 days your losses will count and you just pay taxes on your $5000 gain.

The only way Wash sales can screw you is if you keep trading into the next year without stopping, this will carry your losses over to the next year. The reason this is bad is because now it looks like you made a profit of 45k on tesla and have to pay taxes on whats known as ""phantom gains"". Your losses carry over and you can use them, but you're stuck with a huge tax bill that is above what you actually made. 

Long story short.
December 1st STOP trading anything you want to realize losses on.
I prefer December over January because of the holidays, but feel free to choose the month.

The only way around this is to have ""tax trader status"" which is somewhat hard to get, you need to trade everyday and apply to the IRS etc. If you're a new trader you will not get this.

that's it.. don't overcomplicate it.

Set an alert for December and don't worry about it till then.",09-25-2023
"Trading with leverage on stocks.So, I’ve been trading for about almost a year now. I’ve continuously lost trading options. A few times along my journey I did manage to have some green months. I’m thinking of switching to strictly trading equity with 2x leverage. I’m thinking of starting with $2000 and going all in on each trade with a max stop loss of 3%. Mainly trading Tesla. 

I know many are against going “all in” here, but you got to spend money to make money in this game. I’m down overall about $12,000. I know that money is as good as gone. I know how options work, but seem to be for the most part a losing game at least for me. It seems like it is much harder to manage risk on them, as you can be down 30-50% in a matter of minutes with no guarantee of recovery. At least with shares I feel risk would be easier for me to manage. Open to any feedback or criticism here.",09-24-2023
"Turning to this community for adviceI'll try my best to not make this a low-level post and rant, but more so just the trading community to help out a trader. 

I cannot seem to get mild or big wins. I trade Spy 0dte mostly and have gotten good at entries and saw some decent profit. Thats the thing, it's decent profit. I can make 10-20% almost no problem, and i end up selling for very little gains. The next thing is I set stop losses around 25% but EVERYTIME i get stopped out, it reverses. So what do i do next? 

Well i hold longer, but what happens is it never returns it keeps plummeting then im down 40-50%...now we're nearing losing more than winning because of this. Just yesterday I made like $20 when it could've been $2k all because i took my dinky profit and got stopped on the last few cons. 

This has resulted me in losing **a lot** of money. I know The Strat very well, I know basic ICT, but holy fuck it's all going against me. I'm really at my wits end. While writing this I had a Tesla con and made 15%, but its well over ITM now. Almost a 3x return and i made like $12. I don't know what the fuck to do anymore, i can't hold a decent win.

Before you come at me for saying ""Stop going for the home run, Stop trading 0dte"" I've been a base hit guy for a while, hence why i take 10-20%. Spy offers cons daily that go from .60 -> 1.30+ the profit is there, I just don't know how to be on the winning end of max profit. 

I've currently started reading Best Loser Wins to try and get some sort of nugget I'm missing in my trading. I feel like I'm starting to spiral. 

Considering stopping 0dte, but how the hell can i start maximizing more profit in general? Runners stay getting stopped out, or stopped out of the trade altogether. ",09-07-2023
Is this a good trading strategy?So I have been paper trading for about a year now. I spend maybe 3 - 5 hrs a day practicing different strategies. I have a lot of money (about 100k) im willing to put into my profile. And from what I have gathered from my experience is that I don't do well with holding trades. I like to get in and out fast. I trade popular stocks like TESLA and apple. (Edit) Before trading like this I was on a losing streak for about 9 months. I couldn't handle holding even with paper money and would always sell out early and just waste everything on commission. Now off one trade I make about 70 dollars or lose 40. I do have stop losses but never really use them I always trade out early. Per day I average 300. I rarely lose money. Is this at all what it would be like in a real life trade? Is this manageable?,08-26-2023

"Which of these two situations would make you feel worse?I'm just curious to get a perspective from other Day traders, and I'm curious how their minds perceive things.

Scenario 1: You buy 500 shares of Tesla at $200 and the stock is running up, eventually hits 202 and you are afraid you will lose your profits so you close it for a profit of $1000. The stock then continues to run and even goes as high as 210 and you missed out on a potential $5000 profit.


Scenario 2: You buy 500 shares of Tesla at 200 the stock is now trading at 202, and you are up $1000. You decide to be disciplined and let your profits run, but later on the stock goes back to your entry and you close the position for break even. $0 in profit.


Of these two scenarios which one would feel worse for you if you went through them?",07-29-2023
"Doing the wrong thing can reward you.One of the most annoying parts of trading is doing the ""wrong"" thing can reward you sometimes leading to repetition of stupid behaviors. Let me give you an example.

You buy Tesla at $200 for a day trade, it goes to 199.. 198.. etc so you average down, eventually tesla rebounds and runs back up to 200 and what was a red trade is now green because you ""averaged down"". The problem is across many many trades this will lead to failure. You rarely if ever average down on a day trade, you're supposed to do the exact opposite actually and that's average up when the trade is going your way, the market sadly sometimes rewards incorrect behaviors leading traders to think they made the right choice. 

One of the hardest thing I had to learn is being green on red rules is DETRIMENTAL to your career, if you are green but broke your rules you are not green in fact I would classify it as worse than red because you just reinforced bad behaviors.

The entire game is psychology, and once that clicked trading became so much easier.",07-26-2023
"Google/ Microsoft earnings and FOMC Day… 7-25-23 SPY/ ES FUTURES and QQQ Daily Market AnalysisThis was yet again another snoozefest of a day… I looked for some setups and was really unable to find anything A+ set up wise after noon today. Tough day of trading and a long day at that… markets ran up on momentum.

As of right now MSFT is sitting red on its earnings… overall not a terrible earnings from MSFT despite the redness…. A beat on Revenue and on EPS… kind of surprising seeing MSFT down here but this is what Tesla did also… 

**GOOG**

Google with a massive and impressive beat here… Overall google calls are going to absolutely print. With a big beat here on Google it will be interesting to see if this is the boost that tech needed. 

**FOMC**

As of right now it is a 98.9% odds that we get a 25bps rate hike tomorrow… so it is safe to say that we with certainty will get a 25bps hike tomorrow as the market is expecting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pjlvetqva6eb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef46e9f47ecd5f563d813202d1754f0efe81b30f

Now what really matters is what JPOW has to say for next FOMC meeting in September. Now keep in mind these few things… we KNOW as of right now according to Cleveland fed nowcast that inflation next month will increase… now the question and what we don’t know as of right now is that a one off rebound or is this the bottom for a long time? 

My thoughts are that JPOW gives the same old same old speech about being data dependent and that we are likely to have a “live” September meeting. If JPOW leaves it that way and also reassures us that banks are strong and what not (basically the same old same old) I believe we see a rally post FOMC. However, if JPOW even hints at having thought about a 50bps or comes in hawkish on next meeting with inflation then we could see a pretty bearish reaction to this data. 

I think markets will continue to front run tomorrows fomc as the last hike for a long time.

After we put a new demand in yesterday we finally are seeing our breakout from the 452.1 to 454.21 consolidation. That would favor that this is the start of a run up. Now of course we have FOMC tomorrow and that could be a bit of a game changer depending on what JPOW has to say… but as of now I am expecting a breakout. 

It is notable that SPY did fail to break through 456.82 supply. That is our next major resistance to break through and close over… if we do then our next target is 461.48 and then 466.05. I am bullish on SPY currently with 460+ being my ultimate target. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 447.02 -> 454.21 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 452.1 -> 466.05

Much like SPY we have a new daily demand yesterday on futures and we did finally break out of this 4595 to 4563 consolidation. With this breakout, bounce off daily 8ema support, extreme bull momentum on weekly and daily with a daily DMI move up… I am bullish and I do expect us to continue to push to the 4600+ area into next week. 

Next key resistance and level to watch is 4621. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4595 ->4621 -> 4667  
 Demand- 4563 -> 4653

Tech attempted to show some bullish strength today but actually end up showing slight weakness EOD. Now with a big google beat and depending on what MSFT does after hours we could finally see a huge move up on the Qs tomorrow and into the EOW. 

We did finally also get our new daily demand put in at 376.29 on Q today… This then gives us an upside target of 385.73… but my ultimate target for the EOW is 388.47 to 389.92. 

After we break out and close over 389.92 my ultimate target is 400-401.83. 

We also have a daily DMI Wave up starting on QQQ which supports further upside. 

As long as bulls continue to defend 376.29 I only see consolidation and/ or upside. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 385.73 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 376.29 -> 400.01

The VIX once again attempted to push up here. However, today we actually saw the VIX despite holding green almost all day close red. We did once again fail to close over the daily 20ema and over the supply level at 14. 

The VIX likely will see a sell off tomorrow post fomc which should give us a new supply off todays candle high at 14.03… that would also break this red bull channel on the VIX and should also give spy/ qqq further upside.

Today was another boring day of trading for me. I got stopped out on a call as you see this morning and then I took another call around noon that end up being stopped out at breakeven. After that I honestly never saw anything that looked suitable for entry. 

Today we ended up moving up purely on momentum. However, this was not quite the strong momentum we are used to on trend days… if you step back and look at it on SPY and QQQ really until just before power hour we held a bull trend day… 

Now the issue is that ever retest of support on the 15min 5ema really looked like the next leg down… however, that became the buy the dip opportunity and led to further upside… if you trade based strictly on the fact the 15min 5ema was going to hold support and not fail no matter what then you likely did well today… but for me I never saw an A+ setup and the few plays that were B setups that I watched barely netted 5% profits on 1dte due to the fact that we held a pretty tight range most of the day. 

I am looking forward to FOMC tomorrow hopefully giving the markets a reason to pick a direction and push that way. ",07-25-2023
"SP500 Futures Trading Plan for 7/20/23 *This is the last plan of the week, and I will be back with a plan starting on Tuesday or Wednesday.*

***Recap***: In the plan for today, I wrote that the rally has seen the market cut straight through resistance levels and that yesterday’s session *“stopped just short of one of the resistance levels I shared in the weekly prep video at* ***4595***\*, as well as the pink resistance which moves to\* ***4605*** *tomorrow.”* The latter held as resistance while the former acted as support for much of the session. With family coming into town and things to do today, I did not end up trading.

***Balance/Trend***: Dips have been bought and the market has been one time framing up for seven days, and this did not end today. Though the market traded right around yesterday’s highs for quite awhile, sellers were not able to take the market meaningfully into that range and so the trend remains up on all the time frames that I analyze.

***Analysis***: The market continues to rally after the breakout from the ascending triangle and has now crossed 4600 for the first time this year. Today’s action continues to support the theme of dip buying imbalance with essentially no sellers to be found after attempts at breaking into yesterday’s range. The steep trend up that began on Monday of last week continues unabated and this doesn’t change unless the market loses about **4600**\-**04** tomorrow.

The pink trend channel that outlines the move up since early June provided resistance today at **4605**, but after attempting lower, the dip was bought and the market rallied back over 4600 to close the day right around this level. The RSI has hardly dipped during this remarkable move and remains overbought.

***Plan***:

* The extreme buying regime figures to end somewhat soon and put in a pullback, though that doesn’t necessarily mean for tomorrow. Support for this channel sits around **4597-4600**
* The next spot I am watching for potential support will be at **4583**, a spot I am watching in the weekly profile
* If there is a deeper pullback, I am watching **4560-62** as one potential spot for support at the yellow trendline Losing this level means moving back into last week’s range
* I have discussed this earlier in the week, but I still consider **4529** a two-way pivot level (longs above / shorts below)
* Other potential supports are **4498-4504**, **4478**, **4465**
* Pink channel resistance moves to **4610-12** for tomorrow
* There is a LVN I would tentatively watch for resistance at **4618**, though these types of levels have not mattered much during this rally (same goes for **4640**)
* If Tesla earnings bring more buying into the market and the market remains in the steep blue channel, then that resistance level moves up to **4656**
* Finally, there is the aqua blue trend channel that goes back to March of this year that could provide resistance at **4665**

"SP500 Futures Trading Plan for 7/19/23 *I share my plan for educational purposes and not as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: In the plan for today I wrote that *“I would still like to see buyers hold* ***4529*** *in order to get the market to my target of* ***4574*** *and potentially higher to* ***4592.”*** After two days of balancing above this level, the market broke away today to both targets. I said in a premarket note that I was adding a trend line to define the breakout from resistance and that support for this was at **4542**. However, the market spent little time moving lower before buyers stepped in just above and sent the market higher.

I said I wouldn’t be too overeager since the market was showing balance, and I wasn’t, but once the setup came it was time to pull the trigger. Today’s trade was all about understanding the dynamics of price acceptance and rejection, and contextualizing auction theory vis-a-vis the plan and my core setups. I got long around 4564 and removed risk in the low **4570**s (minor rule break in not holding firm for **4574**). I left a runner open and closed the trade out at **4592**. The best days are when the market sees big price expansion like this and having a runner with no risk at all and profits already secured is the best way that I’ve found to take maximum advantage.

***Balance/Trend***: After two days of finding balance, the market continued higher and maintained the one time framing higher for six consecutive days now. As I said yesterday, *“...one time framing higher and that doesn’t end under today’s lows are taken out, and so we have an indication that this may be coming to an end but as of right now, it has not.”*

***Analysis***: The monster rally continues as we have now seen a 300+ point move since early June when the market broke out from long-term consolidation. I’ve adjusted the new trend line in blue slightly to include a longer time period (back to last week). This channel would put support for tomorrow at **4577**.

The market has now rallied forcefully through several levels I was watching that come from April of last year, and today stopped just short of one of the resistance levels I shared Saturday at **4595**, as well as the pink resistance which moves to **4605** tomorrow. With Tesla earnings tomorrow and earnings season underway, we may have catalysts to drive further volatility (opportunity) in the market.

***Plan***:

* If buyers continue to buy dips at the current pace, then **4577** will be an important level to defend
* If there is a deeper pullback, I would watch **4551** as one potential spot for support. This level comes from the yellow trendline in the charts  

   * Note that the buying tail on the profile from today was at **4560**, also the level I have watched this week and the one I used in today’s trade, so watching these two levels together makes sense to me on a dip
* I still am watching **4529** as potential support, but really this is a pivot level to me which I would trade short on a loss
* Other potential supports are **4498-4504**, **4478**, **4465**
* The pink channel resistance line is at **4605**, and next up I would watch the low volume node from the profile at **4618**
* The blue channel resistance level is now at **4635-39**, and I would prefer to see both levels tested to get short (though not totally necessary)
* Other potential resistance levels are **4657**, **4663**

"TSLA/ NFLX Earnings are officially on deck… 7-18-23 SPY/ ES FUTURES, QQQ and VIX Daily Market AnalysisWell if you missed it today QQQ looked (and tech as a whole) extremely weak at open this morning… we actually saw some of the biggest divergence I have seen on spy and qqq intraday in a long time… however, MSFT had their conference and boy did the market like that! MSFT officially saved the market today…

Tesla has a 6.4% move priced in for tomorrow… personally I think this is low… I am rather bullish on TSLA for earnings and long term… I am in $20k of shares of tesla for earnings… looking for $360. 

**NFLX**

Netflix earnings is tomorrow after hours… as of right now we have about a 7.4% out move expected… Netflix has a pretty strong move today. 

**SPY DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7uv6jiddscb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e75af43c26c93a8fe9edd83d5718e082a434a67f

I am going to be organizing my daily Tas a little different now… instead of a separate price action and S/D section I am going to include it all here together… try to streamline and show the fuller picture better.

Here on SPY you can see that we are in this absolutely extreme yellow bull channel… we have been in this channel since July 6th. We also remain in the red bull channel that we have been in since March 8th. 

The red channel resistance sits at 456.52 tomorrow which is just under the 456.82 supply we have… This likely if we continue this push up will be a major resistance to watch. However, if we break this resistance then we have the yellow channel which gives upside as high as 458.4 area. 

From a supply and demand stand point we have still not put a new supply in… we did however take out that 452.96 demand today with this push up… that was my major target for this week and we hit it… 

The most interesting thing is that SPY daily dmi has started a wave down yet we are pushing higher… I likely suspect that after this pretty extreme run up and also the distance we are form the daily 8ema that we are going to see todays top turn into a new supply at 454.2 and that likely sets us up to backtest 450 support. 

I had originally been looking for 447 on a sell off but with the overall strength we had here and now that the daily 8ema is above that level I will look for 450 to be support. 

The yellow channels support sits at 452 for tomorrow. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 443.14 -> 447.02 -> 456.82 -> 461.48  
 Demand- 438.17 -> 466.05

**FUTURES DAILY** 

&#x200B;

Here on futures daily we can see much of the same movement here… we are still in this pretty extreme yellow bull channel since July 10th. Now today we did come just under that red bull channel resistance. 

This is setting up pretty nicely to form a double top off 4584 which would put in a new supply and effectively take out 4577 supply. I previously mentioned 4492 supply was a possible area to watch for on a retrace but I do not expect that to happen now… the daily 8ema support sits right around 4523 and that is where I would expect us to bounce if we drop tomorrow. 

The yellow bull channel support sits at 4570 for tomorrow. 

Overall with a daily DMI wave down I do expect to see a retrace tomorrow… but as usually that likely becomes a dip buying opportunity. 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4492 -> 4577 -> 4621  
 Demand- 4437 -> 4653

**QQQ DAILY** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vrwe1yjedscb1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ce93f8614d11a3969bb2085d3d7cc16d452965e

Of spy and QQQ… qqq definitely was the most benefitted of the MSFT news… QQQ looked and was extremely weak this morning and could not find its feet at all… that MSFT news saved tech from a pretty bloody day in my opinion. 

Now here we are in the same extreme bull channel on QQQ (white here)… that resistance sits at 392.7 for tomorrow. 

We do have a green bull channel to watch here on QQQ also which we did fall just short of today. That resistance sits at 389.21. we also have our next supply levels (And resistance) at 388.47 to 389.92. I do fully still expect a retrace tomorrow but if we continue to push to the upside then 388.47/ 389.92 supplies are our target. 

If we put in a new supply off today at 385.74 then likely we could come down and take out 380… we actually did end up testing that and was holding that 380 area this morning during all the weakness. 

The white bull channel support sits at 384 for tomorrow. 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 370.39 -> 371.41 -> 380.1 -> 388.47 -> 389.92  
 Demand- 365.98 -> 400.01

**VIX**

The VIX once again found itself magnetted to this 13.5 area all day. We once again were up until the very last second set up to put in a new daily demand on the VIX… now the most interesting thing to me today is the fact that when SPY/ QQQ were pushing hard up during the MSFT news we also saw the VIX push up too… now the fact that we have now spent 4 days with the VIX trading in this same 13.3 to 13.79 area is quite interesting. 

The VIX did also break through is bear channel resistance today. This could be the start of our temporary top and pullback for the market.

Today was a bit of an up and down day… started the morning off great. And then had some struggles. I once again can not seem to read spy as two of my three losses today were on SPY. I do continue to have nice success with QQQ though. I ended up sticking with 1dte today and had a much higher success rate in doing so. 

I still severely struggled with getting anything over 5% for my wins… was able to notch out a small green day. My plan here remains trading QQQ 1dte tomorrow (I likely wont touch spy) and if that continues to go well and I do not see many immediate red entries I likely will experiment with 0dte QQQ on Thursday and Friday. 

Overall while SPY plays just have not worked out for me (the overall price action seems far more erratic and range bound than QQQ) the overall use of SPY and QQQ to have the same trend for an entry on QQQ remains a powerful strategy. ",07-18-2023

I am more inclined to use only ""Today"" price action from now on, since my strategy revolves around seeing a big green HA box with no low wick so if I were to use the 20 days period for example I woulda gotten a false entry.

"Morning Briefing 🌞 June 21st 2023Mornin' - [Last Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/14awl0c/morning_briefing_june_16th_2023/). The stock market fell on yesterday after closing out last week on a positive note. Investors have not had much to go on since the Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates steady last week. However, they will get more material on Wednesday when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the United States this week and met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in New York on Tuesday. He will head to Washington later in the week, where he will be honored with a state dinner at the White House on Thursday. He will be joined by industry leaders such as Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam. There are also plans for Modi to meet with tech leaders on Friday. President Joe Biden called his Chinese friend, Xi Jinping, a dictator, triggering an angry response from China. Biden made the remark at a campaign fundraiser in California, where he was seeking to rally support for his 2024 reelection bid. However, he made the comment at a diplomatically sensitive time as the U.S. and China look to ease economic and geopolitical tensions between the countries. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Biden's remark ""ridiculously absurd and irresponsible."" Ford CEO Jim Farley said his team was quick to jump at the chance to join EV-making rival Tesla's extensive charging network. ""I have no problem being opportunistic when it comes to advantaging my customers,"". However, the Ford chief also had a little fun at the expense of Tesla's planned Cybertruck, which he called a product for ""Silicon Valley people."" ""It's like a cool high-end product parked in front of a hotel,"" Farley said. ""But I don't make trucks like that. I make trucks for real people who do real work, and that's a different kind of truck."" 

In other news, House Republicans are looking to tackle ESG issues, policies that target ""environmental, social, and governance."" ESG defenders say the strategy allows people to make money while investing in the social good. However, Republicans and conservative Democrats say investment funds should only focus on maximizing returns for people. ""Environmental, social, and governance investing has become a cancer and a fraud within our capital markets, steering retail investors, sometimes unwittingly, into lower-performing, less diversified, and higher-fee funds,"" Barr said.

If you guys want more like this on the daily, I wouldn't mind. Just upvote and follow me, so I can gauge interest.

**Watchlist**

TSLA - Bullish full time frame continuity here, strong close on the daily. A move above 274.75 triggers both the 4hr and daily triggers, based on its ATR of $9.30~ I'd aim for 275.75, 280, then 283.65

DDOG - Double inside on the daily as well as the weekly. A break above 97.68 triggers a long on the daily, keep in mind we have to break 100.30 for the weekly to trigger up as well. For a downside move, a break below 95.30 triggers short on the daily and 94.75 for the weekly. It's ATR is roughly $4 so with enough volatility we can potentially trigger the daily and weekly.

SOFI - Shares moved above resistance around $8.50 which is where shares topped out in February and August of last year. Now that overbought conditions have subsided I believe we see a continuation of the recent move higher.

PDD - Just fell below support around $74 which is where shares topped out in September and January of 2022. The stock had a death cross in early may which implies bearish momentum and should push shares lower.

PYPL - Paypal is coming up to test resistance around $68.50, this resistance level coincides with the stock's 50 daily MA which should help push shares lower for the underperforming stock.

**Notes:**
 
- Jerome Powell speaks at 10am so be mindful of your positions.

- FOMC member Goolsbee speaks at 12:25pm.",06-21-2023

**Commentary:**

Markets experienced a downside gap yesterday, continuing their descent after the opening bell, exhibiting notable weakness. However, they managed to stabilize around mid-morning and attracted buyers around lunchtime. By day's end, the market closed near the opening level, although it remained in negative territory. With the exception of consumer discretionary, all major sectors were down on the day. The current pullback has been relatively orderly, devoid of any signs of panic.

Looking ahead, index futures are relatively quiet as we anticipate Jay Powell's testimony before the House Financial Services Committee today. While there shouldn't be any major surprises, the committee members may pose challenging questions and attempt to trip him up for political gains. As a result, we can expect some unusual volatility today and during tomorrow's testimony before the Senate.

Although markets appear slightly subdued this morning, there are several individual names displaying considerable strength, particularly in the crypto and blockchain space. Positive news flow has attracted attention to these areas. Additionally, consumer discretionary continues to buck the trend, attracting some buying interest. Even amidst the pullback, there are opportunities to be found on the long side. However, very nimble traders may discover that the most favorable opportunities in the very short term lie on the short side.

"Genuinely confused about trading fees of traditional exchangesHello daytraders,

I've been trading on crypto exchanges where the fees and profit/loss are very predictable.

Trying to get into trading stocks - TSLA, NVIDIA etc and settled on IG.com

I have been testing on demo and live and couldn't quite get a hold of how to to predict profit/loss and would like to ask experts here.

There are 3 images here:

Image 1:Bought NVIDIA stocks- Bought at $391.82- SL at $383.39

Image 2:Shows the point where I took my trade and the SL- Notice the gap between when trade was taken and the SL - my risk level for this is say 5%

Image 3:Shows the current price of NVIDIA- Price went up several multiples of ""gaps"" (distance from my entry point to SL) - in this scenario, price went up 4x the distance.

Questions:

1. If I risked 5% of my account (in this case, 5% = SGD 125 from total account size of SGD 2,500), and price went up 4 times in ""gaps"" (shown by the blue arrows), shouldn't I be expecting a profit of SGD 125x4 = SGD 500?
2. On crypto exchanges, the profit/loss are very much predictable - so in this scenario, I would be expecting (SGD 125x4 = SGD 500). Am I missing some fees calculation for traditional exchanges?

Thank you in advance for the answers!",06-15-2023
"Just Started Trading - Strategy and Results Week 1Started trading earlier this year in January. My strategy is to take it slow, steady, and safe. I identified about 20 large companies that are relatively safe and try to time the buy when there is a small enough dip to capture a small gain. Starting with $5,000 my goal is to get an average 1% gain on the account balance per week. Buys are based upon actively watching the stock and picking the entry point and buying as a limit order. Sells are typically limit orders set at 1.1% over buy price. Might be set slightly higher based on momentum or current news cycle. No trailing stops or anything like that, just bank the gain and move on to the next one. It can be hard ignoring the momentum and FOMO, but I am in six months and have made my goal each period. This will be an ongoing update.

Week 1 started with Disney, Amazon, Starbucks, Tesla, etc.

"Is this bull market in the room with us right now…? 6-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures, QQQ and VIX Daily Market Analysis (TSLA Update)NOTE- friendly reminder I will not be around tomorrow trading, no pre-market and I wont be around intraday… I will however, have my normal weekly TA up!

Well I got to say that was one terrible day of trading for me… Thursday and Fridays continue to be my demise…

Well with SPY closure today SPY officially is in a bull market again… now this is where definitions of returning to a bull market varies… some assume it is just when a total 20% recovery from the low of the bear market happens. If that is your definition then back in February bulls did that… however, if your definition is from the lowest closing price of the bear market a 20% recovery of that… then today is your day… honestly, from here no matter how you look at it… there is no denying that we officially are back in a bull market… 

This is where the market is one big psychological mind game… so 3 weeks ago I said what? I said we likely touch $430… we have failed to touch it but have come within about 40 cents of it 3x now… Now there is a lot of things saying that we are nearing the top and that we need a pullback…

However, what is the one thing that cant be predicted? Well that would be FOMO… Today actually was an incredible example of this.. IF you follow me aggressively track and watch VOLD… VOLD is the up/down volume of the NYSE… Eli5 is that basically it shows if there is more buyers or more sellers are one time… now I would say 95-99% of the time its spot on and market rarely doesn’t go where VOLD goes where up or down. 

However, today until about 1215 VOLD was in a serious decline all day… however, price went up on SPY the whole time. Why? Well in my opinion its because what can happen at times is that there is fewer large buys but more frequent smaller sells… so the net would be that there is more buying actually happening but its disguised as sells… 

The thing that I thing will be unpredictable is the FOMO now that we officially have entered a bull market… I mean if you think about it if you haven’t bought in yet because you were afraid the bear market rally was going to come to an end… hearing that this is finally an official bull market would be a pretty good reason to buy…. 

Average bull markets have historically lasted a lot longer than bear market (below stats are of every bear/ bull market)…

Average bull: 1,011 days…. Median bull: 522 days

Average bear: 286 days…. Median bear: 240 days

Take a look at the last 4 bear/ bull markets…

The last 4 bear markets averaged 196 days and a total decline of 34.7%... the bull markets that followed those bear markets were an average of 1232 days and 139.8%...  

That would mean that we nearly perfectly hit the average length of a bear market (average decline is 35.1% though)… Which means if we are 233 days and 20% into the current bull market… we COULD have 94-119.8% and about 289 days to go in this “rally” before we would see a correction…

Now yes trust me I am very clear on inflation, rate hikes, pause/ rate cuts, etc. etc. but if you are a long term investor why would you not want to buy at the official start of the bull market? 

Tomorrow could be a very interesting day…

I am impressed to say the least but the bulls strength… but after putting a supply in at 428.06 yesterday, the bulls have officially came in and put in a new demand at 426.57… In doing so we have now closed over that 428.06 supply and that least 428.68 as our target for tomorrow… IF we gap up over it or punch through it tomorrow I have no resistance until 437.87 on the daily and I have nothing on the weekly until 453.23… I should also mentioned the daily DMI has officially completely its wave down… 

From a weekly supply and demand stand point… bears need a closure under 427.35 and bulls need a closure anywhere over 428.4.

Almost every time SPY has put a new demand (support) in the next day has been a very green day… lets take a look at the date of a new demand and what % SPY moved up the next day. 

4/26= 1.99%  
 5/4= 1.85%  
 5/12= 0.35%  
 5/16= 1.21%  
 5/25= 1.3%  
 

On average SPY have closed +1.34% the day after it puts in a new demand (support).

Last night this looked like a nice inverse head and shoulders which could lead to downside… however, I got bear trapped and that definitely was not the move… this actually is turning around to be now a double bottom and bullish engulfing daily candle… this actually with a breakout tomorrow could (and even with a breakdown as long as we held 426.6) a massive bull flag that would almost certainly lead us to a green day tomorrow. 

Really the last thing that’s standing in SPYs way from a closure in the 430s is this 429.6 resistance. 

The black bull channel resistance will be 435.51 tomorrow and red bull channel resistance is 431.2.

Realistically I think we could see SPY close 432-435 tomorrow. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 422.04 -> 428.06 -> 429.68  
 Demand- 426.57 -> 437.87  
 Support- 426.6 -> 424.5  
 Resistance- 429.7 -> 431.6 -> 435.6

For the last 4 days 4292 has been a strong resistance and it was even confirmed as supply (strong resistance) yesterday… however, today the bulls immediately turned around and closed a new demand (support) at 4273. In doing so we also bounced off the daily 8ema (which in extreme bull momentum means we should see upside from here).

We now have our last resistance at 4312 and from there we have nothing on the daily or weekly until 4395/ 4540….

From a weekly stand point bulls ideally want a closure over 4290 and bears need a closure under 4284.

This daily price action is incredible as we went from a double top -> double bottom -> double top with bearish engulfing -> double bottom bullish engulfing… I actually don’t know if I have ever seen that make double tops/ bottoms in a row before… 

Futures to close over 4300 right now for the first time since August 16th… 

This to me looks like a very clear daily 8ema support test and now bounce… 

FUTURES DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 4240 -> 4292 -> 4312  
 Demand- 4273 -> 4395  
 Support- 4273 -> 4232

**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gc6x5bdj5v4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0ac84a5c680cb9637049b76ef84a6ce7c5193e3

Now QQQ I have been saying for the last week or so that I thought it was the best short… it now looks like the strongest upside move here… QQQ just came down and while not a perfect double bottom did bounce off 347.93 demand area. IT also after losing its daily 8ema while in extreme bull momentum on daily and weekly retook its 8ema… QQQ to me looks like it is minimally going to touch 357 if not 361.7 tomorrow.. 

Now the one thing here that is possibly keeping QQQ at check is that it did not put in a new demand today… however, tomorrow almost certainly will be a new demand in with a green day… 

Lets take a look at the last couple times QQQ put a new demand in and how much it bounced…

4/26= 2.72%  
 5/4= 2.13%  
 5/12= 0.54%  
 5/16= 1.21%  
 5/19= 0.34%  
 5/24= 2.43%  
 5/31= 1.16%

That means on average QQQ pumps 1.5% the day after putting a new demand in… 

Now yes I know we did not put one in… but we will put one in tomorrow at this rate… the daily DMI also has fully cycled to oversold and is ready for a bullish signal up…

Looking at the past of QQQ today the last 2 days remind me a lot of 4/25 and 4/26, also from a non candle structure but indicator stand point of 5/24.   
   
 

QQQ DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 354.95 -> 357.09 -> 369.32  
 Demand- 347.93 -> 361.7  
   
 

**TSLA UPDATE**

Well you guys know I swung some TSLA 220P over night… they opened green… quickly went red and quickly came back green… I attempted my best to get a fill at 20% green and it wouldn’t fill for me… it very quickly went red against me and well from there it never saw green again… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h4azi9yj5v4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fa3584b75816ac2cbf951682a0a4bf32ad56e68

Well today TSLA officially closed its 10th green day in a row… and as of right now after hours TSLA is up 3.36% and will most likely close its 11th green day in a row tomorrow… 

If you missed the news… TSLA and GM now teaming up also…

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y58belbk5v4b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f1404bd181dfd2f83c0b12a3403f98014b19aa

We were all wondering why the VIX was dropping so low to pre-covid levels… well today we see just why… we are not in bull market territory and the VIX has now found itself back to bull market levels… 

For the last basically 5 days the VIX has tried to bounce and has tried to put in a new demand (Support)… however, it continues to find itself selling off constantly… 

We just much like May 31st tested and rejected the white bear channel resistance that we have been in since May 24th…. The VIX now remains in extreme bear momentum on a weekly and daily time frame… 

This means that not only are SPY and VIX moving together but we are in opposing extreme momentums which could make this market do some pretty wild things…. 

The yellow support line is from 4/19 and 5/1… that support sits at 13.28 tomorrow and the next support is the red one from 12/2 and 2/2 which that support sits at 13.11 tomorrow… 

Fun facts here about the last few Fridays…

June 2nd= VIX -6.59%, SPY 1.45%, QQQ 0.75%  
 May 26th= VIX -6.22%, SPY 1.3%, QQQ 2.56%  
 May 19th= VIX 4.8%, SPY -0.15%, QQQ -0.23%  
 May 12th= VIX 0.71%, SPY -0.13%, QQQ -0.36%  
 May 5th= VIX -14.44%, SPY 1.85%, QQQ 2.13%  
 April 28th= VIX -7.34%, SPY 0.85%, QQQ 0.69%  
 April 21st= VIX -2.33%, SPY 0.08%, QQQ 0.1%  
 April 14th= VIX -4.15%, SPY -0.24%, QQQ -0.19%   
 April 6th (Thursday… no Friday= VIX -3.67%, SPY 0.39%, QQQ 0.67%   
 March 31st= VIX -1.68%, SPY 1.41%, QQQ 1.66%   
 March 24th= VIX -3.93%, SPY 0.66%, QQQ 0.37%

Of the last 11 Fridays… 

The VIX has closed red 9 out of 11 times for an average move of -4.08%.  
 SPY has closed green 8 out of 11 times for an average move of 0.68%+.  
 QQQ has closed green 8 out of 11 times for an average move of 0.74%+.

Now if we include this with the fact that SPY made a new demand and that usually means a +1.34% day and QQQ should turn today into a demand which usually means +1.5% day… the odds of a green day tomorrow are high especially after 4 days of consolidation on SPY and officially entering a bear market.

I got smoked today… had two nice wins in the morning there and from there it was just terrible… as I had mentioned VOLD was pretty much inversing the trend all day long which is extremely abnormal and not usually how markets behave… with that I honestly should have just not even traded… I even tried to play the upside in the morning bull run and perfectly managed to find the one red pullback candle… I was watching for that bigger retrace we had all day and well I was so opposed to taking it due to struggling I wasn’t even able to capitalize on it.. I ended up playing a call for the end of day run up and closed it profitable… definitely closed it early before it saw 5-6x profits of where I closed but at that point I was just happy to close out on a win… 

Tough day of trading… 

I still have the tesla swing and will include that on my log tomorrow for those of you wondering about where that is at… 

As of right now even with todays terrible day and the full loss on the small lotto tesla put I will close out a green week of trading but definitely one of my worst trading weeks in over 2 months… 

As I said I wont be trading tomorrow and honestly after today im kinda happy to have the day off and being able to mentally reset before next week. ",06-08-2023

That prediction was that SPY would see $430… at the time we were around $418.82 at closure… well I think its time for my next bold prediction… 

&#x200B;

Today we officially hit the extreme greed! Now I would have liked to see a little extra pump on the VIX but I will take the double bottom as a sign of a bounce and new demand tomorrow…

My bold prediction is that SPY will break below $400 within the next 30-45 days. I personally am targeting $395 by July 7th…

After a perfect double top off 429.62 (Mondays HOD) we officially finally got a new supply in at 428.13… that means our target with the daily DMI waving down should be 422.04. 

IF we drop to 422.04 and take out that supply then we will look for a new higher demand to be put in before we go long again.

I don’t usually zoom in this much on my daily chart but today I found it is necessary... so that you guys could see the inverse head and shoulder I am seeing here… what I see here is we pumped from 418 up to this 429.62 resistance on Monday… came back down to support at 426.6 then retested and rejected 429.62 again… with that rejection and now a bearish engulfing daily candle I am looking for minimally a 422.92 gap fill but I could see spy retesting 418-422 by EOW. 

Now there is a chance we could bounce off the daily 8ema but more likely than not the daily 20ema would be the sell off target. 

SPY DAILY LEVELS  
 Supply- 422.04 -> 428.13 -> 429.68  
 Demand- 414.55 -> 410.2

Futures also put n a new daily supply today at 4292 with a daily DMI wave down… with this double top and bearish engulfing daily candle I will be looking for bears to take out the 4240 supply… IF we lose that then next big support comes in at 4188 demand.

Futures with an impressive pattern here… double top -> double bottom with bullish engulfing candle -> double top with bearish engulfing candle… 

With this double top and new daily supply I really do favor downside here… I am looking for a drop to minimally 4260… if we lose that support then we start to target the next big support area of 4232 to 4240. 

In the off chance the bulls some how come back with a double bottom again tomorrow then we have a major resistance to watch at 4293.

Now as I have said for the last few days I thought QQQ was the better short and boy do I wish I would have played it… QQQ officially after its new supply at 354.95 we have officially taken our supply at 352.8…

We now have a really nice 354.95 to 357.09 supply area… from here being that QQQ closed below its daily 8ema and continues to show weakness on the daily DMI I will actually be looking for at least one more day of downside tomorrow. I am looking for QQQ to retest the daily 20ema for the first time since May 5th. I do see a potential to take our 337.6 supply but that will be a big reach and would have to trickle over into Friday… 

That level would be right around 342 tomorrow… With this yellow bull channel being broken its possible that we could actually see an even more sustained sell off on QQQ and tech as a whole… IF you look at tech today besides TSLA we actually are looking extremely weak and TECH absolutely led this sell off today.

So I don’t always include TSLA here but a few people ask for it often so I follow it a lot… well this week I I was looking for a breakout to $228… why? Well because the weekly had finally closed over the 100ema and the key 208.22 resistance it held for almost 6 months…

My upside target was $228 resistance on the weekly but that also was the daily supply of 229.97… 

Today we hit that level and closed out a real nice bearish abandoned baby reversal candle… for those of you who know me its my favor pattern… This could with a daily DMI waving down and establishing a $221.27 supply today (shows imbalance) lead to a open under $221.27 tomorrow… I actually have a target of $217.5 for tomorrow for the bears… but minimally I am looking for $221.27… 

However, in the off chance that TSLA bounces here then $229.97 is still major resistance and from there we look for 242-250 next week.

Now this morning I was pretty darn excited about the VIX… why? Because when we were holding over the 14.2 level we actually were ready to put in a new daily demand (support) that would give the VIX at least a move up to the $16 level and possibly the $19.5 level which would perfectly coincide with the FG index and also bearish daily chart I am seeing for SPY, QQQ and ES. 

We did however get a nice daily double bottom at 13.94. So if we were to close somewhere close to 14.2 or higher tomorrow we likely will turn this 13.94 double bottom into a new daily demand. 

However, in the off chance we continue to range on SPY or the bulls surprise everyone tomorrow we likely will see yet again another new 52 week low… at this point if the bulls want to get SPY over 430 I am fairly convinced that we need to see the VIX either in the 12s or we need a pretty large bounce on the VIX followed by another multi week sell off like we just had.

Today was a really rollercoaster of a day… started the morning off pretty rough then was really slaying it coming into that 2pm time frame… and that honestly is where I lost it all… well I closed green but I gave up a lot of profits the last 2 hours of the day… 

SPY found itself chopping in an 34 cent range from basically 145 until 330… there were a lot of convincing bull and bear traps and I definitely as you see bought into all of them… honestly this morning I really struggled because VOLD and VIX were not really matching SPY price action… and then EOD from basically 2pm until close it was the same thing… the put got wrecked then I was in a call that looked absolutely perfect… VOLD was pumping and the VIX was making a new 52 week low… but for some reason 427 was an absolute brick wall and no matter how convincing it looked like it was going to close over it… it rejected every time… 

Still a green day and still a great week of trading but definitely frustrating giving back profits EOD… I need to go back to my rule of no matter what not trading PH.",06-07-2023
"Too late to be long but still too early to be short… Welcome to the Pain Range… 5-12-23 SPY/ ES futures, DXY, 10YR Yield and VIX Weekly Recap and Analysis (BONUS TESLA TA!)Well at this point I think people think I am a permabear… however, I really don’t have a bias in this market and if you watch me trade intraday you know that I easily play calls and puts just as much… though I will say puts pay far better in this current market then calls ever do… But like my heading says “its too late to be long but its still too early to be short.” Someone posted this in a comment and it really hit me that its exactly how I feel in this market. 

Let me explain… going into this week I was fairly confident in a hot CPI which would have bene the bearish catalyst for no rate cuts, no pause and another 25bps rate hike in a month at FOMC… however, that did not obviously happen with that “cooler” CPI print we now find ourselves just barely scraping by from a market sell off… however, as this EOW price action would suggest we don’t quite have the upside pressure bulls should have hear to take this higher. 

We truly are in an extremely painful spot in this market… theta and IV crush is hitting like no other… there is no trend and there is absolutely no continuation. We are so far in my opinion overbought that I find it highly unwise to go long (plus I truly believe this market is literally scraping by on fumes and one of these days is going to let go) however, we clearly are being held up by big tech that its very unwise to go short… so what are we left to do here? Well first off ALWAYS remember CASH IS A POSITION! But honestly this is a day traders dream as we have some pretty solid movement that is really setting up for some nice intraday plays. 

I truly looking at the technicals (Which I will cover below) believe we are about as close to the top of this trend as we are going to get… however, we haven’t gotten the signals and flashing red lights that its time to go short… for now its time to play the range and wait for us to pick a direction…

On tesla Daily here we got a lot going on.. so I was VERY much so bullish EOD yesterday and was looking for the pump… the tesla ceo news caused the pump to the 173.98 targets I was looking for. Now this is where you gotta remember “buy the rumor sell the news.” What actually happened is that this huge pump put in a huge high volatility bearish day…

This is what we have right now is a bearish engulfing daily candle (4 day long actually), a failed breakout of this downward channel, and a closure back under that 168.57 demand which is the daily 8ema… this was a massive failed breakout and with this rejection a new supply at 172.27 was put in… that means our target is now the 160.87 supply. We also have bearish daily IV and with bearish price action. We also loss the red support line which was a 3 point touch… 

My ultimate target for next week is 160.87 (-4.3%) with an extreme target of 153.8 (-8.9%). 

I took a half sized 167.5P 7dte put play for this… looking to hold till at least 160.87.

Well until the EOD pump (a classic for SPY) I was actually thinking we might finally see SPY rebalance itself by closing under that 411.15 supply. However, we actually closed back over that supply so as of right now we still would be considered imbalanced. So this still either needs to close under 411.15 OR attempt to turn 411.15 into demand (support). As of right now we are in the process of discovering our next demand (support). However, I do not have a true target for that yet. 

It is extremely difficult (on spy at least) to find where this wants to end up… Our biggest support targets are 404.3 to 405.06 and resistance is 415.56 to 417.03.

The weekly supply/ demand chart actually is the one thing right now that makes me VERY bearish… one of the indicators I use (I do apologize I can not share it nor can I discuss the interworkings of it) has officially finally signaled a BEARISH weekly reversal… what does this mean? It means that we finally have reached a place where the technicals are supporting further downside. 

Spy weekly did close below that 411.87 demand (support) that does open up a chance for a drop to at least the weekly 20ema which is 404.03… a bigger retrace would be to the 385.9 or 385.21 demand. However, outside of a black swan I would be shocked to see us go that low… most likely scenario is a retrace to the 390-400 area where we could actually establish a new higher demand (support) in order to propel us back to the 412-416 area.

This daily trend is straight barcode… no other trend to be had here… WE actually for the last 6 trading days have CLOSED within the same $2.99 range… that is a very tight range. 

The most bearish thing I can take away from this is that we now have a 3 point touch blue resistance line and did lose the support of the blue 3 point support… this opens up the potential to touch the support line for the bigger black rising wedge. That support sits at 408.2 for Monday. However the biggest bullish thing I can see here is that we have now for 3 trading days in a row bounced off the daily 20ema and closed over the daily 8ema. 

With this bearish engulfing daily candle and rejection off resistance/ losing support I would personally favor downside with a target of 408.9.

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

A completely uneventful weekly chart here… we are still closing within the same $4.35 trading range for the 5th week in a row and we are still in that bigger $9.7 range for the 7th week in a row…

Now this rising wedge is about to come to a finally support test… 410.61 is that key weekly rising wedge support. If that line breaks then that would in my opinion indicate a bigger sell off is about to start. WE also have a nice carrot top (v-top) forming here too. We actually have an extremely tight breakout/ down triangle here on SPY weekly with support at 410.61 and resistance at 411.78. 

One very real scenario here is that we are going to see a fake breakout/ down and continue to range here.. I still personally would not be going long or short until minimally this $4.35 range is broken. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416  
 Demand- 411.9 -> 385.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.1 -> 404.4  
 Resistance- 416 -> 422

Now this daily futures chart actually shows a much different story… we actually today with this sell off managed to reconfirm 4153 as a KEY supply/ resistance. This supply is so important and strong that I actually am going to highlight it with a different style line… we did managed to close under the 4135 demand (support) too. With this 5 closures between 4133 and 4154 finally being broken there actually is a bigger chance of a sell off here… 

Our downside target would be 4074 on any major sell off. However, our upside target would be 4154 then 4190/4198 IF we managed to have a hefty bounce Monday.

The futures weekly chart also shows bearish reversal conditions now too… I would have liked to see a closure under the weekly 8ema but we did retest 4173 supply (resistance) on the weekly and to the point rejected it. Our target still once again remains 4054 on a weekly time frame.

The futures daily chart does make me feel and want to be far more bearish then SPY… We did manage to close below the daily 20 and 8em and closing under that 4134 support area. One other thing is that we perfectly rejected that blue resistance line making it a 4 point (extremely strong) line to watch. We also lost that 3 point support line. The final support now is the black rising wedge support at 4105 on Monday and the blue resistance would be 4160 on Monday.

Futures weekly in my opinion is showing a far different and far more bearish chart then SPY… what I am seeing here is that we are now closing below that month long range support of 4138. We did attempt to close under the weekly 8ema however, that eod push up of course stopped us from doing that… 

Our breakout triangle support is 4125 and resistance is 4140.

One thing I have highlighted here is that the 7 week post JPM collar (quarterly) roll is next week… now what USUALLY happens on week 7? Well usually what ever trend (Currently bullish) we are in will see a sizeable retrace from weeks 7 to week 11… 

Now when we keep in mind that there are perfect spy/ futures weekly bearish reversal conditions and that our breakout/ down triangles are coming to a point we very well might finally be seeing the top of this market… IF you believe in historical trends this is our opportunity to short. One thing to keep in mind is that occasionally week 7 will be the peak and the retrace doesn’t happen till week 8… I have a bigger target of 4000 for futures if this trend was to hold true… So far this trend has been a solid one to watch since 2022. 

**VIX**

Tough trend here on the VIX as we actually broke through both support and resistance of the short term triangle… so we redraw that and re-evaluate next week… we are seeing that this 16.8 area is becoming a major support area… WE did once again fail to break through 17.72 though.

We should watch these two key levels for a direction… I will say from a volatility/ iv/ price action stand point I am actually seeing further downside on the VIX for now… 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

The biggest thing I have said im watching for is the DXY recovery and 10YR breakout… we have part one which is the DXY breakout and holding that breakout… the last step is for the 10yr to breakout…

We are truly about as close to the top as we arguably are going to get… the signs are not 100% aligned yet… but there are a lot of things aligning that a sizeable correction is inbound.

Last week I put in my best week of profits for 2023 and I was 100% not trying to chase those gains as I know that is how people put themselves in a really bad spot and start taking poor trades and not securing profits… well after a very painful Monday and Tuesday I was able to secure my now most profitable week of 2023 again. 

Today was a great day of trading that I couldn’t have been any happier with… I have really struggled the last few Fridays of trading but I was able to with this range finally adapt to it and truly exploit it. 

After a terrible February… I have now put in 5 green weeks in a row and have been green for 8 out of the last 9 trading weeks. 

This market continues to be an extremely difficult one to navigate but everyday that SPY throws us a curveball and these markets do something new and unpredictable is another day we are learning and becoming better traders… Remember everything we learn now in this terrible bear market is information we will use to become that much more profitable traders in the next bull market.",05-12-2023
"Trading Plan For New TradersNote 1: This is not my work. I found this on a trading app and wanted to share. Credit to ""Bull Soldier"" on Webull Community.

Note 2: What continues, assume that you trade every day of the week for 12 months and win 50% of the time with a 2:1 risk-reward ratio.

Money and risk management are the holy grail of trading. Indeed, not the only money management strategy; trade management is also a huge part of trading success.

You can use the following formula to calculate the share size while maintaining a consistent risk of $40 per Trade. The stock prices do not matter; you can buy Amazon, Apple, Tesla, or anything with proper share sizing.

I recommend risking $10.00 per Trade when new. Still, you will make good money, and then you can increase the risk. Yes, this is simple Math! There is no secret.

*You might end with a different Battling Average, which is ok; the higher, the better; when you are new, we risk $10.00; as our Battling Average increases, we increase our risk*

Plan:
Battling Average:                          50%
Reward-to-Risk Ratio:                  2:1
Maximum Trades per Day:           3
Maximum Daily Loss (2R):            $80.00
Maximum Weekly Loss (6R):        $240.00
Maximum Monthly Loss (12R):     $480.00
Starting Account Balance:           $2,000.00
Risk per Trade (2% of Balance):   $40.00

We'll first determine the expected outcomes for a single trade, considering the 50% Battling Average and the 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio to calculate the potential weekly and monthly outcomes. Then, we'll analyze the results for a week and a month.

For each Trade, there are two possible outcomes:

Win (50% chance) - Gain $80 (2R, where R is the risk per Trade)
Loss (50% chance) - Lose $40 (1R)

Expected outcome for a single trade = (Battling Average * Win Amount) - (Loss Rate * Loss Amount)

= (0.5 * $80) - (0.5 * $40) = $40 - $20 = $20

Now let's calculate the potential weekly and monthly outcomes:

Weekly outcomes:

Maximum of 3 trades per day, 5 days per week, totaling 15 trades per week. Expected gain per week = Expected outcome per trade * Number of trades per week = $20 * 15 = $300

Monthly outcomes:

There are approximately 4 weeks a month, so we have 60 trades per month.

Expected gain per month = Expected outcome per trade * Number of trades per month = $20 * 60 = $1,200

Now, let's consider the growing account balance with a 50% Battling Average and increasing the risk per Trade by 2% of the account balance each month:

Month 1:

Account Balance: $2,000
Risk per Trade: $40
Expected gain: $1,200
New Account Balance: $2,000 + $1,200 = $3,200

Month 2:

Account Balance: $3,200
Risk per Trade: 2% * $3,200 = $64
New Reward-to-Risk Ratio: 2:1, so the win amount will be $128
Expected outcome per trade = (0.5 * $128) - (0.5 * $64) = $64 - $32 = $32

Expected gain: $32 * 60 = $1,920
New Account Balance: $3,200 + $1,920 = $5,120
Continuing this process for future months, you can calculate the potential outcomes with a growing account balance.

Summary:

Initial account balance: $2,000

Month 1:
Net winning 'R' per month: 30R
Dollar amount per 'R': $40.00 (2% of $2,000)
Net monthly profit: 30R x $40.00 = $1,200.00
Account balance at the end of Month 1: $2,000 + $1,200 = $3,200

Month 2:
Dollar amount per 'R': $64.00 (2% of $3,200)
Net monthly profit: 30R x $64.00 = $1,920.00
Account balance at the end of Month 2: $3,200 + $1,920 = $5,120

Month 3:
Dollar amount per 'R': $102.40 (2% of $5,120)
Net monthly profit: 30R x $102.40 = $3,072.00
Account balance at the end of Month 3: $5,120 + $3,072 = $8,192

Following this process for the remaining months, the possible first-year gain can be calculated. Here's the account balance at the end of each subsequent month:

Month 4: $12,288
Month 5: $18,432
Month 6: $27,648
Month 7: $41,472
Month 8: $62,208
Month 9: $93,312
Month 10: $139,968
Month 11: $209,952
Month 12: $314,928.

But what about if my Battling Average is only 40%, meaning we only win 4 out of 10 trades?

Month 4: $4,669.94
Month 5: $5,739.93
Month 6: $7,031.92
Month 7: $8,590.40
Month 8: $10,465.70
Month 9: $12,716.06
Month 10: $15,408.67
Month 11: $18,622.70
Month 12: $22,451.35

The possible first-year gain, assuming a 40% Battling Average, a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio, and a monthly risk per trade adjustment, would be $22,451.35 - $2,000 (initial account balance) = $20,451.35.

Here are some observations about the plan:

1. Risk management: The trading plan has a clear focus on risk management, with a maximum daily loss of 2R and a maximum weekly loss of 6R. This helps to limit losses and prevent large drawdowns in your account balance.

2. Reward-to-risk ratio: The plan has a favorable 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio, which means that even with a 50% win rate, you can expect a net positive outcome on average. This ratio helps balance profits and losses over time.

3. Battaling Average: A 50% win rate is a realistic assumption for many trading strategies, and setting achievable expectations is essential. The plan should remain profitable if you can maintain or improve the win rate while adhering to the risk management rules.

4. Trade limitations: The plan limits the number of trades per day to 3, which can help prevent overtrading and impulsive decision-making. This restriction can help maintain focus on quality trade setups and encourage discipline.

5. Scaling risk: The plan allows for increasing the risk per Trade as the account balance grows, which can help to accelerate gains over time. However, it's important to carefully manage risk and adapt the plan as market conditions change.

While the trading plan strongly focuses on risk management and a favorable reward-to-risk ratio, it's important to remember that trading involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary based on market conditions, individual trades, and the specific trading strategy employed.

To clarify, when we compound the monthly gains by adding them to the account balance at the end of each month, we assume that there are no external factors that could impact the trading performance or the account balance, such as market volatility, trading fees, slippage, or other unexpected events. These factors could impact the account balance, and the results could differ from the theoretical calculation.

Note 3: I mentioned but I didn't include it The position sizing formula is as follows:

Position Size = (Account Size * Risk per Trade) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)",05-07-2023

We continue to try and work through the rebalancing on SPY daily supply/ demand right now… We had a previous Supply at 411.04 that we did indeed come down and take out today… next target is 409.73 supply followed by 409.18 demand. If we break through those levels and close we would then start to target 406.61 demand and 405.17 supply. 

My ultimate target and where I hope to sell my 92dte puts is 399.07.

We are seeing price action signal a downside move now and we are attempting to break extreme momentum on SPY daily. 

Something I will touch more on tomorrow night is that we are also attempting (if we hold here at close tomorrow) to turn this 412.63 weekly double top into a new supply… That would mean we have taken out 409.98 weekly supply and can begin targeting 385.9 demand down below… granted I don’t think we will get that low its where our target would be until a new weekly demand comes in.

We for the first time in almost a month of trading have officially closed a daily candle below the 8ema… this is the first step in a bearish reversal… however, until momentum is fully broken and starts to push down we could still see the 20ema bounce us which should be right around that 409 price area tomorrow. 

We also have a new breakout triangle forming here at 412.2 resistance and 408 support tomorrow. 

The bears ideally want to see this close under 408 tomorrow and under the daily 20ema… IF we get that closure then I would start targeting 405.2… However if we close back over the daily 8ema tomorrow at 412 then realistically upside target would be the 414-415 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 409.7 -> 405.2

I have said a few times now I prefer watching supply and demand on the daily for futures as the price action is far more smooth then SPY… this continues to be the case and I continue to see 4178 supply as a key resistance. With a closure under the daily 8ema we should once again start to target 4116 demand. IF we break through that level we have a pretty steep descent to 4040/4055. 

Weekly wise we are attempting to establish a new 4173 supply which takes out current weekly 4149 supply and makes our downside target at 4055 supply.

We once again broke pretty much the last support I see from this bull run up today. With this support being broken we will now look for the daily 8ema to turn into resistance and we will watch this new black resistance line.

I saw someone compare the VIX in 2008 to current VIX and thought I would look for myself… now past does not predict the future BUT if we analyze these two charts there is a case to be made that the previous peak on the VIX we hard in March is the peak of July 2008… and that the September VIX bottom is our current bottom… IF that is the case then the major leg down is about to start…

VIX broke through resistance today and closed a nice doji… however, failed to close over the daily 8ema once again. We will watch that key 17.1 level and 17.74 level tomorrow… a closure over the 8ema to end the week could bring a bearish move next week…

I had a pretty decent day trading today.. as you can see mid day today I got really chopped up… I had saw the reversal conditions forming on the 5 and 15min chart around 1pm and I was attempting to get in on it. Of course I got stop loss hunted 2 times in a row and took some small profits on the way down… I missed out on that whole leg down as I kept waiting for a good reentry that didn’t feel like chasing. 

I was very salty getting stopped out and then it immediately rejected back to a profitable spot. But that’s the name of the game. We cant always and wont always get every move and our timing as much as we try to be perfect will never be perfect every single time…. But in the end we put in a really nice profitable day again today… 

As of right now (if I didn’t trade tomorrow) This is my most profitable trading week since the first week of March. I am looking forward to ending tomorrow on another good note as this has been a great week of trading.",04-20-2023
"ES/MES Trading Plan for 4/20/23 *I share my plan for educational purposes and not as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: In the plan for today, I wrote that *“...there is potential support at* ***4160-66****, while a failure here could take the market well lower, making this a two-way pivot. As always, I would prefer to find some confirmation if I am trading around this, like clearing* ***4157*** *to the downside and* ***4174*** *support (or higher) to the upside…”*  Instead of following my own rules and waiting for confirmation, I pre-empted the trade to the downside (about 20 minutes after market open) and exited shortly after when it turned against me. Though this loss was minor and below my max daily limit, it’s especially painful to lose due to a controllable error. I recognized my bias pretty quickly though and exited, and decided I’d just call it a day. Later in the session, the market retested **4166** and later cleared **4174**, running up towards my target of **4190** but stopping short and reversing. 

***Balance/Trend***: The market remains inside of the consolidation flag structure in yellow in the charts. For the most part of this week, the market has traded inside of Friday’s range and this signals that there’s been little change relative to last week. Economic news releases tomorrow should change this. Today’s close was right around the steep lower trendline of the channel in white. Tomorrow’s release will give us clarification on whether or not this trend remains intact.

***Analysis***: There’s not a lot of change in the market to analyze relative to yesterday, with the market remaining inside of the flag structure and continuing to coil tightly for an impending move. I have been tracking this big resistance zone in the **4180-93** range (and up to **4203** really), and today’s rejection at the highs came on a test of the top of this flag structure. This rejection left a moderately sized selling tail on the TPO profile. It’s no surprise to see that sellers left excess at roughly the same location as yesterday, indicating that they’re continuing to defend the highs against buyers who are not showing a lot of strength in pushing the market higher these last couple of weeks. 

***Plan***:

* With jobless claims, economic indicators, and several Fed speakers on tap for tomorrow, in addition to Tesla reporting earnings today along earnings season really getting underway, we can expect some movement soon
* The market remains in the flag structure below **4186** \- **4194**, and these are two important resistance levels to watch as the market continues to respect this structure quite well; targets are **4158**, **4149**, and **4139**  

   * Today’s settlement price will be just below the steep trend channel and I would watch **4186** especially closely because this would be the level where the market either re-enters the steep trend up or rejects it and sells off
* There is potential major resistance at **4203**, and this would be the last line of defense for sellers intent on keeping bulls at bay. I plan to be super attentive to this trade, because it could mean breaking down below other resistance levels mentioned above and take the market down quite a bit
* Finally, breaking out from the flag structure in the charts is a big win for bulls and they shouldn’t encounter much resistance (if they’re strong, at least) until **4221-23**, targeting a backtest to the flag at about **4192-95**ish
* Other potential resistance levels are at **4243**, **4288**, and **4313**
* If the market rejects the trend and begins to sell off, I would not be too keen to try to trade counter to that. One potential spot to try a long would be at **4120-25**, targeting **4139**
* Other potential supports lower are **4110-12**, **4097-4100**. Losing this last level would start the process of repairing poor structure in the market down to **4010** or as low as **3981**

"4-18-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Daily Market Analysis (NFLX earnings and BONUS Tesla Earnings Preview and TA)Despite an impressive nearly $3 intraday drop and a straight drop for the first hour of the day… we once again found ourselves in a downtrend that consolidated before an EOD breakout… I will say today felt different though.. but still was in the end a “bullish” day. 

Actually the fact that we are closing today green (granted barely green) but had that morning sell off doesn’t feel right. Today intraday felt far more bearish than the day actually closed.

I did NOT play a position on Netflix (I have a pretty hard set rule NOT to trade earnings…) but I would have eyed some 310 puts on Netflix… as of right now that would have paid out impressively well.. See how this holds in the morning. 

Netflix has a way in my opinion of shaping the future of earnings for tech… Next up is Tesla tomorrow…

Tesla is expecting a 6.4% move per IV for tomorrow and actually interestingly enough their EPS is predicted to be fairly low compared to the last few earnings only predicting us to be 0.85. I still do not recommend any earnings plays but I am putting out the information for others.

I don’t usually include tesla but including it today for a freebie as many have requested it return… its not staying but since earnings are tomorrow lets talk about it…

Weekly wise we have been holding this red channel of 166.94 to 208 since the week of January 23rd and we have now formed a massive breakout/ breakdown triangle… one could actually infer that this triangle is a massive bear flag too… Now if we see Tesla break below 181.3 by EOW then we are breaking that support and I would see that as a fairly tempting short play and honestly a closure under 166.94 would be further confirmation of downside… I would start to target 150.1 and 133.26.

However, IF earnings come in good and we get an upside pump then key resistance is 203.08 followed by confirmation at 208 EOW. For me I actually would be fairly tempted to play a 30-60dte call or put in the direction of Tesla post earnings… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Interesting day today… we FINALLY got a new supply put in. With a new supply put in at 414.1 (just below previous 414.13 supply) we now start to target 411.04 and 409.73 supplies. However, this is where we are once again in a weird pattern here.. we established a new supply which should generally be seen a resistance… however the way today opened and moved actually put the supply in lower than todays close which actually makes this a support area to watch… This is where things get complicated and we have to be careful… 

While a new supply means we look to retest lower supplies and target previous demand (support) which currently is 411.04 -> 409.73 and 409.18… when market is imbalanced like this we could actually bounce form here and attempt to immediately turn this 414.13 supply into a demand (support) which would be extremely bullish… Turning a supply into demand or a demand into supply is an extremely strong move. 

Spy is still in extreme bull momentum and the daily chart still is setting up for reversal conditions… however they are not quite perfect just yet…. Daily 8ema should still attempt to hold as support… if and when we lose that daily 8ema is when it will be time to look out below…

The price action here on spy daily actually perfectly held the resistance line of that red rising wedge at 415.7 however, once again we had a bigger bounce off the low with no bearish continuation and that led to this lower end wick… 

The rising wedge continues to come to a tighter point here which very well could come to an end tomorrow… generally speaking rising wedges are bearish reversal patterns and when formed with this cup and handle potentially here on the daily… we are looking at a hard top with a bigger drop possible… 

Key support is 413.9 tomorrow and resistance at 415.9.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 414.1 -> 415.4 -> 417  
 Demand- 409.2  
 Support- 414.1 -> 412.4 -> 409.6  
 Resistance- 415.6 -> 416.9 -> 419.6

Today we also saw a new supply put in on futures daily at 4178… this is a major level to watch as this is a resistance level that dates back to February. 

Now with this new supply here and being that futures is far more balanced than SPY daily (another reason I like watching both) this shows that we could easily see a retest of 4160 and possible 4154 support (previous supplies) tomorrow or later this week. Our target here should be previous demand at 4116 if we can break through those 4160/4154 levels.

Like I mentioned 4178 is a major level and you can see yesterdays rejection there was a major rejection for the 3rd time (With a candle body). Now interestingly enough we did pump over night and touched 4198 and nearly perfectly rejected it… not only that but we now have formed a rising wedge inside of the rising wedge. 

Currently blue rising wedge support sits at 4160 for tomorrow (which is a supply level) and resistance sits at 4200 and then 4218. 

The one thing that is clear as we have tested this 414+ area and 4160+ area is that we have come into some heavy resistance. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4154 -> 4160 -> 4178 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4116  
 Support- 4152 -> 4139  
 Resistance- 4200 -> 4236

I continue to remain impressed that the VIX goes lower and lower… 

The VIX, formally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, measures how much volatility professional investors think the S&P 500 index will experience over the next 30 days. Market professionals refer to this as “implied volatility”—implied because the VIX tracks the options market, where traders make bets about the future performance of different securities and market indices, such as the S&P 500.

Above is a reminder of exactly what the VIX is… now lets talk about this for a second… 

&#x200B;

Over 40% of all S&P-related options are now same day expiry (Source: Optionmetrics), or “zero-day-to-expiry” options, shorthanded as “0DTE”. Ten years ago this number was about 5-10%. The daily volume of 0DTE contracts on the S&P 500 (SPX) increased from around 400,000 in January 2022 to approximately 1.2 million in March 2023, representing a three-fold increase in daily volume, according to data from OptionMetrics.

What does this mean and why does it matter? Well this is just my opinion and gonna be a bit of a tin foil hat/ rant moment… We are starting to see days where the VIX is red (dropping) and Spy is red… and we are also seeing a lot of times now where SPY is going on a sell off only to see a huge EOD recovery… 

What is causing this and why are we getting tiny movement and no continuation? 

My opinion here is that we are seeing a few things happening… with this massive spike of 0dte options big money is playing options intraday and they are getting their instant hit and then through the rest of the day taking that OI off the boards and often times causing huge recoveries when they do so… 

Why are we not seeing continuation? Well the underlying VIX is not rising… why? Well no one is going short with long DTE… everyone is trading 0dte or similar net short positions… there is no more of these longer DTE contracts that take a week or two to play out… but according to many articles and analysts… big money is the most net short since 2011 and 2018 (depends on the article)… but how could the VIX be in the 16s which by all means is a bull market level? 

Well this is my thoughts… Markets are pretty much being set up to get slaughtered here soon. Why? Well what is happening is that markets once again do not believe jpow… they believe we are getting 100bps of rate cuts by EOY… but that’s not going to happen (as of now according to JPOW)… markets are “forward looking” but there is a lot to be said that they are too forward looking right now… plus we know historically its time to sell the last rate hike… Now if that was last meeting (if jpow changes his tune) but most likely that will be this May 3rd meeting… IF that is the last rate hike (if JPOW hard hints at this) then we are likely seeing a top on SPY and we are going to start to see some heavy downside… 

Now much like a month ago in march when we had the Bank run… we had huge spikes in the VIX… why? Well markets FINALLY thought there was a reason to not only sell… but to continue to sell as they thought we were apart of the next great financial crisis (we may still be)… however, quickly the VIX would dump… why? Well markets no longer believed that was the case which has led to this rally…

Honestly we are in for some pretty serious pain for the next 2 weeks unless earnings severely tank the markets. Now if earnings come in bad and give bad guidance (or recession hints) we might start to see the VIX push back up leading into FOMC… but I think we might be in some pain sitting in this 400-420 area for the next few weeks until FOMC and CPI… Markets need a reason to sell off and to continue to sell off and they just have not had that reason yet… 

0dte options has forever changed the game.

Today I experimented with using 1dte SPX options again… if you have been following me for a while you knowing I used to love SPX 0dte scalps and level to level plays for all of 2022… however, come November when 0dte everday hit the markets the game changed forever… we were left with some extremely choppy and awful premiums… I had moved to further dte because we were having issues of entering and basically immediately being down 5-7%... getting stopped out and then seeing a huge move… it also was not entries and we were seeing premiums moving outside that of actual price action… 

Well I did experiment with some 1dte SPX today and so far I don’t hate it… I will continue to monitor this over the next week or so and see if I want to stick with 1dte or go back to 2dte SPY… The biggest thing I did notice today though was that mid day consolidation that the 1dte premiums got ate up extremely fast and often times led to being correct on the move and direction but finding ourselves losing value as the play moved in our direction.",04-18-2023

Now mid day we had the Swiss say basically that CS was “too big to fail.” We then had a $4 pump on one candle. I do not think I have ever seen a $4 15minute candle outside of FOMC or other market breaking news. That was one impressive recovery…

Something that was very interestingly noted this morning was that the 2y/3m yields inverted for the first time since January 2001.. as you can see that led to a surprise 50bps CUT by the fed and also a massive 4.8% green day when they did that… IF we get a cut tomorrow I would 100% ride a 0dte call to glory…   
 

Now do I think we get a surprise cut? No not really… especially with data tomorrow and Friday to come still and FOMC being next week already… I am still not convinced we get a fed pause at FOMC Wednesday still…

Honestly something that is pretty interesting today is how strong some of TECH was… the top dogs all finished green outside of Tesla today… Incredibly the Nasdaq still closed a red day though… Looking at the sell pressure/ breath of SPY, NASD and NYSE it is very clear that there was a heavy rotation out of NYSE into SPY/ NASD today. 

I understand a rotation out of the banking sector right now and I suppose that money has to flow somewhere… however, I find it a little bit odd to pile into TECH in a situation like this. To me big tech is not “safe” money nor is it somewhere you should be looking to put your money IF there truly is a bank run/ financial crisis happening before our eyes… Very interesting to watch today and watching VOLD. 

The fact that SPY was able to close over its opening price today with the constant sell pressure that VOLD (NYSE) had all day is incredibly impressive. Even VOLSPD (S&P500) had constant sell pressure most of the day… There was so many rogue bounces and rogue candles today that were hard to explain. Today of the last 5 tradings days (since the bank run issues) was definitely the hardest to trade. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

There is really not much of a supply and demand update today. The biggest thing to note is that we did bounce direction off 385.87 demand once again today. That would re-confirm 385.87 as a strong support and would once again make our upside target 394.68 demand (now resistance). 

The only reason to suspect downside is if we were to establish a new supply (resistance) short of 405.17. According to the technical we are in the process of doing just that within the next few trading days. IF tomorrow closes under 385 we realistically will most likely establish a new supply (resistance) at 389.42. 

We are in a holding pattern from a S/D stand point.

We once again find ourselves in a blue falling wedge on the SPY daily. This falling wedge seems to get re-written every day for the last few days. This tells me that price action really is undecisive here. Actually if you look at the last 4 days of trading candle wise this reminds me a lot of February 22nd to February 27th. 

There realistically is not enough data to know where we are headed next… And honestly anyone who claims “I KNEW we were going to retest 383-385 today…” “Or I knew we wouldn’t hold over 390 after yesterday.” Is a big fat liar. Yes from a technical stand point we can 100% call out levels and regardless of technical or news driven we will eventually hit a level… however, we are 100% in a news driven market with the banking issues and fed funds rates right now. None of today was predictable unless you some how had insider news on CS. Just like no one could have predicted SPY would put in a $4 green candle at 215pm today… 

Anyone swinging options in this market is crazy if you ask me. One tweet is all it takes to send this market tumbling or rumbling. IT 100% is best to sit cash and play whats in front of us… 

The biggest things to watch for tomorrow is this falling wedge. Resistance will be at 387.9 tomorrow. Which means unless we open red and hold red all day we will break that resistance for the falling wedge which should open the upside. With that falling wedge being broken bulls will once again attempt to take back 390.1 pivot point. However, if the bulls either reject the falling wedge or reject 390.1 pivot point tomorrow then we are very likely going to see a sell off back into the low 380s if not 370s. 

This market is what I would call extremely fragile right now. Everyone is 100% on edge right now and no one knows whats going to happen in the next week, month or year… and there is a lot of big money that is getting nervous. With the fact that we had our 4th 150mil+ volume day in a row for the first time since may 2022 there is A LOT of trading happening behind the scenes. Tread lightly.

Much like SPY there just isn’t much going on yet. However, technical fully support that we are about to see a new supply (resistance) put in. IF we were to close red tomorrow and especially close under 3895 we most likely will establish 3955 as supply (resistance). IF you look at the last 3 trading days they all hard rejected attempts to breakout and close over that level. 

IF we see 3955 established as a new supply (resistance) that would be an incredibly strong resistance that is going to take a lot of effort to break through. That would open up the potential for downside to 3833.

Here on futures I have highlighted this black range from 3888 to 3955 which 5 of the last 5 tradings days has closed within. This is a major level that we have currently established as consolidation. 

The markets here are consolidating waiting for the next move. Futures also has a red falling wedge formed that too keeps getting the goal post moved almost every day it seems. That resistance lies at 3948. 

Currently futures is attempting to close over key 3920 pivot point. After this double top off 3955 we should have and did get downside. The question now is will this double top turn around and immediately form a double bottom? 

If bulls can retake the day tomorrow we will need to take out and most importantly close over 3955 in order to see continuation. If there is a rejection and closure under 3955 again tomorrow I would 100% expect a retrace back to 3888 area. 

Futures levels:  
 Supply- 4055  
 Demand- 3833 -> 3895 -> 4095  
 Daily Support- 3920 -> 3888 -> 3870 -> 3829

The VIX has been absolutely on the move the last 5 trading days. Seems to be that anytime the VIX crosses that 26.9 area we get a huge retracement. The VIX is clearly remaining elevated here as people are piling into those longer term protections.

The FG index officially hit 19 today. The last time the FG hit 19 was on October 12th. At that time the VIX was trading $33-$35 and SPY was trading $356 to $359 area.

The Dollar actually got a really big bounce today closing back in that 104.7 area. With this big bounce off that 103.6 area we are now trading back in the 104.6 to 105.1 consolidation range we spent most of march trading within.

Realistically not too surprising with the CS news this morning we had a massive rate drop on the 10yr today. There was a ton of money that piled into the safety of bonds/ yields today. 

The question remains what happens next? We saw a similar situation on Monday and the next day the 10yr shot right back up as people piled back into the market on Tuesday with the good CPI read. If there is no new “good” data like CPI (though I will say the PPI reading was REALLY good this morning) is there enough reason to get people out of the 10yr and back into the market?

Today ended up being a green day but honestly today was a pretty frustrating trading day. There was many times where we would have everything lined up for the perfect put opportunity and we would even have price action breaking through key levels that generally signal a good put opportunity only for price action to take a hard $2 reversal. 

I don’t know if I have ever seen so many $1 one minute candle reversals. Today was very difficult to trade as I felt like price action was moving so aggressively for one and so erratically for two that it was very difficult to “stay ahead.” This week and some of last I started using breakeven stops and setting profitable stop losses (generally 5%) which saved me numerous times from some of these incredible reversals we had. 

Todays price action compared to the last 5 days felt very artificial and unpredictable. Today despite similar high volume and trends on VOLD did not trade anywhere remotely close to the other 4 trading days that were similar.",03-15-2023
"Which do you think is better: Fundamental or Technical Analysis?So this has been an ongoing debate for decades now. We also saw both success and horror stories from both camps. But a lot of people seem to favor one over the other.

Considering both camps' pros and cons, which do you personally prefer?

"Temporary bottom or dead cat bounce?... 3-2-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market AnalysisI had some questions yesterday about my supply/ demand levels on SPY and why they may have seemed “off.” So let me explain a little. 

The gauge/ indicator identifies new levels either supply or demand. and unless it ""takes it out"" then its still there. Thats where this price action on SPY is VERY weird because like you said we should NOT establish a supply and then be over it and be under a demand like that either. however, with the current price action and these wild 1% +/- gap ups/ downs thats where the technicals are showing something that just isn’t quite playing out yet… it just is an testament to how odd this price action has been and how irrational it truly has been. (below information is from last night not todays charts/ price action). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h5vs4nx5qela1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8a2d7a1f01451eab72b446f63a3b70703d25107

The issue is that its not flipping the name of supply/ demand but the issue is because SPY is only intraday trading but really its tracking with ES we are getting these massive gap ups that is messing price action up... look at futures and you can see its not like that at all... we ARE breaking through previous 3975 demand but just established a new one at 3960 which makes sense. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m0i3dsf6qela1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c5e1e9eb195ebb20e4564ecf4ba5c573719b9f

However, looking at SPY here this is the issue... so we formed super nice resistance at that 414+ area and then we started our descent and the way the price action has happened we put in demand at 405.74. From there we had a really nice bounce which took out a demand at 409.6... this opens downside back to the demand. So the issue comes in that we had that huge 2% drop last Tuesday which then resulted in a goofy massive wick day on Thursday that established a demand.

The next issue is that we did not push up to take out the 405.7 demand we just continued to dump.

Same thing this week we had a huge absolutely weird movement on Friday cause of data which put in oddly a supply (granted not a strong one but its there and enough to note)... and now we are pushing back down...

So what REALLY needs to happen to ""balance"" this out is for SPY to establish demand down here somewhere form 388 to 396. push all the way back to 405.74 demand. and then either retrace to confirm a new demand. or establish that as a new supply and then we can start our fall back down.

So what im saying and honestly its funny (I posted all this last night in the TA comments but just recapping it) is that we are seeing this play out now… in this scenario we will push back to 400.7/ 3990 area and then we will be more balanced and looking better technical wise.

If you were wondering what the change today and the massive pump came from was Bostic… So just like that a 50bps scare flash crashes the market and then a 25bps discussion spikes the market…

Oddly enough the current estimate is still at 30% for a 50bps and has not come down. Im not sure if this CME is live or not so this probably overnight will see an adjustment. 

Where does that leave us then? Are we bullish? Bearish? Or is this a temporary bottom? Relief bounce?

Lets take a look at our current supply and demand daily levels. Today was a big day for sure. 

On SPY we have established with this push up today 394.7 as a new demand level. With that demand on SPY itself we have an upside demand of 400.7 and 405.7. Now SPY is as I mentioned yesterday in extreme bear momentum so most bounces should reject off the daily 8ema. However, if we can close a green day tomorrow we very well could break that extreme bear momentum as we had just entered it on the 27th and are not very deep into it yet. 

If we can continue momentum tomorrow my target would be 400.7 demand level which is going to corelate perfectly with a daily 20ema resistance test. 

On SPY supply wise we have that 396.5 area and besides that the next major supply level is up near 414-417. 

Supply and demand for SPY wise the most bullish case here which is support by indicator is that we will go up tomorrow potentially as high as 400.7 (but honestly we don’t need to go that high), establish a NEW supply somewhere over 396.5. Then early next week a healthy retrace to take out that 396.5 supply and potentially confirm demand at 394.6 would absolutely open upside to 405 area. This is the scenario I most closely am watching for. 

On a bearish supply and demand case for SPY If we were to fail to breakout to 400.7 which is probable since we did not have any meaningful pullback today and we establish a new supply up here this could have been a dead cat bounce. IF that happens and we reject this daily 8ema retest here especially if we double top then I would be eyeing us to come down and retest previous demand at 388.5 early next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fk8fztc8qela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ff4de9874aa734975a02bc7c3f152295470099

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we broke through that red falling wedge/ bear channel which does give us upside to the black resistance which will be around 401.9 tomorrow and also coordinates with a daily 20ema resistance retest. 

Bulls were able to retake the daily 100ema today however, they are going to face heavy resistance as we come into that 400 to 400.6 level as that is the daily 50/200ema and that is previous demand and we should have the daily 20ema lingering right above there. 

With this daily bullish engulfing candle here I remain short term bullish. I really was hoping for this to hold closing to 397 and see a bigger pullback to take out some 15 minute chart supplies down at 396 first. With the daily 8ema being here and extreme momentum we are likely to see a rejection here or at least minimally retest support down below. I was planning to long here with a 30dte call however we did not pullback and I do believe that will come tomorrow. 

There is potential if bulls can close on a bullish note tomorrow… which would be a close over 396.4 that this is a bullish and I would suspect a run up next week into CPI. 

Supply- 396.5 -> 414.13 

Demand- 394.64 -> 400.7 -> 405.7

Key SPY Support- 394.6 -> 392.7 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 397.9 -> 400 -> 400.7 -> 401.6

Taking a look here at the futures daily supply/ demand chart you can see that we nearly last night came down within 5 pts of the 3920 demand from 1/19. While we did not touch it that is still very bullish in nature to have that long of a wick. Now this is where TOS and TV differ but on TOS this is a double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle with is bullish. 

With a new demand now established at 3960 we have officially taken out previous 3975 demand. You can see though as I mentioned on Spy with us being in extreme bear momentum that the most probable place for a rejection is the daily 8ema which is where we rejected and not only that but we rejected off that 3990 supply. 

If bulls can continue momentum there is a case to be made where we could close over 4020 tomorrow, establish a new supply and then end up coming back down next week to take out 4015 and 3990 supply. This would be very bullish. If bulls lose 3960 on a retest though that would signify that we are gong to come back down to that 3920 demand eventually. 

On the daily I do see on both SPY and futures a IV drop (bullish) and I do see reversal conditions set up volatility wise. This could all set us up for this to actually be the temporary bottom. 

My thoughts are with the fed members talking about 25bps now and talking about how CPI was a fake rebound (or temporary) that this actually is setting us up for a rally back to 405 next week prior to CPI.

Taking a look here at futures you can see the same thing that we are coming in closely here on the daily 100ema and 8ema. Both of which did hold as resistance today. IF this continues tomorrow upward the 4020 level is going to be a major resistance level as that is going to be the daily 20, 50 and 200 ema along with being a previous supply level. 

From a bullish standpoint a closure over 3975 tomorrow would be extremely bullish for the weekly timeframe. 

Supply- 3990 -> 4015

Demand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3985 -> 3990 -> 4016 -> 4020

**TESLA TA will no longer be included.** I have found I am being pulled in too many places.. my own fault… I will no longer be focusing on Tesla in my daily TA. It is something I will chat about occasionally but it just isn’t something I plan to trade anymore.

Taking a look at the VIX here this was a pretty impressive drop on the VIX. We actually have broken back under 19.6 for the first time since February 16th. Which was the first day of the current down trend that we are in. This 19.6 is a pretty major pivot level here and this could also with this massively bearish engulfing candle signify a local bottom. 

I do think the evidence of a bottom is there and I do think that if we close over 3975 tomorrow that there is a high probability that we see a push to the upside next week. 

Next week is pre-CPI week which historically does move a good amount. The case of a rally into CPI now instead of a dump into CPI is growing here. We have two more fed speakers tomorrow and we will have to see what they have to say compared to what the fed speakers said today.

Overall day trading today and really this week has been pretty excellent. I am very satisfied with my trading and how the week has gone. Strictly from a day trading perspective one of my better weeks in a while. 

Today I finally cut my AMD and Nvidia swings for a loss from last week. I really should have waited on Nvidia earnings before I opened AMD/ nvidia last week but honestly based off other tech I had very little to suggest they would beat let alone rally 12% like they did. I also though that would be a blow off top and would drop us even lower after. 

Unfortunately I considered pretty much all day cutting AMD which was around -25 to -28% all day and Nvidia around -60 to -65% all day. I finally decided by EOD I would cut them and then that investor decided to announce a huge stake in AMD and I watched the price pump $1.2 before my eyes and premiums drop a top. I bailed then and im glad I did as that took a huge pump right after. 

Looking at my long puts I was able to close them all besides AMD and Nvidia for profits. I had plenty of opportunities (especially on AMD…) to close them for much less but I kept holding thinking it would finally retrace. 

Would I take the play again? Yes but I would have waited till after earnings this time. Not a big deal gonna close my week red but that’s alright. I still like the trade in the end of the day.",03-02-2023
"Morning Briefing 🌞 Mar 1st 2023 - Let's make some money![Previous Post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/11e83ib/morning_briefing_feb_28th_2023/) This morning, the S&P 500 futures experienced a decline due to concerns over rising interest rates, which led to a sell-off in the market. According to a note from JPMorgan's trading desk, this puts the S&P 500 at risk of breaking below a crucial chart level, potentially accelerating bearish price pressures. Nasdaq-100 futures also dropped 0.8%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures saw a small gain, driven by strong performance from Salesforce shares. Other notable movements included Okta shares jumping on solid earnings and guidance, and Tesla shares losing 5% after the company failed to provide details on its next-generation vehicles during its much-anticipated investor day on Wednesday. Additionally, the rise in bond yields and concerns of a potentially larger-than-expected hike from the Federal Reserve have fueled investor concern, putting a dent in the early 2023 rally. Investors are awaiting jobless claims and other economic data, while a speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller is scheduled for Thursday afternoon. A disappointing investor day for Tesla could also have broader market implications.

**Overall Market Outlook**

SPY - Bearish indecisive spinning top candle close on the daily TF. We bounced from the daily 200WMA and currently sitting above the 200MA and 200WMA on the daily. We also have a possible double bottom on the daily. And we are still squeezing on the 4Hr TF. Expected Move +/- $3.34

QQQ - Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We bounced from the daily 200MA and currently sitting above it. And we have a possible double bottom on the daily. And we are still in a squeeze on the 4Hr TF. Expected Move +/- $3.24

**Watchlist**

TSLA- Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We sold off and closed below the 8Ema on the daily. We also started to squeeze on the daily. And we filled some of the gap below but still have more to fill below 198.52 down to 197.67 area. That head&shoulders worked out in are favor! Take 205c or 210c Calls above 196.67. Take 180p or 175p Puts below 186.67. Expected Move +/- $13.30

NVDA - Three Black Crows candle pattern close on the daily TF. We filled some of the gap below and still have more to fill below 225.08 down to 211.04 area. And we closed right below big supply zone. Take 235c Calls above 230.50. Take 220p Puts below 224.15. Expected Move +/- $7.18

SKX - Skechers just moved higher off support around $43.20. I believe we see a continuation of this move higher as the stock swung above its 50 daily MA yesterday as well implying bullish momentum.

FOLD - This stick moved above resistance around $13.62 after reporting earnings yesterday which is where shares topped out on January 13th. I believe we see a continuation of this move higher.

LSCC - The semiconductor stock reported better than expected earnings last week. I believe we should see a move higher above this $85.54 resistance level which is where shares topped out back in November of 2021.",03-02-2023
"Sell the RIP… 3-1-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis and RecapWell after yet another day of high volatility, high IV and range bound movement ($3.31 total movement intraday) we are yet again still seeing sell the rip happen here in the market. Will this continue or will we see an upside push? 

One interesting thing to note now is that SPY and Futures are both officially in extreme bear momentum. Which means that we are going to need a bigger and more aggressive bounce in order to see a reversal upside. We would need to close over the daily 20ema and continue upward after that to convinced me of an upside reversal. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jknon4hih7la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9d09d3a841e8572afa95167fe672c256db374e

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see we have that nice 396.36 supply level that we established on Friday. With that being established we then broke out over it… tested demand and rejected it at 400.6 and then came back down and now we are closing back under supply. This is very bearish in nature. 

I would suspect with this movement especially with the rejection and closure back under the daily 100ema today that we should continue to see a push down until we either establish a new demand or we bounce off 388.66 demand. We interestingly enough still have a very old supply level at 383.81 that has not been taken out yet. We could see a large push or large flash crash there eventually (think CPI or FOMC) to take that out before we go back up. 

Again I remain bearish overall until SPY closes over 400.6 and now until we close and HOLD over 396.36. 

The biggest bullish case here is that we establish a new demand in this 390 to 394 area over the next 2 days and that could set us up for a bigger push back to that 400.6 demand which would get us a daily 8, 20 and 200ema retest. From there though I still would suspect downside unless we are able to hold up there. WE also today turned Fridays 395.4 support level into resistance today which again just further confirms downside. 

I would actually like to be in some 14dte puts on SPY but the issue is that premiums are getting theta ate and chopped up with this high IV and these massive moves up before it finally retraces. 

Supply- 396.36 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.6 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 394.7 -> 393.6 -> 391.5 -> 390.1

I again remain far more bearish on futures than I do on SPY itself. What we have here yet again is a daily 8 and 100ema rejection on Futes. One thing to note here too is that we had established a demand at 3975… broke over it… established a new supply the very next day… and then now we have rejected that supply level and lost/ closed under that demand. Which again as you can imagine is bearish in nature. 

The next bigger demand here to keep an eye on is 3915. Similarly with Spy until we realistically can close and hold a candle over 4020 supply I am not bullish on SPY and with futures also in extreme bear momentum we should look for upside pushes to sell the rip. We of course can play and does appear to be happening everyday the LOD bounces to retest resistance before falling lower. However, the risk to reward is low for such plays. 

Despite almost every day being a tight $3-$4 choppy annoying range… at some point we are going to get a bigger breakout move and I will not risk being on either side of that. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020

Demand- 3975 -> 3915

Key Futures Support- 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920 

Key Futures Resistance- 3968 -> 3975 -> 3990

Tesla is sitting in no mans land. I actually almost took some calls on it because of investor day tonight (its going on right now and let me tell you it’s a snooze fest)…. Speculation remains that a new model will be released here that is about 25k-30k… lets see if that happens. 

From a technical stand point we are stuck between 194.25/ 196.3 demand and 207.7/214.23 supply. Essentially there is no play until we either establish a new supply below the current 207.7 one which would indicate the ceiling is get lower and we could look for a retest of 194-196 and possibly lower, or we get a new demand above 196.3 which would confirm that $2 range as massive support and that would push us back to that 207-214 range. Until that happens there is zero play. 

Interestingly enough looking at the last tesla investors day it had an 6%+ drop the following day… 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75  
 Demand- 196.29 -> 194.25

Key Tesla Support- 202.8 -> 201 -> 197.8 -> 196.3 -> 194.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 206.3 -> 207.7 -> 210.8 -> 214.2

Interestingly enough the VIX did not break down today but it did close a red day while SPY also closed a red day which is definitely not the normal way this market works. The VIX held the 20ema support here but did reject the daily 8ema. 

One interesting thing to note is that the last time the VIX was in this area was February 17th… SPY had a LOD of 404.05 and a HOD of 407.51 that day. Currently with the VIX at the same level our LOD was 393.38 and HOD was 396.69.

What is the main point… despite “fear” not spiking we are seeing a market retracement.

I just realized I made a ton of trades today. I made 10 intraday trades (also closed 4 different longs) today vs. 6-7 trades/ day that I have been averaging. 

I had opened a slew of 30dte puts on Friday and pretty much Monday immediately regretted it. I thankfully was able to exit all but AMD and Nvidia today for profits but my bags were pretty heavy most of this week. The most frustrating thing was how these stocks would move up and down the way they did. 

Actually the most frustrating and kinda fascinating thing is that despite most of the stocks I was holding have decent drops over night/ intraday they did not gain as much value as I anticipated that they would. My SPY puts were the most frustrating. They closed ITM at about 6% red… and with the morning opening and a 0.3%+ drop I had only gone from -6% to -3%... I have no idea what was going on with that. I ended up holding until the 2nd drop and then felt like I was winning just being able to exit. 

MSFT was the same was too… closed down about 10-12% and with a -1% drop I had barely seen breakeven. Didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me. 

Something else that is funky this whole week is that the intraweek contracts so 3/2 and 3/3 spy options IV is extremely elevated. It goes from 3/3 puts having a 20% IV to the 5dte 3/6 puts having an IV of 15%. I noticed it earlier in the week and we still haven’t seen IV come down. Its like the week is pricing in a huge movement but its not happening. 

Overall though a good day of trading despite all the chop we had. Really only the bad part of the day was getting burnt in a call around 145pm that appeared to have a nice bounce coming up. Only to break a key demand so I exited early. I jumped into a put for the downside move and ended up getting stopped out on that big 2pm doji candle and then the next candle proceeded to dump. 

Outside of that this has been a pretty good week of trading.",03-01-2023
"Choppy Chop Chop… 2-28-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisWell what was looking to be a pretty boring and untradeable day got to be a little exciting there EOD. I actually was very surprised to see bulls push it up like they did middle of the day as most technical did not really support a move like that. However, as seen below a perfectly timed tweet seems to have coordinated perfectly with that massive $3.13 sell off. It is not common that we go coast to coast (HOD to LOD) but we sure did today…

Actually the most impressive thing is the fact that the final one minute candle dropped a total of $1.2. 

To me it seemed like markets were starting to forget about the whole 50bps hike thing and CPI being HOT… However, they were kindly reminded today and that seems to have fueled this sell off here today. 

With markets reminded of 50bps we could see a small continuation sell off tomorrow.

Taking a look at SPY here you can see we have a really nice black bear channel going here. There is also a tighter more aggressive bear channel (red) inside of that. That could very well be a falling wedge. If that is a falling wedge then resistance for bulls to break for an upside push would be 397.4 tomorrow. That level coincidentally enough was MAJOR support almost all day long. 

The biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50/200ema for the first time in over a month. Not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn’t even touch it. Despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that. 

I still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until SPY closes back over 400. We also have an established supply level at 396.42 that we did break back and close under today. This level could turn itself into nice resistance here. We have a large gap on supply back down to 383.81 and upside to 414/415.23. After establishing demand at 400.6 on 2/23 we retested that yesterday and rejected there. We should with that rejection seek on next demand at 388.66 unless we can establish a new demand this week first. 

Supply- 396.42 -> 383.81

Demand- 400.62 -> 388.66

Key SPY Support- 396.3 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.44

Key SPY Resistance- 397.3 -> 398.5 -> 400 -> 400.6

Taking a look at ES futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than Spy. I said I was worried that we COULD see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind. However, bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection, crossing the daily 8ema below the 50/200ema and closing under the daily 100ema. Now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here. 

Demand was established at 3975 on Friday which could have provided a bigger push up. However, we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here. With a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand. 

However, Supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988. With a rejection off supply and also losing demand here I am very much so bearish on futures and I am looking for that 3915/3920 area to be touched. I remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020. 

Supply- 3988 -> 4020 

Demand- 3975 -> 3915 

Key Futures Support- 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

Key Futures Resistance- 3975 -> 3990 -> 4000 -> 4008 -> 4020

Tesla had a surprisingly weak showing today. I would have expected more strength today leading into investor day. However, after establishing a supply zone at 207.7 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 214.24 and was unable to. With that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 196.3. However, with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way. 

Supply- 207.7 -> 214.24 -> 224.75

Demand- 196.29 -> 164.18

Key Tesla Support- 205.6 -> 202.1 -> 197.8

Kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema… but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there. That could come tomorrow though. One thing I did note that besides Friday the PC ratio is very low this week on Spy.

Today was another really great day trading. My only loss came from a put that I cut early on that huge run up. Overall a great day and a great week of trading so far.

"The road to 390… 2-27-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisWe are officially in the massive pre market move followed by intraday range/ chop trend… probably one of the most frustrating times to be a day trader as unless you swing (and are correct) we are left with the crumbs… Look at the massive pre markets we have had over the last 7 trading days…

Average open over the last 7 trading days is +/- 0.83%. That’s pretty dang impressive.. 

Today was probably one of my favor intraday SPY patterns… the classic 123 rollercoaster.. I have talked about this numerous times but essentially a 123 rollercoaster is 1) the initial move in this case the dump from 401.29 to 398.26… 2) the recovery in this case that is the pump from 398.26 to 399.51 and then finally 3) the final bigger push past initial low… in this case that’s the EOD push to 397.2 area. Its actually really refreshing to see this pattern play out today as this is how SPY used to behave and generally behaves in a healthy market… these massive V bottoms and Massive LOD to HOD reversals are NOT the normal even though 2022 wants us to believe they are. This is healthy and refreshing to see especially on a bear trend day…

Despite the pretty impressive 0.9% green open and the push over 401 this morning the bears were able to capitalize once again. This honestly reminds me of the last 2 months but in reverse… how many times did we see major morning dumps and red pre markets only for the bulls by EOD to take it green or at least recover most of the loss? We are seeing the same thing here… and honestly today is a VERY bearish candle closure… 

Taking a look at the daily here we had a previous demand level at 400.6 that we came up and attempted to close over today and hard rejected. Generally speaking when we have a demand level like that and we get a massive rejection it is very bearish for the future. Not only that but we kissed the daily 8ema resistance today and hard rejected it with the wick and we hard rejected the daily 200/50ema with the candle body. 

The most bullish thing that we can take away from today is that we bounced off the daily 100ema support once again. However, with the demand level rejection, and daily 8/50/200ema rejection I am going to be looking for a bigger sell off here on SPY this week. My target remains 390.1, however, we do have a previous demand level at 388.66 that we could bounce off. IF we get here and can bounce I will absolutely be looking for a play back to 405.8 demand. 

Current demand levels= 388.66 and 405.81. 

Key SPY Support- 397.7 -> 396.4 -> 395.4 -> 393.6 -> 391.5

Key SPY Resistance- 400 -> 401.7 -> 403.2

The futures candle with this hanging man candle with a beautiful daily 8, 50 and 200ema rejection screams downside to me. However, there IS a double bottom here off 3975. Bears need to break through that level tomorrow and more importantly close under that level. 

I am targeting 3920 support bounce on futures. If we are able to get there then I will 100% be looking for a bounce back to the 4000s. 

Key Futures Support- 3975 -> 3965 -> 3945 -> 3920

So Tesla investor day is on Wednesday apparently at 4pm… I thought about it over the weekend and thought some lotto calls for investor day to let ride would be a great play and well that turns out to be absolutely correct. However that ship has far sailed… a day too late for sure… 

Taking a look at tesla here we had that really nice hammer candle doji that also re-established 196.3 as demand on Friday. That led to a pretty massive bounce and yet another gap to the upside. We also have no held the daily 8ema as support and have closed over the 202.1 resistance it fought at all week. 

Our next demand level is 211.5 and that is where I will be keeping an eye on for this week and tomorrow. There is a very real buy the rumor sell the news potential with Tesla this week. 

Demand levels- 196.3 and 211.5

Key Tesla Support- 205.1 -> 202.1 -> 197.8 -> 196.3

Key Tesla Resistance- 207.9 -> 211.6 -> 214.2

The VIX was pretty much all over the place today. Despite the VIX pretty much dropping from opening this morning it did have a bounce off the daily 8ema which at the same time provided a downside opportunity for SPY. The one interesting take here is that SPY did NOT recover despite the VIX continuing its sell off. Watching the VIX continue to unwind while SPY falls is something very important to take note of.

Started the week off really nicely today. I am pretty happy with the day overall and I am even okay with the two losses I took. The first loss was on a potential breakout that ended up with a massive 50cent plus blip down that of course no one could have expected. The second loss I ended up cutting my put early when we broke through a key resistance. It would have ended up coming back to be extremely profitable, however, while I didn’t watch it the whole time I believe my -10% stop would have hit first. 

I did move up to a -10% stop this week officially and went live with that. So far so good obviously. It is definitely nicer knowing 2 nice wins breaks me even instead of 3 nice wins. However, will continue to evaluate as time goes on. So far so good and positive results there.",02-27-2023

The biggest story of the week really is the fact that markets has now given FOMC a 30% chance of a 50bps rate hike in march… Now do I actually believe that will happen? No not really… however, I do believe that with the way PCE data and everything else is coming in this week that we are going to see an upside miss on CPI. The most probable scenario I am seeing here is that we are flat to red around 380-390 leading into CPI… CPI misses to upside and we touch 360-370s. However FOMC will come in with a 25bps rate hike and that will lead to a market wide rally back to 390. 

The algos this week were definitely on another level…

The bulls attempted to break SPY back over the daily 100ema today and even made a convincing run for it there at the EOD. However, we did reject and we are now closing below the daily 100ema for the first time since January 19th. 

There is an extreme red bear channel with support at 388.2 and resistance at 396.7 for Monday. However, the bigger broader bear channel gives support at 392.5 on Monday. 

Even though this sell off has felt like a lot more… we have actually only dropped about 5% over 7 days total… and besides Tuesday really none of it has been continuous. This has been one of the most choppy dumps I have seen on spy in a while.

I personally think that the SPY weekly chart is the big story and is telling of what to come here this next week and March. We had a support line dating back to the October bottom and January consolidation area that we lost support on this week. Breaking this pretty massive rising wedge absolutely opens downside. 

Something I mentioned a long time ago was that with the JPM collar historically we see a trend for the first 7 weeks post roll and that is the peak or trough and then we see a retrace of that said trend until week 11. Currently SPY is playing that out perfectly which means we have 2 more weeks of consolidation/ dropping. 

We also just closed SPY below the weekly 8 and 20ema support for the first time since December. When you look back at SPY anytime we close below the 8ema and especially the 20ema it usually leads to a good sized retrace. 

My main target remains 390 support on SPY. However, if we were to break through that I would start looking at 383 support next. 

Key Weekly SPY Support- 396.3 -> 390.2 -> 393.2

Key Weekly SPY Resistance- 398.8 -> 402.6 -> 407.2

I actually believe that futures daily shows a far more bearish story here than SPY daily does. IF you look at the futures daily here we have what I have coined the classic “123 rollercoaster.” What that means is we have an initial break down (1) (this would be the move from 4160 to 3985) and then we have the relieve bounce (2) (this is the move from 3985 to 4035) and then we get the continuation of the initial move (3) (this would be touching 3920 area. 

This week we saw that massive Tuesday bounce, and really we consolidated, attempted to retake the daily 200 and 50ema, however we rejected and actually now will be closing below the daily 100ema. With Futures (and SPY) closing below the daily 8, 20, 50, 100, and 200ema for the first time since January 5th we should absolutely look for further downside. We have a classic bearish 8/20ema crossover and we lost, retested and rejected the daily 200ema which should also be seen as very bearish.

Similar idea here on the futures weekly chart. We are seeing a classic breakdown with a close below the 8, 20, 50 and 100ema supports. With that rejection and losing the key upside resistance at 4095 (407.3 on spy) we should be looing for a retest of mean which is that 3920 area on futures (390.1 on spy). 

Key Weekly Futures Support- 3975 -> 3920 -> 3860

Honestly tesla daily here is a tough one and a frustrating one. We are finally seeing weakness and we actually closed below that key support of 197.1 which should be a big deal specially closing our first full candle below the daily 8ema… with overall market weakness and assumingly risk coming off in the market Tesla should be one of the biggest to fall… However, it is still showing quite impressive daily strength. Last bulls support is going to be that 192 support. There is still a chance that tesla is just ranging from 192 to 215 and realistically I don’t like any plays here till one of those hard breaks.

Weekly wise here actually very similar to Meta we are seeing more of a bull flag/ bullish support bounce set up then I am on SPY and other tickers like Apple, MSFT, and Amzn. Now the biggest thing here is that this is an inside weekly candle on Tesla which generally speaking does lead to further upside. However, this is clearly at a decision point too. With Tesla still holding its 8, 20 and 200ema support here I have a hard time wanting to be long on puts on it just yet. IF tesla loses 189.8 and realistically 178 then the downside move is going to be large and aggressive. 

Tesla Weekly Support- 189.8 -> 178 -> 164

Tesla Weekly Resistance- 208.4 -> 226.6

The VIX gives us a whole lot of noting here too. On one hand this is clearly a inverted hammer/ hanging man candle and generally speaking could be seen as a downside candle for VIX or upside move for SPY. However, take a look at Friday on the VIX… obviously different setup but similar idea of downside on the VIX however, it immediately bounced. 

The issue is that there is SO much 0dte activity the VIX isnt staying elevated or moving like it used to. Yes at times it perfectly tracks and I believe we can enter/ exit with its supporting our move. However, people are piled in 30+ dte puts like we used to see… people are piling into 0-7dte puts here and then immediately exiting sometimes the same day when they are right. That’s exactly what happened on Thursday… if you didn’t see the article there was a whale who bought 26k of 0dte 4000puts on ES futures that caused that massive $6 meltdown… once he sold (took profits) on those we have a massive $6 rally. 

We are seeing it a lot lately with these irrational breakouts, 50 cent instant moves on SPY and just overall nonsense. 0dte is nice but honestly it is kinda ruining the market at times.

Honestly just a frustrating day trading and frustrating week trading. I started the week off pretty deep in the hole thanks to those 0dte ES calls I swang that got absolutely rocked. From there the biggest issue here was that the moves were so damn aggressive and so dang fast that by time I liked what I saw and clicked confirm/ send the premiums had already jumped 20-30 cents at a time. It was a snooze you loose trading all week long. 

And then of course the ones I did get in on absolutely got theta ate and I either ended up in the red and stop lossed or by time the move was done it got theta ate so much it never saw profits. 

One change that I have been considering for a long time is going to a -10% stop loss instead of -15%... I actually moved from a -20% to -15% sometimes end of 2022 and that was a big positive change for me. However, with these 0dte every day the pay out on premiums and moves is so small we aren’t seeing the same profits we used to. Not only that a day like today with extremely high IV only moved a total of $3.61 all day (intraday) that leaves absolutely no room for reward either. 

Its kinda crazy as I was talking to my friend about “what changed” when I went from 10-15% average wins to 3-5% wins.. and my answer was nothing… I looked back and the very week that SPY 0dte every day hit the markets my average win and average profits all took a huge loss. Win rate never really changed but I went from averaging 10-15% on most wins (using 3-4dte) to barely getting 5% most trades before it either reverses, iv crushes or theta eats me. 

This market is ever changing and ever frustrating. But in the end it’s a marathon not a sprint. And as I said all of 2022… everyone should be looking at capital preservation so that in 2024 or 2025 when a bull market comes back you have the funds to finally get the reward that most are missing out on.",02-24-2023

Tomorrow morning we get a doozy of data… consumer spending/ persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get PCE and Core PCE… with the preliminary PCE numbers along with PPI/ CPI we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in. I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers. 

The markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all… however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump.

The biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out. 

Bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength. 

However we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first? 

My thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish. 

IF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater. 

Key SPY Support- 400.6 -> 398.5 -> 396.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401.5 -> 403.2 -> 405.3

Taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018. 

The biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion. 

The biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though. 

Key Futures support- 4010 -> 3998 -> 3985 -> 3965

Tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now… As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn’t expect a bigger sell off… yet… The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming. 

Tesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown. 

Key Tesla Support- 202.1 -> 197.3 -> 191.8

Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 209.2 -> 214.3

The VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn’t give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable.

Not too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn’t work out. 

Only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe… to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn’t be expected… Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same. 

I was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google. 

Overall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405.",02-23-2023
"FOMC Minute day… 2-22-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisToday we finally get the FOMC minutes and here are some highlights from said meeting…

Overall the minutes honestly outside of the fact that a few members wanted a 50bps (which we knew) the minutes were as expected slightly dovish… however, this meeting if you remember is prior to strong jobs numbers, PPI and CPI numbers. I do think we are setting up for a more hawkish tone come next FOMC… depending on what march CPI brings… biggest takes for me is that some members would have voted for 50bps and the tight job market could cause higher and prolonged inflation…

Something I find VERY interesting is that this is apparently the most dovish minutes in 2 years… YET the VIX did not sell off post minutes and spy DID sell off post minutes… VERY interesting to see…

Taking a look at SPY daily here we have so far quite the bearish movement. We have a really nice 4 day long blue bear channel that is very tight and very dramatic right now. One interesting thing to note is that the overall falling wedge that we were in support broke today. Which means we should be looking for a bigger down trend and a bigger bear channel instead of falling wedge. As you can see the potential red bear channel I have here support was even broke today so for now we are trying to establish where this is actually going to go. 

The most important things to note from today is that this is the 4th red day in a row and not only that we attempted ot breakout back over the daily 50/200ema and rejected that. However, we did not quite break through the daily 100ema support at 396.6. As I mentioned before current movement would suggest 390 support retest is inbound. 

Key SPY Support- 398.5 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 394.4 

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.1 -> 405.3

Same story here on futures we have a very intense black bear channel for 5 days now… and we are looking for futures to close right on the 4000 level right now. 

Futures DID test 100ema here however bounced off of it but more importantly it rejected a breakout back over the daily 50/200ema. We also officially have a 8/ 20ema bearish crossover here too. 

Futures key support- 4000 -> 3985 -> 3965 -> 3945

Tesla announced today that its engineering HQ would be in California… short and sweet to the point announcement. 

The biggest thing to note here is that black breakout/ down triangle was officially broke to the downside today. Tesla also attempted to break through and close back over its daily 8ema however was unable to do so. 

Tesla did find a really nice support bounce off that 191.8 support area though. 

Key Tesla Support- 197.4 -> 191.8 -> 183.5

Key Tesla Resistance- 200.8 -> 205 -> 209.2

The VIX honestly is one of the most intriguing things of the day… historically speaking the VIX generally has pretty significant sell offs post FOMC minutes as the “fear” leaves the market and there is very little left to fear… however, today we actually saw the VIX drop slightly and then recover and hold its own. I am interested by the fact that the VIX perfectly touched and rejected 23.6 resistance however did not break yesterdays LOD. The VIX appears for the time being that it has more room to go. 

Tonight afterhours/ tomorrow pre market with nvidia, jobs and GDP is a really big day that I am very curious to see how markets will react/ open. Long term I still expect 390 before 405… however, a relief bounce back to 400 would be warranted.

Actually taking a quick look here at Nvidia earnings their revenue beats might be one of the better earnings reports I have seen all earnings season. That is a fairly impressive report. Nvidia is now testing on the weekly time frame that 215.6 to 230.9 levels.. it has seen two massive rejections up in this level so it will be quite interesting to see what Nvidia does not only tomorrow but Friday.

Overall had a pretty great trading day today.. had some 30-60dte puts that I did close today for some nice wins but also had a few l2l plays intraday. 

Today was tough to trade because we ended up having such aggressive and wild moves price action wise and premium wise it was very difficult to get into some plays… I probably missed at least 6 plays today that woulda been easy 5-10% wins simply because premiums moved so fast I never got filled and by that time it was chasing. No complaints from today for a fed day with elevated IV. 

I remain bearish till we either break back through 405 OR we reach 390… we are currently closed to 390 but I don’t suspect we will reach either by Friday EOD.",02-22-2023
"Beary impressive… 2-21-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisAfter a pretty impressive support bounce on Friday… I am very impressed to see that the bears came out swinging with a -1% red open and even temporarily hit -2% today. Honestly after pretty much two months of buy the dip… I have to 100% hand it to the bears for the work they put in today.

Taking a look at SPY daily here we actually are looking at a really impressive down trend over the last 3 days now. Now this blue resistance line sits at 400.2 for tomorrow which means bears got about $1 of upside to still hold same down trend. This also is the first time spy has closed 3 red days in a row since January which funny enough was right after CPI… Actually what truly is crazy is that the trend from last CPI to this CPI is identical. The bears impressively enough were able to close us back under the daily 200ema also today. 

We had a doji CPI day -> small \~0.3% green day -> then 3 red days in a row. 

If trend follows then SPY could be in for a massive green day tomorrow…

We have to factor in FOMC minutes… now that a 50bps hike is on the table (last I checked was about 20% priced in), with CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected and PMI this morning coming in bearish… we very well could see a negative reaction to FOMC minutes. However, much like most FOMC days the reaction to FOMC minutes generally speaking is bullish. 

For me looking at the daily here now that we have lost 405.3 and closed under it I am bearish back to 390. There is always a chance we get a retest of 405.3 resistance first however, losing 405.3 should open up a retest of 390 support. 390 is a major pivot point in this market and depending on our timing reaching it and the next CPI/ FOMC could start a catalyst for further downside or for a recover back to the 400s. 

Key SPY Support- 399.1 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 393.6

Key SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.2

Futures actually has a similar looking pattern with a closure under the daily 200ema and this bigger falling wedge pattern you see highlighted in blue. 

With a confirmed rejection of the daily 20ema without ever looking back and presumably the daily 8ema crossing under the daily 20ema tomorrow this is setting up for a bigger bearish drop. 

Bears have upside to 4045 to still holding falling wedge resistance tomorrow. And the falling wedge support will sit at 3990 tomorrow. 

Major downside target would be 3920 support area (similar to that 390 SPY level) if we continue downside. 

Key Futures Support- 4010 -> 3985 -> 3965

Key Futures Resistance- 4032 -> 4055

Taking a look at tesla here (and honestly this goes for the majority of Semis/ tech right now) we are seeing a clear rejection and breakout. 

For Tesla specifically we rejected the daily 200ema last week 3 separate times and despite its best efforts Friday and today was not able to get back there. With Thursday bouncing off the daily 8ema support, Friday closing over daily 8ema and now tesla closing back under daily 8ema support today we should naturally look for a bigger sell off to the daily 20ema. 

There is a bigger breakout triangle formed here on Tesla also. The daily bull channel has been broken as of last week so now our most viable pattern is this break out triangle. Support sits at 197 support tomorrow and resistance at 205. Essentially if Tesla opens or pushes red at all tomorrow we will confirm this breakout/ down triangle pattern and that will lead to further downside. However, if it manages to find support tomorrow and retakes 205 this could be a fake breakdown before a breakout back to that daily 200ema at 215. 

Key Tesla Support- 197 -> 191.9 -> 183.7 -> 181.5  
 Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 214.3

Taking a look at the VIX here we had that massive breakout of its breakout triangle… with a breakout here and a break down on SPY that could be further confirmation of more downside to come on SPY/ VIX. 

Oddly enough we are nearing that key pivot level on the VIX of 23.6. This is like the soft danger zone… when and if the vix crosses and holds over that level then we will see further downside on SPY and the market as a whole. 

After seeing the VIX relatively flat for the last basically 2 months straight the VIX has had an incredible 28.2% rally from Thursdays low to today HOD. 28.2% in 3 days is pretty incredible. And honestly its more incredible that SPY has only put in one -2% day during that whole time period. 

Actually its pretty incredible that through all of last week with CPI, and PPI that we on a random Tuesday get a -1% red day and the biggest/ worst red day of the year yet… seems a little interesting to me.

I swang futures calls this weekend and honestly I never looking at the VIX and spy on Friday would have suspected that we would close a -2% red day… at all. I would take that swing again and again. However, futures showed quite a bit of weakness throughout the weekend but oddly everytime it was looking ready to breakout it just kept getting slapped down over the holiday trading hours. But open it was so far gone that I was hoping for a small relief rally at open to mitigate some loss but PMI took us straight down and it was all over from there. 

After that honestly intraday trading today was not that bad. However, I would have been better off if I stopped trading at 12pm after my 6 wins a row (had a nice intraday streak of 14 wins in a row going). However, that 1245am reversal I had entered a put and fully expected a relief rally up to the 15min 20ema so mitigated my loss (so I thought) I then bit the call bullet thinking when we closed over 8ema that we would continue to breakout, however, we immediately double topped and I shoulda just stuck to my original thesis. 

Looking back I should have trusted VOLD more during that time period and while I was fighting trend slightly a relief rally is expected most days to the 20ema and the fact that we didn’t get that actually is even more impressive of a red day today. 

Overall not a bad day IV was also elevated today because of FOMC minutes tomorrow which did make the payout for options less than desirable after the bigger morning pushes.",02-21-2023

I’m trying to understand how certain stocks, or sectors, or whatever correlate to others. Like when X goes up Y usually is going down. Such as tesla to the S&P, real estate to healthcare, energy to whatever, etc. Is this an area of study that has a name? I can’t even figure out how to do a useful Google search for it.

"The bulls are NOT done just yet…. 2-17-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Recap and AnalysisNow yesterday in my TA I misspoke… I meant to say “the nail in the BULLS coffin.” However, I was in a rush to get that out leaving for gymnastics with my daughter and mistyped “the nail in the BEARS” coffin… but funny enough I actually correctly mistyped… what I means is that I actually am bullish here for next week. 

So lets talk about what happened yesterday with the 50bps rate hike rumors… now Bullard from what I understand actually hinted at that at last meeting and markets did not react. Now the market FINALLY with CPI, PPI and the 50bps took an absolute nose dive. Now the very interesting this is that despite that yesterday markets still found itself in a buy the dip movement today. 

Think about it this way… markets have pretty much been on edge all week long and realistically were hella overdue for a technical support sell off and retesting of key support in order to push higher… that 50bps hike was the catalyst. However, markets came to their senses in my opinion and realized that those two fed members don’t even get a vote… markets realized also that realistically we have another CPI before FOMC and honestly the sell off MIGHT be slightly premature… there is a very high probability that until next CPI and FOMC we find ourselves in a very broad $10-$15 consolidation period like we have now. IT makes trading extremely hard but as of right now there is not enough bull fuel to take this rally to 430 but there really isn’t enough fuel either to take us back to 390…. Enters consolidation…

Now earlier this week I asked the question “is 405 or 420 coming next?” well we officially have the answer that 405 was coming first… with 405 tagged and most importantly that support holding there is a high probability this push up continues next week. 

I remain bullish but only in the sense that I believe much like November to December we have found ourselves in a bigger consolidation range from 406 to 417.

This is now our 2nd retest and most importantly our second time holding 405.3 support on a breakdown. I fully expect upside early next week into FOMC minutes on Wednesday. 

Remember we get a really long weekend here too… generally speaking I would say most 3 day weekends have resulted in bigger green days and opens.

Economic data wise not a whole lot and nothing pre market Tuesday. FOMC minutes is on Wednesday though. 

Today was monthly options expiration and honestly it was a pretty boring day overall pretty tight $3.46 range day. 

Lets take a look at the last few monthly OPEX days… 

January 20th (opex)= 1.86%+  
 January 23rd (post- OPEX)= 1.2%

December 16th (OPEX)= -1.63%  
 December 19th (post- OPEX)= -0.85%

November 18th (OPEX)= 0.45%+  
 November 21st (post- OPEX)= -0.36%  
 

Overall looking at the last 3 MOPEX… there is literally trend at all… however of the last two MOPEX this is definitely one of the smaller movement days. 

&#x200B;

Now lets take a look here at SPY daily…

Overall we broke through that bull channel support but as I have highlighted here with that black arrows we actually look like we are in an overall upchannel and this very well with retaking the daily 20ema there EOD could end up being a bullish bounce. 

I have mentioned the importance of that 405.3 support area and how as long as we hold that we are bullish. 

You can see that double level at 410.3 to 411.3 and that should be our expected magnet. As in the further we get away from that +/- we SHOULD expect a rebound back to it. 

Todays daily candle structure today with this upside gap of 407.51 to 408.18 actually forms an amazing bullish abandoned baby pattern. This is a high probability upside reversal pattern. I feel fairly confident that we will minimally Tuesday touch somewhere between 408 to 410.3. From there we then start looking at a daily 8ema resistance retest. A closure back over that is extremely bullish however a closure under it/ rejection at it would be very bearish. There is also an overall with the red channel bigger bull flag pattern forming on SPY daily here too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vi7mv0vpauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7518e3dbd396a4d6bfdabf70796d2d2eb520d7

Now the weekly chart here is actually starting to look a little more bearish. However, if you look at the week of December 19th and 27th we are actually seeing a similar pattern here and with this holding the weekly 8ema support this could be an overall bigger weekly bull flag too. The upside push would get us back to that 417+ area. 

Taking a look here this 407 area has really solidified itself as a major pivot area here. Looking at the resistance from the week of November 28th you can see we actually have a really nice support bounce off that level here this week. After a breakout the week of January 30th over that level this very well could be shaping up to be a bullish support bounce and we attempt once more to reach the allusive 420. 

Key SPY Weekly Support- 407.1 -> 402.6 -> 398.6 -> 395.6

Key SPY Weekly Resistance- 412.3 -> 417 -> 422.4 -> 427.7

I actually looking at the futures daily chart am even more bullish than I am on SPY daily… and here is why… so we look at this 4085 level I have mentioned numerous times that that 4085 to 4095 is a major level to keep an eye on and I also mentioned that realistically there is not much contested support from 4040 to 4085. 

Today we came down all the way back to 4055 before we finally bounced… not only that but we ended up in a massive absolutely beautiful morning doji star reversal candle. With this reversal candle like this we should expect a push back up to that 4120 area. This 4085 support area if you look back at it was first rejected on January 27th. And then on FOMC day feb 1st we bounced off and confirmed that as support again. Much like on February 10th we had a biggest retrace and then bounce off these 4085 support area. Now that this daily candle body failed to break that key support and we have a massive wick to the downside we should expect a push back into the 4100s minimally next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xv8mq3qqauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=36d11880c7168ec65cbf97e1cca35dfbc0787be4

Now the weekly futures chart here is a bit of a mixed bag here… on one hand we hard rejected that 4150 level 3 weeks ago and now have lost that key support area of 4095 and failed to close back over it to end the week. However, when we look back at the week of November 28th/ December 5th it established the key level of 4075 and that level was retested and confirmed on the week of January 30th. With futures failing to close under key 4075 and bouncing off the weekly 8ema one could assume that there will be an upside push next week to retest that 4150 resistance area. Again there is a convincing case of a bull flag here on the weekly chart. 

Key Futures weekly support- 4075 -> 4020 -> 3970 -> 3920

Key Futures weekly resistance- 4095 -> 4150 -> 4225

Looking at tesla here we are seeing that we did once again break through support here on the bull channel but impressively after losing the daily 8ema at open and opening under it and rejecting that key 201.9 resistance for a while today we have found ourselves once again on a move to 215 next week. 

215 remains an absolute brick wall which actually reminds me a lot of the fight at 197. IF bulls can break through that level then we could see quite the blow off top before we finally see a major correction. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2zot6rlrauia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d67cc6be6321e11ec0e88ffc9af9d688b359623

The weekly on tesla is actually fairly bullish here. We had a breakout and rejection of that weekly 50ema and after last week forming that potential reversal doji candle the bulls managed to hold the weekly 200ema support retest. The fact that bulls continued to hold that weekly support remains bullish. However we have now come into this major 208.4 resistance level from November 7th. If bulls can break through that and close over that we might see a bigger push for that weekly 100ema at 223.5.

Key Tesla weekly support- 197.4 -> 189.6 -> 178.2

Key Tesla weekly resistance- 208.4 -> 226.4

So I have mentioned before that if SPY/ Futures is showing a reversal pattern (such as the abandoned baby/ morning doji star) and the VIX is showing the opposite pattern which currently its showing a evening doji star reversal (granted this candle body is very long for the true pattern… but with the failure to breakout and bigger reversal the pattern is there just not the physical candle structure) then there is a very high probability swing play. 

With the VIX having that massive 10.65% green double bottom yesterday and for most of the day threatening to breakout to that key 21.5 resistance but failing to do so and closing back at 20 we should expect a continuation sell off next week (on the VIX) which then should provide an upside push on SPY itself. 

We have seen these inverse reversal patterns (where spy shows the opposite reversal pattern to VIX ) play out time and time again. It is one of the highest probability setups we have and I will happily take it every time.

Overall not the best week of trading here… unfortunately put in three red days in a row (no help to CPI swing) to start the week off. That really put me in a pretty good sized hole. However with all things considered Thursday and Friday had a 100% win rate and I was able to be extremely profitable and close at a relatively small loss for the week. 

My biggest struggle this week came with that 11am to really 2pm price action. We found ourselves much like today stuck in some extreme choppy ranges that couldn’t quite break out. 

My biggest struggle this week came from the physical price action that we saw not being complimented by indicators and overall movement on SPY. Definitely a tough week but after three really tough days to start the week I was happy to finish the week on a strong note. It was refreshing to through drawdown stick to my rules and be able to turn in some really nice plays to end the week. 

Overall despite a red week i obeyed my rules, I didn’t break my rules and I have no regrets. Honestly even playing CPI lotto puts I have no regrets. When we look at the PPI reaction its actually mind boggling that a hotter PPI got a bigger bear reaction that physical CPI did… actually what is even more mind boggling is the fact that a non voting fed members whispering 50bps hike can elicit a bigger reaction that hard cold data like CPI can… but that’s the way these algos work. Unpredictable and at times untradeable.",02-18-2023
"50 BPS Hike… the nail in the bear coffin… 2-16-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisSo this morning as I said we had PPI and jobs data and there was a chance for quite the negative reaction. Well as you see below that data came in VERY HOT. PPI MoM went from -0.4% to 0.7%+ that is one hell of a rebound!

Now add what FOMC said about numerous rate hikes and CPI not being under control, CPI coming in over consensus and showing that the decline is slowing AND factor in PPI now and we finally might see the wind taken out of the bulls sail…

Something I don’t talk about much because honestly I am just not well versed enough in it to explain well enough is that bonds and equities have NOT been behaving correctly. We have been seeing this whole rally the 2, and 10yr yields massively rally along with DXY while you guessed it… SPY rallied too… those two should not really be doing that at all.. 

Now something that happened yesterday and post CPI is that the peak fed funds rate expectation has steadily rose this weak but the markets did not negatively react to that either. 

We might finally be seeing… that market reaction. 

&#x200B;

Now here is something very interesting to think about… We have been under this impression that we are going to continue to see 25bps hike rates until we finally get to the “end” however, today for the first time the idea of 50bps was introduced by two fed members. Now granted JPOW himself has not said he would do a 50bps hike but there is no doubt that he isnt done with rate hikes…

&#x200B;

Taking a look at the CME expected BPS hike for March meeting it has actually rose to 18.1% from about 12% this morning. What actually is more impressive about this is that last meeting a 50bps wasn’t even in question. 

So the question now remains… did the market finally put a nail in the bears coffins? Is this market FINALLY going to accept the fact that inflation is not over, and that we are not going back to ATH and that the market is actually not in a good place? IS this finally the end of this insane bully rally we have been on for almost 2 months now? We will find out tomorrow…

Now we have seen this time and time again where we break down and test the 20ema then bounce. However, this time really is quite different… we are actually seeing this as a break through of this bull support (again) and this also at the same time is a rejection of the daily 8ema. 

Now this long wicked candle here is not the most ideal candle for downside continuation but it can be a continuation candle. 

The biggest thing I want to note here is that we did clsoe under that key 408.8 support that most of this consolidation has happened in. With that breakdown it would be natural to assume that we touch 405.3 support tomorrow. 

405.3 still remains critical support. If we see that level broken tomorrow there is a very high probability that this rally is going to see an abrupt end and we could be looking at the 390-400 area by end of next week. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -> 402.9 -> 400.8

Key SPY Resistace- 408.8 -> 410.2 -> 414.1

Futures in my opinion is far more bearish then SPY. Something else that is very interesting to me here on futures is the fact that for probably the last 3-4 days if not longer futures has (as evidence by these lower wicks) been very red after hours and has seen major reallys intraday. Now that we finally (maybe) have a true reason to sell and futures already has been in sell mode.. I am very curious to see where futures is going to take us overnight. 

Futures here we also broke the bull channel support with a massive double top off of 4160. With that rejection there and losing the daily 8ema we are in store for a bigger support test. If we happen to lose that support this is going to see an even large sell off. 

What I am watchign for here is this key 4095 support. I will be very curious to see where futures closes here at 5pm. If it drops and closes under 4095 that is even more bearish and really would open the idea for a bigger dump tomorrow. 

The big level here is the daily 20ema at 4093. If we lose that and especially clsoe under that we are likely in store for a continuaton sell off next week. 

Key Futures support- 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030 

Key Futures resistance- 4122 -> 4160

Tesla caught a really bad news day today and we might perhaps also finally be seeing the end of this rally. 

We have not only a bad news day for Tesla but with SPY selling off AND back to back rejections off the daily 200ema at that critical 215 level I would nto be surprised to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. 

Tesla is now at a test of its daily 8ema and very well could find itself testing the daily 20ema down near 184 tomorrow or early next week. 

One thing to keep in mind here though is that tesla IS still in its bull channel. Realistically until we break that support it is only speculation on whether we are going to see a further sell off on tesla or not…

However, breaking below that going into next week could set up a very nice short opportunity especially If the overall markets are on board too. 

Key Tesla Support- 202 -> 196.8 -> 191.8 -> 183.6

Key Tesla resistance- 211 -> 215 -> 219.2

The VIX just managed to close a huge 10.65% green day today… this is the biggest move up on the VIX since December 22nd(9.57%+) and December 12th (9.6%+). 

This is the first 10% green close on the VIX since September 13th which was a 14.33% green day.

With the VIX double bottoming perfectly off 18.2 and closing back over 19.7 we could be looking at an even bigger push up into the 21-22 area tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough tomorrow is monthly OPEX and we have a really nice max pain down at that critical 405 support area. Earlier in the day when we were near 414 it seemed like a dream that we would touch 405 tomorrow and I would never take a trade strictly based off max pain but the chances of touching 405 tomorrow has significantly increased.

One kind of interesting data point for tomorrow is the fact that the put call ratio is 2.72 for tomorrow… that is about the highest PC I have seen in weeks on SPY. 

I wouldn’t be surprised to see a bigger dump tomorrow and we could even end up with a bigger EOD rally too with all that put OI coming off the books… 

Tomorrow could be one extremely volatile day…

After a pretty crappy three days of trading this week I was very happy to close out a green day… sure its not a huge green day and sure its still a red week but going 3 for 4 today was a good day for me. No complaints at all. 

Interestingly enough I took the first two trades before 1030 am and didn’t take that last one until 1pm. I just as much as I knew it was a buy the dip day there just was zero movement. 

Pretty much from 11am until 1215pm it was untradable and then we were looking for that bigger EOD bounce after Biden briefed us on aliens and well that never came. I have a pretty hard fast rule of Not trading power hour… have been burnt WAY too many times and was happy to sit it out even though I would have liked to have entered a put. 

I did take a put end of date on futures that I just closed out a 20.3%... will include that in tomorows log as that was technically a swing play and closed after markets closed at 415pm for the day. 

Overall tomorrow is Friday and it should be a wild end to the week. 

To me… a closure under 408.8 is very bearish for next week and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to see a bigger sell off next week. 

If by some chance the bulls can once again buy the dip and put this back over 410 we might see some upside next week or find ourselves once again in another sideways week.",02-16-2023
"At what point is an order too big to get filled immediately?I’m curious, at what point does an order become to big to easily fill for mega cap stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon? 

Could someone with a $10,000,000 account have orders immediately filled the same way as someone with a $25,000 account?

At what point does a an account become too large to effectively and efficiently day trade?

"Buy the dip continues… 2-15-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisToday was another one of those days where it was a clear buy the dip narrative. However, it was clearly not presented that way yet again. Now I know basically for the last week or 2 its been every dip is a rip… and honestly IF you went into the day with only the mentality that every dip is an opportunity for a call and you didn’t look at any other technicals or supporting evidence then you would probably be profitable. 

However, these sell offs are becoming more and more convincing and more and more supported from a technical standpoint. This isnt just a small retrace in price action to reconfirm support. These are pretty large retraces taking out major support and having a lot of supporting technical that they will continue. However, much like yesterday as soon as those technical show continuation we are getting absolutely rogue out of no where rips and then eventually technical come back to support the bull side. 

IT has become increasingly frustrating to trade SPY over the last 2 weeks now. There is absolutely no continuation and the technicals just don’t make a whole lot of sense at all. Major supports/ resistances breaking with support of price action and technicals are seeing rogue reversals before we finally get the actual movement one would expect. 

The more I look at the last 2 weeks of price action we are stuck in a range. However, this range is heavily being held together by the buy the dip narrative. There has been countless opportunities and supporting evidence of a large correction sub 405 coming on SPY since last week and we still manage to stay afloat some how.

We do get some more data in the AM with initial jobless claims and PPI. Will be curious if this PPI final demand expected a 0.4% with a previous of -0.5% will be negatively received… the feds have said how much they rely on PPI so a hotter or rebounding PPI COULD potentially finally see a retrace. 

But that’s only if the buy the dip narrative ends…

Looking at SPY here that range I am referring to since February 1st is 405 to 417. 

Overall we haven’t broken through either of those levels over the last 11 trading days now. The question still does remain 420 or 405 next? The case for 420 grows in my opinion. 

Something I wanted to highlight here on SPY was the post CPI trends from December and January. In December we had that CPI day that resulted in that massive candle. The following day we closed a small red day and then the day after that was a massive red day. Looking at January we had that range day much like this previous CPI yesterday. The next day was a bullish engulfing day (much like today). The following day resulted in a reversal doji that then was proceeded by a huge sell off. 

I will be curious to see if this trend continues or not. 

When we look at the daily we have an 8ema bounce and we have a bullish engulfing candle candle… that SHOULD push SPY higher and possibly retest that critical 417 resistance. That would be my target tomorrow if markets don’t negatively react to that data. 

We are still in that breakout triangle with support at 409.5 and resistance at 414.4.

Key SPY Support- 410.2 -> 408.6 -> 405.4

Key SPY Resistance- 414.1 -> 416.8 -> 419.5

Futures shows quite the consolidation here itself too but what futures shows that SPY doesn’t show very much of is these massive wicks to the downside. This means that futures is seeing some pretty impressive sell offs after hours/ during market close, however, intraday is pumping back up. 

This has happened quite a few times before and this usually signifies that eventually a change of tide is coming… 

I have noticed a lot times when after hours/ futures don’t match the intraday movement of Spy there is an imbalance in the markets… in my opinion generally speaking futures is rarely wrong… it just takes them some times to be right. 

Taking a look here we are holding that same consolidation on futures as spy from 4085 to 4193. 

We remain also in this breakout wedge pattern here with tomorrows resistance being at 4180 and support being at 4105.

Key levels to watch though that we have seen a lot of price action at is 4123 support and 4178 resistance. 

Key Futures Support- 4140 -> 4123 -> 4105

Key Futures Resistance- 4160 -> 4178 -> 4193

Somewhat surprising today Tesla actually didn’t show a lot of strength… it held within a fairly tight $2 closing range for a large portion of the day. However, after a sell off during Bidens speech it found all the strength it needed and made a massive push up to close at that key 215 daily 200ema resistance area. 

Tesla did close out a classic hanging man candle which could result in a drop tomorrow. However, with Spy and Tesla both finishing at their HODs tomorrow we could be set up for a large push up tomorrow. 

I still believe its far too early to short tesla but I also believe whenever this buy the dip narrative pops Tesla will be the ultimate short. 

Key Tesla Support- 209.5 -> 202.8 -> 197.2 -> 191.9

Key Tesla Resistance- 215 -> 219.1 -> 226.1 -> 229.8

Interesting close here on the VIX today back under that key pivot level of 18.3… If we look at the VIX this is only the second time in over 13 months that the VIX has CLOSED below 18.3… Everytime since January that the VIX has closed under 18.3 the following day the VIX has had a very large rebound. 

January 13th -> January 17th 5.51% VIX rebound and -0.18% red day followed by -1.58% red day for SPY  
 January 27th -> January 30th 7.73% VIX rebound and -1.25% red day for SPY   
 February 1st -> February 2nd 4.82% VIX rebound and 1.46% green day for spy followed by -1% red day  
 February 3rd -> February 6th 6% VIX rebound and -0.61% red day for SPY

What is actually the most interesting about this pattern is that all but one of those has happened over a weekend. 

Most of the rebounds on VIX resulted in a simultaneous red day for SPY but two times it was one day later. 

Speaking of SPY drops here is some fun facts… 

SPY has not put in 3 red days in a row since January 17-19th. Before that the last 3 red days in a row came December 14th to 17th. Both of these were immediately proceeding CPI results. 

Spy has only closed back to back red days 6 total times in the last 39 trading days… 

We also have only close > -2% one time since November 9th which was over 3 months ago now. 

With 11 trading days of consolidation within about a $10 range we are very soon going to see a move up or down.

Started the day off fairly well today. Got burnt in that morning call on a failed breakout… I cut early at -7.6% which was the right move as we had a very large correction then. From there I made a few more nice trades and then I got absolutely burnt by the market. 

I took a call around noon at what looked like the perfect support bounce at a key level only for the bottom to fall out on me. l then took a put around 1230 after SPY looked like it was confirming resistance and pretty much every indicator I have screamed puts only for SPY to get an absolute rogue shrek and of course wrecked that put. 

Highly frustrating trading lately. Actually put in my 3rd red day in a row here in a very long time. I looked back through my logs and honestly I couldn’t even find a time that I had 3 red days in a row between now and last May. Quite a few back to back red days but even during my terrible drawdown in July to September I didn’t put in 3 red days in a row. Definitely struggling this week with this price action and these reversals/ fake outs but we just keep on trucking. 

It would be impossible for every day, week or month to be green. But in the end law of averages will make us profitable.",02-15-2023
"Morning Briefing 🌞 Feb 15th 2023[Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1126pw8/morning_briefing_feb_14th_2023/). Yesterday I picked up TSLA 215c calls about 15 min after open when it hit 200, and sold right before close at around 209. Also got NVDA 230c around the same time, and sold when it touched 230. Hope you all Printed yesterday!

On Tuesday, the Dow and the S&P 500 both slipped due to higher-than-expected inflation, but the Nasdaq finished in the green. The pace of price increases was still seen as slowing down, which helped to mitigate concerns. On Wednesday, more data will be released, including indicators from the housing market, and corporate earnings reports from Kraft Heinz and Cisco. Additionally, Tesla has agreed to open up thousands of its charging stations to EVs made by other companies, which could help to further drive adoption of electric vehicles. On the other hand, Goldman Sachs has given up on plans for a branded credit card as it continues to dismantle its consumer-banking strategy. Finally, Wednesday's mortgage demand report showed a 7.7% decline in total mortgage application volume, likely due to a rise in the 30-year fixed rate. Yes CPI is over with, but remember this week is OPEX which means we could see a lot of chop. Yesterday was a prime example of that, but the range of chop was nearly 50pts so if you are trading today, use those relative strong or weak names to capitalize on this ES range.

**Overall Market Outlook: **

SPY - Bullish indecisive spinning top candle close on the daily TF. We are still in a big symmetrical triangle. And we are squeezing setting up for a move on the hourly TF. Looks like we could see a nice move tomorrow! (No levels posted for now I have a bunch of paperwork I have to finish up tonight.) Expected Move +/- $3.71

QQQ- Three White Soldiers candle pattern close on the daily TF. We are now in a squeeze setting up for a move on the 1Hr TF. (No levels posted for now.) Expected Move +/- $3.76

**Watchlist:**

TSLA - Bullish Engulfing candle close on the daily TF. We Engulfed the last 3 days! And we reclaimed the 200WMA on the daily. We have a possible head & shoulders on the daily RSI. And we released from the squeeze and made that nice move up! Take 225c or 230c Calls above 216.27. Take 195p or 190p Puts below 206.33. Expected Move +/- $12.39

NVDA- Bullish candle close on the daily TF. We have a tweezer top on the daily. And we closed in big supply zone. We still have a little gap above to fill also. Take 240c or 245c Calls above 231.20. Take 220p or 215p Puts below 225.26 BNH. Expected Move +/- $9.98

QCOM - The stock has come down to test its 200 daily MA for each of the past three trading days signifying the strength of this level. I believe we see a move higher for this chip stock. The semiconductor sector has been boosted by the AI hype, this outperformance should continue.

MU - This semiconductor stock jumped off its 200 daily  MA around $59 yesterday which should cause the stock to continue to move higher with the broader semi sector.

BFLY - BFLY is coming down to test support around $2.30 which is where shares had bottomed out in early January and May of last year. I believe this strong support level holds and we get a move higher for this name.",02-15-2023
"PRE- CPI DAY! 2-13-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market analysisWell lets get right into it… here is my overall analysis for tomorrow… I do suspect the highest and best probability of a payout comes from a miss tomorrow. 

CPI YoY is set up to come in over consensus and possible unchanged from previous  
 CPI MoM is set up to come in WAY over previous CPI  
 CORE YoY is set up to come in over consensus and possibly unchanged from pervious like CPI YoY  
 CORE MoM is the real wild card honestly. Based on the data I could beat, be unchanged or miss from previous. 

For me and I might be wrong I think markets are going to focus negatively on this MoM rebound and this will be the first CPI YoY that does not decrease by atleast 0.7% since November.

This is only the 3rd pre-CPI day all year long that the VIX closed a red day… the other two times were October which the VIX closed -0.12% and in May which closed -6.81%. All very interesting to be honest. 

The other very interesting thing about this CPI is that this is the first CPI with a new seasonal adjustment and weight calculation. We also saw this/ last week MoM and YoY CPI revised to the upside for the last few CPI prints too which is very intriguing.

As of right now with an IV of 40% and a PC ratio of 1.33 there is not much downside hedges put on and this is one of the lowest IVs going into CPI day that I have seen in a very long time… 

Tomorrow at 830am is going to be another very interesting day to watch. 

What impressed me the most was that the bulls pretty much straight ripped this green all day long today until 2pm. There is not a lot of risk off going into tomorrow. 

Okay lets take a look at SPY here… going to keep everything broad as we will get a better direction post CPI tomorrow and see where the cookie crumbles. 

&#x200B;

SPY has a really nice black support line here but also a really nice blue bear channel formed so far here…

Overall the black support line sits at 407.3 and the blue resistance line sits at 412.8.

If we push to the upside we should expect a push to test a major resistance at 419.5 which is about 1.6% from here… IF we happen to get a huge 3% green day we could see as high as 425. Above 419.5 the next MAJOR resistance is 429.8.

However, if we get a big miss tomorrow and a red open/ day we are going to start looking for 405.3 support (about a -1.8% move) and if we lose that the next MAJOR support is 400 (-3.2%).

Just as impressive here is futures that it opened and was trading -0.4% almost all night last night only to open green and close up 1.2% today.

We are going to be looking for upside resistance to be tested at 4210 (1.5%+) and 4310 (3.8%+) for our major upside resistance levels. However, to the downside the major levels at 4085 (-1.6%) and 4030 (-2.9%) red day. 

Again tomorrow post CPI we can see where we close out and go from there with some stronger trend and structure.

I honestly was kind of surprised to see Tesla red today… also today it spent almost 5 hours total today trading around 195. I haven’t seen Tesla hold that tight of a range for that long in a very long time. That was incredibly impressive. 

Major upside targets for Tesla are 202.4 (4%+) and 215 (10.5%+). Downside targets are 178 (-7.3%) and 163 (-16.3%). Granted I don’t expect 163 tomorrow but this week or next that would be my target.

Looking at the VIX what an incredible day for the VIX to open at 21.69 and fall al the way back to 20.37 to close at its LOD. An almost 6.5% drop on pre-CPI day for the VIX is really incredible and just shows how much bull hopium this market is holding onto right now… 

**Daily log-**

Honestly today was terrible day… I even called on Friday in my TA that we would likely close 410-414 area today… and well it happened and I didn’t believe it the whole way up… The red futures open and the huge VIX drop today threw me off and I kept waiting after the massive bull push this morning for a bigger drop that never came. 

&#x200B;

The other issue is that because IV/ premiums are so high right now I kept talking myself out of calls saying “there isn’t enough upside to warrant this play” and then it would push up and I could had 5-10% a few different times. 

Definitely not my best trading day today… I look forward to CPI being over tomorrow and seeing what this market wants to do… If we get a lower CPI and markets receive it well honestly I have little doubt that this bull run doesn’t continue… outside of a black swan there just wouldn’t be anything in my opinion to cause people to sell… 

Realistically for me unless we get a hotter than expected CPI/ CORE I  just don’t see what is going to stop this market right now… JPOW couldn’t do it… three of largest stocks all missing on the same day couldn’t do it… FOMC couldn’t do it… im really not sure what WILL do it…",02-13-2023
"2-10-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Market Analysis and RecapWe finally got CPI consensus this morning and so far looks like we could get a CPI YoY beat, CORE/ CPI MoM miss (big one) and CORE YoY unchanged to miss… I will post later this weekend my analysis for all of that.

Taking a look at the daily here I suspected that we would after failing to do so yesterday come down and touch this 405.3 support. Now I did fully expect this to continue lower into that 400-402 area today. However, incredibly we actually saw a ton of strength off that 405.3 today and I dare say that Monday this is likely to see a close back between 410.6 to 414.4 leading into CPI. CPI will absolutely be the deciding factor of 430 or 390 next. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mh8pnhp4mfha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=12ec70874d6151e3758ac7f19ba1e5077dde76a6

A few interesting things to note here on the weekly. We have that range bound red channel I have been talking about that we did actually lose support of this week and did close below. Now we also broke the 7 week long bull channel support also. Those two things there do show that this rally is quickly losing steam. However, IF we were to see a good CPI print that could trump that technical. 

IF there was no CPI next week I would feel highly confident in 30-60dte SPY puts back to 390-400 support area. However, as I have said there is no reason to be long or short on SPY until CPI is over with. 

Now something else to note and I believe I started talking about this back in December is that the 7th week post JPM collar roll generally speaking is the top of that current trend and then from weeks 7 to 11 we see a relief one way or the other. That would mean next week very well could be the top of the market cycle here and we could see a relief drop back to that 390-400 support area. WE could do that and still actually remain bullish overall. 

As long as markets hold 390and we don’t get extremely negative catalysts then I would remain bullish overall. However for me to go long again and feel confident in a longer dte 30-60dte play I really need to see a pullback to at least 400 to make the risk to reward worthwhile. 

There is not much to say this week just because CPI is likely to be a wild card and a big move up or down and the resulting days are likely to do the same. Until the weekly candle settles next Friday we don’t know what to expect next. Next Friday we will have a much clearer picture of a push to 430 or a drop to 390. 

Key Weekly SPY Support- 398.4 -> 390

Key Weekly SPY Resistance- 408.8 -> 417-> 427.5

Based strictly off the futures daily candle I actually am very bullish (when factoring in the VIX too) for Monday. I really do expect this daily 20ema support retest and 4085/4095 support test to turn into a very bullish situation for markets Monday. I expect us to close out somewhere in that 4130-4145 area. 

This is a really nice daily reversal doji candle. I will not be surprised to see a push up Monday. Bulls defending this 4095 area was a very big deal. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bjqsrgo5mfha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f83fce03f9f860e449a5f3e54d27d243612e5881

Slightly different structure here on futures weekly. We actually Did hold the weekly 8 week long bull channel support. WE did not break through that which overall send a bit more of a bullish picture. Plus we are closing over the critical 4095 support level (presumptively) here on futures). Bulls defending this 4095 level is a really big deal. 

Again not much to say here until we get through CPI next week and see where we end up. 

Key Futures Weekly Support- 4095 -> 4075 -> 4020 -> 3970

Key Futures Weekly Resistance- 4150 -> 4220

What truly is incredible… Tesla and nvidia both closed extremely red today. Kinda ironic that the last 2 weeks of SPY struggling at times with Tesla straight ripping it finally took a huge hit today. 

However, as crazy as it sounds and with absolutely zero chance of me playing it… the daily chart is bullish…

So yes we Did break the rising wedge support (again). However, we came down and had a huge bounce off the daily 8ema and also retook that key 196.9 area. This looks like it could definitely turn into a more bullish movement on tesla for Monday. Again CPI is Tuesday and that could very well be a market mover so no reason to trade this or speculate past Monday. 

&#x200B;

Now on the otherhand… Tesla Weekly chart is 100% bearish… of course this is where short term vs. long term differs… 

So we had a huge push up and a massive rejection up in the 200s and then closed back under 200. 

The weekly candle structure is a very large gravestone doji reversal candle… Actually similar in setup to what we saw yesterday on the daily structure (minus the gap up). 

We also closed over the weekly 200ema for the first time since beginning of November. However if you look back to that November time period you can see that much like the daily 200ema on stocks there is not usually a straight break through the 200ema. We could definitely see a pullback on Tesla next week to that 180 support area. 

Key Weekly Tesla Support- 189.9 -> 178.4 -> 167.7

Key Weekly Tesla Resistance- 197.4 -> 208.4 -> 228.5

Classic VIX here.. so we had a two day pretty large 11% total pump on the VIX. However, after another massive opening and push to 21.94 (the highest level since January 10th) the VIX unwound all day long and ended up closing a massive evening doji star reversal pattern. 

Now I have said this before… when SPY and VIX have opposing patterns (in congruence of the same thing) there is a very high probability of a play panning out for us. I did recommend swinging SPY calls however, I decided to sit cash. The only reason I didn’t take calls here is that with CPI on Tuesday we could absolutely get a huge rogue spike on the VIX. 

The risk to reward for calls is there but I don’t put it past the markets to suddenly care again over the weekend. 

Remember cash is a position… If it wasn’t for CPI I would have 100% taken them.

Overall this was such a blah week. Pre FOMC/ CPI weeks are also so tough because we have premiums so incredibly high on all 3-8dte that you need such a bigger move than usual just to see profits. Most of this week the profits I got would have been double if premiums/ IV were not so elevated. 

Also got burnt a few times playing the wrong bias. Overall was able to savage the week with some extreme confident larger than normal swing trades for today that played out well. 

Overall not my best week… not my worst week…

I really look forward to CPI being over with and being able to trade this well again.

"Doubling Roth IRA annuallyI am putting this out there into the universe, so this post is for me really. 

I believe my goal from here on out is to double my Roth IRA annually. I honestly don't think this will be that difficult. I finally have my style nailed and think I am done looking for ""better"", and I handled this entire year well. 

One thing is clear, we are all at the mercy of the markets, I can't double an account in a garbage year and I have no issues with that, I will stay cash during this time as has been my strategy and I LOVE being in cash. I didn't double it in 2022 and I had an off year in 2021. But from 2017 to 2021 I did amazingly well and I was up 200% this year and I think if my goal is to just double the account from here, by the time I am 50 I will have more money than 99.9% of people. Isn't that good enough? 

I love the TQQQ, I think its an amazing instrument and my general rule is that if I cannot outperform the TQQQ then I may as well just buy the TQQQ. Well after doing some poking around I did nearly exactly what the TQQQ did lol. It was 209% for me a 207 for TQQQ, crazy to be so close! My strategy is trading long options, no crazy options strategy, just looking for moves in stocks and buying options instead, it does pretty well. I have to say though this last few weeks was all AMD for my account, if it weren't for that stock I would have underperformed the TQQQ. 

This leads me to maybe re-think my strategy and maybe just do the TQQQ? But I don't know if I can psychologically do this! I am so used to the hunt, the strategy and having somewhere to put my energy that I don't know if I could just sit and watch the indexes everyday without looking for Tesla or Nvidia or AMD. 

That being said TQQQ is already my default, so I put money into that and then sell that to buy my options. So maybe its just a fine strategy overall? 

Part of me thinks as my account gets over a million size may be a problem in certain options markets, I recently took an NVDA options position with like 21 calls and there were 20,000 calls sold lol. So obviously in some pools I am a small fry, but what about when I am trading 1,000 calls? In smaller pools that will be super large. At the same time I see places call out options trades like that out all the time thinking someone knows something. Maybe that will be me one day and if so will ""they"" come hunting for me in a way I am not used to. 

Or do I take size and just do the TQQQ? I don't think there will be a problem in there, with 3.3B traded today I think it'll be a while before I matter there lol. 

I really want to solidify my strategy, I am a dreamer and thinker and keep coming back to the same tenants after all these years. 

1. Market Cycle
2. Leaders
3. Breakouts
4. Options
5. Cash

If I just focus on that with TQQQ as my cash position during bull runs and actual cash when were not bullish I think that will be the key. The question is can I do it! Shit...how can I not do it, what the fuck have I been doing for 20 years if I don't perform what I have trained myself to do! 

All I do is double accounts.

"regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans, sends valuation to $5bnElon Musk's company, Neuralink, which is developing technology to implant chips in human brains, is now valued at around $5 billion.

This valuation increase is due to some investors purchasing stock and the recent U.S. regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans.

The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.

Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.

After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.

**why is this important?**

1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested.
2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology.
4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink.
5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.

"Pre-Market Trading Report - Get Ready for the Day**Thoughts & Comments for Today, 4/19/2023**

Today as I said before, is historically a bullish day for the markets. I personally am expecting a green day for the markets, so please take everything that I said now with a grain of salt, as it is biased.

I do believe that the markets will come down over the upcoming months, and we will see a significant amount of instability in the price of general equities. I have personally started to hedge my account in preparation of this downturn and will continue to hedge my account accordingly when given an opportunity to do so. This is not a bad time to start exiting positions you lack confidence in but retain profits in, and this is not a bad time to start preparing to load up on cash.

A couple of positions I would recommend:

1. Start selling positions you lack confidence in
2. Set stop losses on all positions you do not want to hold until the end of the year
3. Purchase hedges either directly against your position or in indices like $SPY and $QQQ
4. Sell covered calls on equities you anticipate holding
5. Have cash ready to purchase and average down during the middle of the summer

"Tesla Stock downgraded to a “hold,” looking for additional insights!Like the title says, Tesla Stock downgraded to a “hold,” this morning and has been reported by numerous analysts, but I am looking for additional insights!

Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik said investors should hold off on buying more Tesla shares for now, downgrading the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy""

Here’s the [full article ](https://news.yahoo.com/analyst-downgrades-tesla-stock-after-50-pop-130116787.html)(From Yahoo bc the Bloomberg Pro requires subscription)

Tesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&P 500 and currently has a roadmap for expanding Tesla’s total accessible market by creating cheaper vehicles which feels good from an investor standpoint.

Aside from quarterly earnings that has been profitable, the odds Tesla continues to get downgraded feels high based on [prior reporting and valuations](https://www.pluto.fi/stock/TSLA) volatility. 

Any insights on steps is Tesla taking to maintain their competitive edge in the market, and how do they plan to address potential challenges from new and existing competitors? Looking at the performance of the stock alone, I’m not holding my breath but maybe holding the bag.",03-08-2023
Is Tesla having a pennant as a turnaround or a wedge as a continuation?,03-08-2023
"TESLA Short Trade Setup - Key Gap Fill Level = Retrace TargetHello Traders, here is a short trade setup for the beloved TESLA.

**To start,** the ideal short entry on a technical basis would've been at a pierce of $207 (Major Resistance) however I didn't create this post in time. It's still a great short setup and there is still plenty of room for profit, so don't worry it's not too late to enter.

**Short Setup**

* **Entry:** Current price, around $200.
* **Exit:** $141 ($170 if you want to play it safe)
* **$141 Take Profit Level:** *Gap Fill + .618 Fib = High probability of a retrace to this level.*
* **If price continues higher:** Add to short position at key resistance levels to average down.

**Short Thesis:** In general all signs point to the broader market reversing to the downside at some point in the near future. Once this happens we should see sentiment shift from euphoria (greed), to fear very quick. TESLA is a ""Risk"" asset and will be especially vulnerable to a ""fearful"" market sentiment and should see heavy selling once investors realize that they have been fooled and that the ""bottom"" is not actually ""The Bottom."" 

**In addition**, TESLA hit Major resistance at $207 after a massive move to the upside with almost no red candles in between. We know that TESLA is majorly overdue for a large pullback... the question is ""at what level will this pullback occur from?"" --- I believe that the pullback will occur from the $207 level, hence the reason for this trade.

Thanks everyone and I wish you all the best in your trading journey!

"Controlling Emotions with Position Size - Feedback Experienced Traders?Started trading a month ago, made almost 6% with SQQQ/TQQQ past month. 15 trades and 1 loser. I felt my confidence grow but now my confidence is messed with after a big loss, big loss due to not wanting to cut losses early and lose 1 of my trades to PDT rule.

Was getting so frustrated with PDT rule decided I'd go from 20% average position size to 200% using margin. Make it count, right? Would've made 6% with Tesla today but sold for 0.44% loss as it looked like it was reversing, so panicked and sold.

Is trading mainly about managing emotion? I wouldn't have panic sold a 20% position size but 200% with margin is like walking on tight rope. Should I switch to a cash account? Focus on slow and steady consistent growth which isn't very profitable or focus on big margin swing trades which I have poor emotional control over?

"Strategy Design Write-up no.3 - EMA/RSI combination v.1 Hey guys,

This is going to be another post on strategies that I have backtested and my thoughts on the strategy performance, as well as the backtest procedure and guidelines. I appreciate any and all feedback or suggestions you may have that may improve either the post layout, or the strategy design itself. Hope you enjoy this post.

**Part 1: The Strategy Ruleset**

https://preview.redd.it/xdh9he15y3091.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=19a924d46d6d4f41799daee742c64f58996e3218

So, in the last 2 posts I made, I used the exponential moving average, and the relative strength index indicators. In this strategy, I attempted to combine them to improve on each other.

This strategy is based upon a momentum crossover of the 8 bar EMA over the 13 bar EMA to the upside. The assumption here is also that a crossover of that magnitude brings a high RSI. The the exit criteria are as follows: Sell when the 13 bar EMA is below the 23 bar EMA, and the RSI is also less than or equal to 80. This should represent a change in direction.

**Part 2: The Assets Traded**

https://preview.redd.it/vcnkbjz6y3091.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67ed0091805f8b30a4e619177d40a5c65d82b94

I chose a relatively random selection of popular stocks. Following on from suggestions based on my previous strategies, I left Tesla out of the backtest to avoid ""survivorship bias"", or the fact that any test with Tesla in it is likely to be highly successful.

**Part 3: The Settings**

https://preview.redd.it/vgo1ith8y3091.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a9dcfbe504e47fbd3402146b0a3c7d6202b25e

Simple enough, similar to my last strategies.

**Part 4: The Backtest Scenario**

https://preview.redd.it/6w7moq9ay3091.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7b86f1cbce05e0ba9c27d21e686cc394f1b6a7

I set the backtest to start before the Covid crash, and to finish on the day I made this post. That gave over 2 years of data, which surely could be considered enough, even given the uniqueness of the market within that specific timeframe. Going on the hourly chart as well, would amplify the timeframe, as this would mean roughly 10 times as much data, over the daily chart. This timeframe includes many drawdowns in the market, which should heavily affect the results of the strategy if it is a poor strategy.

**Part 5: The Results**

https://preview.redd.it/0czx3evby3091.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43573b146a33cf0f499b3fd06774626a542d672

Not bad. While a B is obviously less desirable than an A, at least the returns were decent. An annual return of about 22%, in a timeframe including the recent large drawdowns.

A closer look into the results:

https://preview.redd.it/2trwz3jdy3091.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=68c9cf9ba2db91483b09271e563af37a53c45844

Worse than buy and hold, but better than the benchmark. And a decent risk score.

One thing I wanted to investigate more was the low winrate (I spent a lot longer trying to figure this out than I should have):

https://preview.redd.it/g1z35gcfy3091.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e86111f931ed36adf1ebab7ef38c0254ea20903

There were pages and pages of the above, for each stock. It can quite clearly be seen that many of the trades were closed as soon as they were entered, a potential flaw in the design of the strategy.

**Part 6: Potential For Optimization**

* Different RSI settings
* Different exit criteria
* Greater amount of stocks chosen
* Different timeframe
* Greater length of backtesting period

Hope you all enjoyed this post,

"Quickly review the most recent 100 opens of a specified stock?I want to review a small portion of the charts of a specified stock for the most recent 100 days. My goal is to look at these charts to see if I can find a repeatable trend or behavior during a particular time period each day. Is there any software specifically designed to help make this task fast and efficient? 

For example:

Let's say I want to review Tesla, and my goal is to review the last 15 pre-market minutes as well as the first 15 minutes of market open. And I want to see this 30-minute chart for each of the most recent 100 trading days ...

Is there any software I can configure to do this relatively quickly and easily?

My thought here is that once I define the stock, the number of days, and the trading period, a simple click of a button would show me the same time period of the next trading day, then the next, then the next, etc., until I have seen all 100 of the most recent days.",02-23-2022

"Broker will not reimburse me for rejecting my limit orderHi Guys. Looking for some advice here. 
Nov 10th morning as Tesla dipped, my $940 put option which expires Friday went really high in value.  

So I set a sell limit order of $16. The order kept getting rejected. By the time i could figure out what was going on,  Tesla had bounced back up n the option value had diminished significantly 

When i called the broker,  they informed me that because price of the option was $19 at the time(was volatile) they rejected my $16 limit sell order. 
Apparently, this is ""their threshold rule""!!!

Aren't they supposed to give me best execution price?

​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:

* Transition from wet to dry etching
* Improvements on the efficiency of etching processes used for ultrapure water (UPW) production
* Optimization of tools and procedures for UPW production process
* Reuse of spent rinse waters/wastewater streams

**Technical Analysis**

https://preview.redd.it/t1czlajwyno71.png?width=2668&format=png&auto=webp&s=3059e116466ab415138e2b06c6a15da5c42f7e41

Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.

**Conclusion**

The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates. Large fabricators have their own methods for reusing water but to be frank, are only scratching the surface. TSM’s Green Marketing Strategy does little to address the issue at hand. The semiconductor industry is expected to grow by 25% with water consumption expecting to increase by 15%. Aside from this issue, TSM has a comparative advantage over its rival Intel. TSM has a significantly higher market cap, lower total debt, and fewer liabilities. TSM doesn’t pay out dividends but instead uses the money to grow its business. Intel has mediocre dividends at best. TSM will be a trillion-dollar company in the next 5-10 years. Biden’s $50B subsidy plan will revamp production and should hopefully put the U.S in contention for the global semiconductor producer leader. TSMs new $100B fabs in Arizona will be a catalyst for domestic semiconductor production with growing support from U.S subsidies. TSM has a positive outlook for the next 3-4 years.

"Fisker Inc, (FSR) What happened this week and what happens next? Short Squeeze Potential? Hey guys,

For those that don't know me, I wrote the original FSR dd ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nn4j10/fsr_fisker_inc_duediligence_part_1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \- rest found on [r/FiskerInvestorsClub](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiskerInvestorsClub/))

In this post I will be going over what happened this week to the FSR share price and what I see happening in the future. I will be sure to keep it short

So first of all the Morgan Stanley PT was released:

"" Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley resumed coverage of Fisker’s stock at the equivalent of a buy rating, setting a 12-month price target of $40, or 122% upside over Tuesday’s share price. He set out a bullish case scenario Price target of $90""

After this, FSR rose 20% in a day. Pretty obvious, right? People see a PT higher than current price and want in.

But then Henrik goes and kills sentiment by announcing a $600 mil convertible notes offering

[https://www.fiskerinc.com/media](https://www.fiskerinc.com/media)

"" $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ""

Now, people straight away see ""offering"" and have flashbacks to every other goddamn company that diluted like shit and messed up all hopes of their share prices rising. But this is actually bullish, contrary to popular belief.

In the words of **Dan Gonzales**, the **Investor Relations officer** for FSR:

"" Hi all. I am seeing some confusion on the board here and I wanted to try to address a couple things: 1) We've been very consistent that the $1 billion FSR raised in the SPAC funded the Ocean program to start of production. That is still the case and we don't want to touch those funds for other projects; 2) As the press release says, purpose of this fund-raising is to fund the PEAR development, and other potential exciting projects; 3) We have great balance sheet now but the time to raise add'l capital is when you can, not when you have to (like Tesla always did); 4) Converts are very standard product and generally include conversion premium. Meaning dilution doesn't happen at current price but something higher. Capped call raises that even more typically; look at other convert annc'ts for example. Just wanted to add some facts and clarification. ""

These are also ""capped call transactions"" What that means is that dilution is reduced either way, worst case scenario is still less than 20%. Also, not being due until 2026 puts faith in FSR's ability to actually produce the PEAR vehicle, which reduces the main bear thesis that FSR will never actually produce a vehicle.

So now that we have the details out of the way, (check the links if you want more info), here is my theory and how I am playing this:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[15 min chart showing the previous weeks action. Note the massive gap up after PT announcement and the massive red candle before close today. 600 mil offering was the gap down](https://preview.redd.it/ylasi6h0wzg71.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=479d6d771142ac5f6c7828d4004e9b7b320ea5e9)

&#x200B;

Also interesting to note is the following, from Quant Data. If my math is correct, this is roughly 400k dollars in long term bets against Fisker.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yb1mmt15wzg71.png?width=417&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f859315daed36fe0815b9a0a51026ee17d909d8

From just before close. Same time as the massive red candle

It should be obvious what the play is here. SHORT SQUEEZE!!!!! I am not a fan of ""squeeze"" plays as 90% of them are not true squeeze potential. ""Apes"" and ""stick it to the hedgies"" types are what ruined reddit. But this, I believe is potential to make money and thats what I like.

Read my original dd to see my PT of $100 for end of year 2022, or $35 for end of 2021. At a current price that is almost 600% profit on share alone by next year. Adam Jonas seen what I see in this company, announced his PT and then the price pumped. Everyone who was short panicked, Henrik done them a favour by announcing (bullish) news that got misinterpreted as dilution, which stupid traders, theres a lot of them nowadays, decided to sell the news without researching. Shorts seen the opportunity to double down and are now 40% of the float SHORT!

If I had to make a wild guess, I would say they have an average short price of around $17.50, just assuming they were short first time at 19.40 (strong resistance according to crayons and what is resistance anyway, but a place where most sell positions were placed - aka a price heavily shorted at) and short second time at 16.50 down to 15 (the entire fucking red candle before close today)

Assuming anything above 17.50 causes pain for short positions, then it should be interesting to note the open interest on all the calls expiring tomorrow, mainly 18 and 20:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zvsi8zg8wzg71.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=2840ac3497169e7382e5e23979b91eb48eecffb6

Calls on the left and puts on the right. Open interest is the far right number, check out 18 and 20 calls. over 3,000 and 7,000 OI respectively.

This research paper titled "" *A Market-Induced Mechanism for Stock Pinning*"" (found on google scholar) essentially states that unusually large OI generally results in pinning to that price by expiry. By that theory, either 18 or 20 should act as a magnet for price all day tomorrow. From the paper: ""**We argue that if the open interest on a particular contract is unusually large, Delta-hedging in aggregate by floor market-makers can impact the stock price and drive it to the strike price of the option**"".

"Intel Due Diligence (INTC)**Introduction**

	How did Intel's co-founder predict the semiconductor chip shortage of 2020-21? Intel has been making some big moves these past few months. CEO Patrick Gelsinger is doing everything from building infrastructure and acquiring companies to signing contracts and securing partnerships. Intel is on track to stay ahead of the competition.  

**Moore's Law**

Moore's Law states three things:

* The number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years
* Research and development increase the speed and capability of technology
* The growth of microprocessors is exponential.

* Competition from TSM and Samsung

**Conclusion**

	 CEO Patrick Gelsinger has been making some big moves these past couple of months. Intel is securing its foothold in the semiconductor industry by building infrastructure, acquiring companies, and signing contracts. 

	Intel wants to increase chip output and drive down its average costs to stay ahead of the competition. Intel is expanding into the automotive, consumer electronics, and foundries industry. Intel faces stiff competition from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung. All three companies have announced plans to increase research development by 2023-24.

	Moore's Law is key to understanding how the chip shortage occurred and how to prevent it from happening again. Intel, TSM, and Samsung have all announced multibillion-dollar research and development plans in the U.S. The market for semiconductor chips is increasing exponentially.

	The U.S has been falling behind countries like Asia in the global semiconductor market. The U.S aims to secure global chip supply through its U.S $50B subsidy plan. The subsidy plan will boost the research and development of semiconductors in the U.S. Companies like Intel, TSM, and Samsung are now chomping at the bits.

	The global market for semiconductors is growing exponentially. The recent semiconductor chip shortage is proof of Moore's law. The U.S plans to expand into the global market through a $50B subsidy plan to attract research development to the U.S. Chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. You control the chips, you control the future.

"Elon Musk's Influence As we can see guys, after Elon Musk's excessive manipulation tweets on twitter for the market he started getting a lot of hate lately. If we compare the influence of his tweets on the market, we can see that it heavily declined. Today's tweet did not really pump Doge a lot (not more than 5%) as of before he used to be able to pump it for more than 10%. This could be good and bad. I still think that when he announces that TESLA will re-accept the purchases in bitcoin, this will affect the market positively and will have a good impact on it. Until then, BITCOIN will still go up and down between supports and resistances but will not be able to break the big supports and reach new ATH. It needs a push by an extreme good news!",07-01-2021

"Why cobalt is the new lithium: 81% to 450% price potential with cobalt mining sites like First Cobalt ($FCC) Hi all,

since I got some decent feedback on my first DD ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/m25llr/why\_deutsche\_telekom\_has\_a\_132\_to\_194\_stock\_price/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/m25llr/why_deutsche_telekom_has_a_132_to_194_stock_price/)) I wanted to thank you for that with posting a second one. This time it is commodity speculation. While lithium and graphite stocks already got their attention within the past weeks, cobalt was rather treated as the Plain Jane. I am going to show you why I think that cobalt prices and demand are currently about to rise drastically and why investments in companies like First Cobalt ($FCC) are a good vehicle to participate in that rise.

**1)** **Demand in cobalt is rising almost 500% over the next decades due to Clean Energy transition**  
**(e.g. e-mobility, battery storage)**

Several studies show that cobalt is, together with graphite and lithium, one of THE key minerals/metals required to successfully achieve the transition towards a clean energy society. The demand is (source: World Bank) is expected to rise by factor 5x until 2050, so almost doubling every decade over the next 30 years.

[Source: World Bank](https://preview.redd.it/i9j5g0qomfm61.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=479844d83bad3c460f832b32f087a7324228482c)

But why is cobalt so essential? Well, the demand is mainly driven by lithium-ion batteries, as you can see in the following study, showing the end market usage of cobalt from 2006 to 2020f. Cobalt is a key ingredient within usual lithium-ion batteries. The cobalt in these batteries has a stabilizing effect on nickel or manganese and prevents cathode corrosion that can lead to a battery fire. So as long as lithium-ion batteries are still the battery standard, cobalt is a chemically essential compound.

[Source: www.globalenergymetalls.com](https://preview.redd.it/9bqw1f7qmfm61.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd761879dff5b3f1996e0b1a58b9bcb6e32969c)

**2)** **Cobalt prices have a history of cyclical price peaks and current developments indicate such a price peak ahead**

With 60% of cobalt world production is from Congo (former Zaire) and 20% from China, the supply chain security can at best be described as constant danger. Trade war with China, riots in Congo, or rising awareness regarding working conditions and child labor are a constant threat to reliable sourcing of cobalt. Ladder concerns (together with a negative price peak) for example, forced Glencore to close the world's biggest cobalt mining site Mutanga/Congo in 2019. These instabilities can always lead to exponential price peaks as you can see within the historical cobalt price chart.

[Source: European Commission \(2020\) Raw Materials in the Battery Value Chain](https://preview.redd.it/ustbcqwrmfm61.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bc332bb29b132b88c0345e1d3b584e15d280079)

Now you’re probably wondering: when will the next price peak happen? No one can answer this question with final security. But when you look at current price developments, **cobalt already increased 20,420 USD/MT (or 63.44%)** since the beginning of 2021, according to trading on a contract for difference (CFD) that tracks the benchmark market for this commodity, **now listing around 52.610 USD.**

[Source: www.tradingeconomics.com](https://preview.redd.it/94sg8q7umfm61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab572f9620c28bc9296f8eea41c929d77a4c892f)

But is this the end of this crazy price development? Probably not! The all-time high of 95.250 USD in March of 2018 still **shows a price potential of an additional 81%** without taking any demand forecasts for 2020+ into consideration. So, it might be possible that we can reach **new all-time highs above 100.000 USD.** But at this point, it is speculation! No one can tell you for sure how prices will develop. Why some predict falling prices towards 42.940 USD others see prices above 60.000 USD or even a new all-time high ahead.

**3)** **To participate, invest in cobalt mining shares since no substitutes in form of cobalt ETFs or ETPs are available**

In contrast to other minerals like silver or gold, cobalt has no directly associated ETF or ETP (Exchange Traded Products). So how can you invest in cobalt then? Well, one possibility is using cobalt mining stocks as a substitute investment vehicle. When you screen the market for cobalt stocks you might read names like Vale, Glencore, or China Molybdenum. However, since cobalt only accounts for a minor percentage of their total mining output (e.g. 1% for Vale), their stock prices are not directly linked to cobalt market prices. Companies that are more suited as a substitute might be cobalt pure-players Clean TEQ Holdings, First Cobalt, or Sherritt International (at least 25% of its output). In the following, I will use **First Cobalt as a possible investment example**.

If you compare the stock price of First Cobalt with cobalt market prices you will see that there is an almost 100% correlation between those two chart developments. This historical comparison is no guarantee that the prices will develop in the same way in the future, but to me, it’s a good indicator. **So, if you apply cobalt prices to the stock price of First Cobalt, an all-time high price peak would lead to a target stock price of 1,15$/0,96€ (ATH of First Cobalt) - this is an increase of roughly 450% from currently 0,25$ct/0,21 €ct!**

[Stock price First Cobalt in Euros](https://preview.redd.it/doq7fjzxmfm61.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccf1ceae908503ccfe431a136235b7d7f3091a06)

Furthermore, I see more strategic advantages with First Cobalt:

* Mining location in Canada offers supply chain security compared to China or Congo mining sites. In case some conflicts or trade wars might arise, this stock will directly profit from that development.
* The name “First Cobalt” will directly steer potential hype investors towards the stock as soon as prices will peak dramatically. So, you could say that their stock name is a good “brand”

**Risks:**

No good DD is complete without displaying the risks involved:

* **Substitute technologies:** Mainly due to mentioned supply chain threats and human rights violations, companies like Tesla trying to reduce their percentage of cobalt used in their batteries (currently 3%) or even try to build zero-cobalt batteries. However, several studies show that the stability-problem is not yet solved, resulting in a higher risk of overheating batteries, reducing their battery lifecycle. ([https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17488626/elon-musk-cobalt-electric-vehicle-battery-science](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17488626/elon-musk-cobalt-electric-vehicle-battery-science))
* **Company risks:** since there are no ETFs or ETPs for cobalt, substitute companies might develop in a negative way, especially when investing in an early-state mining tock like First Cobalt. But in the end, such a high-risk investment usually offers high return probabilities.
* **Byproduct mining:** since cobalt is often a byproduct of nickel mining, cobalt demand might be covered by nickel miners. Based on the drastically rising demands of cobalt, I think that this scenario might not be realistic.
* **Closed-loop recycling:** battery producers try to reach a 100% battery recycling ratio. This might hamper the demand in the next decades, but as long as new batteries need to be manufactured and market demand can’t be satisfied by existing batteries, this should not be a problem for the case.
* **Price forecasts:** it might be the case that the cobalt price simply won't reach its all-time high or even a new record price in the future. So, this is where analysis ends, and speculation begins.

**Summary:**

In the end, I personally believe that a new price peak of cobalt might be ahead, and I invested a small stake in several cobalt mining shares since they are currently less overpriced than lithium or graphite stocks. If the speculation works out, no one knows, but as investor legend Andre Kostolany said: “At the stock exchange, 2 times 2 is never 4, but 5 minus 1. You just gotta have the nerve to accept and endure the minus 1” Overall, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not a financial advice. I simply like some of the stocks mentioned 😉

"The Reality of Day Trading Stocks In 20212021 has been off to a wild start in the stock market! There's price movement like never before with countless massive runners and massive trading opportunities on a daily basis. Essentially... **everything** has been going up with some serious momentum since the market found its bottom nearly a year ago at the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown. See exhibit A & B below showing the Russell 2000 *(small cap index)* being up approximately 140% and the S&P 500 *(large cap index)* being up approximately 80%.

[https://imgur.com/a/zFetDU6](https://imgur.com/a/zFetDU6)

With everything going up and and some massive pump and dumps everyday, *seemingly* everyone has been making a killing in this market. However, the purpose of this blog is to view the current market conditions as realistically as possible and cover some important lessons that will hopefully save you some money when the market inevitably slows back down.

Don't get me wrong, I hope this price action stays for good but that most likely won't be the reality. Eventually the 1,000% runners will ""*only*"" be 100% runners and people will be less eager to chase some of these stocks up to new highs. When that time comes it's important to be prepared for it because as nice as the market has been to us traders lately, it's also allowed many new traders to get away with some very bad habits that will prove to be costly when the market is no longer so forgiving. Take $SCKT for example:

[https://imgur.com/a/LDBY1hr](https://imgur.com/a/LDBY1hr) 

In a single day we saw this stock run from the low $3.00s to a high of $35.00! That means that there were probably countless inexperienced traders chasing this stock up 100%, 200%, and even 800%+ with no strategy or plan that were still able to make a nice return on their trade. Odds are, if they were to do the same in a more timid market, they end up with a loss on their hands. Plus, it definitely seems like there's no shortage of new traders lately. Everyone and their mother has turned into a day trading fiend since the GameStop short squeeze made it so mainstream. All of this new retail demand along with the fear of missing out on the next crazy runner have played a huge role in these newfound market conditions.

With all of that being said, here are some important things to keep in mind while still taking advantage of these current market conditions:

**1. Risk Management is key:** As funny as some of the memes may be... having *""diamond hands""* is essentially a guaranteed way to eventually become a bag holder. Managing risk is and always will be a major part of long-term, successful trading. Remember, it only takes one major loss to wipe out days, weeks, months, and even year of consistent gains! A scary thought, but it's not something you have to worry about if you take the precautions by having risk levels and/or stop loss orders.

A really great and widely-known example of the importance of risk management is the recent spike in GameStop's stock, $GME. The hedge funds heavily short-selling $GME should have been quicker to cut their losses before taking part in the massive squeeze that ultimately costed them billions of dollars. Similarly, the retail traders that were chasing the stock up near the highs, expecting it to run to $1,000+ per share should have been much quicker to cut losses once things started to get ugly. I'm sure *""diamond hands""* that are still holding their positions from $400 or higher are wishing they would have managed risk and cut losses long ago now that the stock is currently back to trading in the low $100s.

[https://imgur.com/a/wIwaLUk](https://imgur.com/a/wIwaLUk) 

**2. Penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason:** With there being so many penny stocks rocketing *""to the moon""* lately, it can be easy to buy into some of the hype that's being shared on social media (Twitter, Stocktwits, YouTube, even TikTok). At the end of the day, penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason! They're generally not ultra-successful, profitable companies like blue chip stocks may be and, odds are, they're not going to be the next Apple, Amazon, Facebook, or Tesla.

Don't get me wrong, they don't need to be any of those things to make them great day or even swing trade opportunities. However, when all the hype and pumping dies down in the stock, remember what kind of company you're actually invested in.

**3. Hope is not a strategy:** Trading requires strategy and planning other than blindly buying and hoping because some twitter pumper told you to. Again, the market has been wild lately so that may have worked over the past few weeks, but that doesn't mean it will work nearly as well a few weeks from now. While strategies will always need occasional tweaks to fit current market conditions, learning **real** strategies is the only way to truly set yourself up for consistency in any market condition.

Whether you learn strategy relying on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or a combination of both, it's going to give you some kind edge over some of your completion who may just be using the *""buy and hope strategy.""* 

*To summarize...* the market moves in cycles and trends. What works well during one trend may not work so well in others. It's important to not lose sight of some of the fundamental trading rules regardless of current market conditions because if you do, it can lead to costly mistakes when the markets shifts!",03-06-2021

I'm tired of getting into trades and have them spike all over the place. My biggest way is to look at the shape of the candles on TOS but it's not the most accurate.  Do you just have a certain method like ""this stock trades x share in x time""?, because then price, float, etc plays a factor into it (a $5 low cap will trade way more shares than tesla and thus have a higher volume, but tesla will still behave much better). Is there a certain indicator or scanner filter y'all use? Does what I'm saying even make any sense?? Thanks!",01-26-2021

"Biggest Stock Market Lessons of 2020**Just published a new blog covering some of the most valuable lessons from the market throughout 2020! Give it a read and let me know your thoughts:**

2020 has been a wild year in both everyday life and the stock market! We've seen the entire market crash and then recover to new all-time highs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen entire sectors of the market *(healthcare/vaccination, electric vehicle, energy, marijuana, etc.)* go completely parabolic, and we've seen some serious pump and dumps of 200%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more in a single day.

All of this volatility in 2020 gave us some incredible money-making opportunities and, whether you were able to capitalize on them or not, it also reinforced some very valuable stock market lessons that can be used going into the new year. The rest of this post will dedicated to those stock market lessons. *Keep in mind that, even though history often repeats itself, these lessons may not be as accurate under different market conditions.*

**1. Buy. The. F\*cking. Dip.**

Realistically I could probably end it here because if 2020 taught me anything it's to buy the dip! This year it happened to be a little bit more than just a dip, with the S&P 500 *(and its ETF equivalent $SPY)*dropping about 35% from its high due to worldwide economic shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic. It only took about 5 months for the S&P 500 to completely recover up to its previous high, which it ended up soaring past. Anyone that bought the dip would have been rewarded nicely, which historically has always been the case when dip buying the S&P.

Additionally, countless individual stocks also plummeted during this period, even though many of them hadn't been directly affected by the pandemic. These stocks also made great dip buys and, as you can see from their charts below, offered some incredible investment opportunities from their lows in March:

[*https://imgur.com/a/WCTMqB0*](https://imgur.com/a/WCTMqB0) *(Tesla $TSLA)*

&#x200B;

**2. Don't underestimated pump and dumps!**

Pump and dumps are a huge part of the stock market and, specifically, the penny stock market. They happen when groups of traders, such as large chatrooms or alert services, simultaneously begin to promote and buy the same stocks. Eventually, the pumpers cash out with nice profits while other traders that chased at the highs are left with a loss when the stocks gets dumped back down to reality. Although trading them sounds a bit sketchy, there are many ways to make a lot of money with pump and dumps. If you can spot them early enough, you can ride their momentum and sell for a nice profit before the dump. Alternatively, you can wait for the pumping to end and the dumping to begin to short-sell them and profit from them coming back down. However, with this type of trading strategy you have to be extra cautious that you're short-selling the reversal, not just a temporary dip.

2020 has shown the importance of not underestimating pump and dumps and avoiding being an early short-seller. Otherwise, you can easily end up wiping out your trading account if you get caught in a short position in a stock being pumped 500% or even 1,000% or more like we saw this year with $WEI, for example.

**3. Invest in sympathy plays**

The market has had no shortage of sympathy plays over the past year, and hopefully the same will be true in 2021! Sympathy plays are simply stocks that spike for no reason other than their relation to another stock that is already spiking. Usually sympathy plays fall into the same sector as the leading stock/company and will have similarly priced stocks. A great example of this is the electric vehicle section of the market. Of course, the most well-known company in this category is Tesla *($TSLA)*, but because of the overall popularity of electric vehicles in 2020 there's been countless other companies that have jumped into the electric vehicle market just to take advantage of the momentum!

These sympathy plays may not be as reputable or as investment worthy as the sector leader, but when there's a sector with a ton of hype around it, you can make a killing by hopping into some of the lesser-known companies early on.

A quick and easy *(and free)* way to get an overview of which sectors have been performing the best lately is to go to finviz.com and select ""Groups"" at the top. This will show how different sectors of the market have been performing over multiple timeframes such as the past 1 day, the past 1 week, the past 1 month, etc.

&#x200B;

**4. Don't fight the trend**

If you've been trading or studying the market for awhile, odds are that you've heard this rule. This is just a friendly reminder to trade the trend... **not** fight it! The reason this was such an important lesson from 2020 is because of the overall market. After the initial ""crash"" in March, seemingly everyone was expecting a 2nd crash to come shortly after everything in the market started to recover. This led to a lot of traders and investors taking losses when they tried to short-sell into the bounce, with the expectation that their short positions would profit from the market making new lows. In other words, they fought the trend.

With the market trending strongly in either direction lately, it's more important than ever to avoid fighting the trend. This means that you're better off buying into upward momentum than you are trying to buy at the exact bottom when there's a downtrend. The same is true for short-selling... you're better off short-selling into weakness than you are trying to short-sell at the exact high of a stock the is uptrending.

"QuantumScape Corporations DD!Greetings to all who read this,

today I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!

&#x200B;

**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**

Intro to QS: "" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. ""

&#x200B;

*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*

· Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)

· Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)

* “QS Stock Risk:

This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.

Our recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.""**

· Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.

· Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.

&#x200B;

*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*

· QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.

· Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

· More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).

· We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.

· QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.

· QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.

· While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \-- approximately $808 million.

·  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.

· Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that ""subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.""

· While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.

· Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.

· The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.

&#x200B;

*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*

## ·Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants

· Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants “will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.

&#x200B;

*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*

· Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.

* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.
* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:

1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,
2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,
3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%
4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and
5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.

&#x200B;

*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*

&#x200B;

* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (“QuantumScape” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company’s possible violations of federal securities laws.

&#x200B;

* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape’s solid state batteries that make it *“completely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.”* Specifically, it stated that the battery’s power means it “*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.”* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *“the power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.”*

On this news, the Company’s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.

[**Wolf Haldenstein**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxilkDLpHhrmI0w9pWxLiwZxzgbfa0LW6wu-ssajWNDjgU-zgz7CpsCaXj9SXd2mcPUg==) has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country. The firm has attorneys in various practice areas and offices in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The reputation and expertise of this firm in shareholder and other class litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed it to major positions in complex securities multi-district and consolidated litigation.

&#x200B;

* MILWAUKEE, Jan. 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating possible securities fraud claims against QuantumScape (NASDAQ: QS) resulting from inaccurate statements QuantumScape made regarding its business operations and prospects.

Click here to learn more about the investigation: [http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3025642-1&h=1038669832&u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).

The investigation focuses on whether QuantumScape properly disclosed the significant limitations of its solid-state battery products in order to be acceptable for real world field electric vehicle performance. Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for ""260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving"", (ii) have a daily range of only about ""75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions"", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.

**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**

[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)

For anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&oq=Quantumscape&sort=new&page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&oq=Quantumscape&sort=new&page=1)

Also, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.

I also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)

&#x200B;

Lastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.

&#x200B;

My Tl;dr:

* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.
* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.
* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.
* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.
* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.
* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.
* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.

&#x200B;

Also, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to CBAT, another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause CBAT to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \~$9. I am personally going long both.

&#x200B;

I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.

&#x200B;

The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)

&#x200B;

The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.

&#x200B;

It’s an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve’s inflation battle, noted FactSet’s Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.

&#x200B;

The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday’s close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.

&#x200B;

Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

That didn’t mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.

&#x200B;

Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.

&#x200B;

Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.

&#x200B;

The strategy “indicates the Fed’s measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,” Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks’ bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group’s announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.

&#x200B;

SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a “mini” banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.

&#x200B;

Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks — Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.

&#x200B;

See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?

&#x200B;

Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:

&#x200B;

The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500’s weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500’s overall return, he wrote, with the company’s success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",12-27-2023

"Looking to Simplify my Self-Directed IRAHey guys,

I'm looking to streamline my Rollover IRA portfolio and would appreciate your advice. I'm attaching a screenshot of my current holdings. My goal is to make my portfolio more manageable and efficient while maintaining a balance between growth, income, and risk.

I'd love to accomplish any or all of these 3 things:

* Diverse mix of stocks, bonds, and a few alternatives.
* Interested in long-term growth and some income generation.
* Looking to reduce complexity without sacrificing performance.

I'm open to suggestions on what to consolidate, remove, or any other strategies that could simplify my portfolio.

Thanks in advance

But here's the kicker – he's acknowledging that not everyone can easily snag a piece of the pie because, well, they're not exactly budget-friendly shares. 

Cramer's wishing for stock splits to make these big players more accessible to the everyday investor, aka the ""home gamer."" He's also got a bone to pick with the bearish analysts and media raining on the parade. 

Cramer's tackling concerns about Amazon Web Services slowing down, but he's not losing sleep over it. Amazon just dropped a collab bomb with NVIDIA, diving into software and generative artificial intelligence. 

What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree with Cramer's call for more positivity in the media, or do you think the bears have a point?

A - Ride it out and check back in a few years. The thing is, half of these I bought on margin so I’m paying interest every month to baghold these. I can afford to not sell the position because I’m bullish long term on Tesla and I don’t need this money now, but man it hurts watching it just go deeper and deeper.

B - sell short dated covered calls (monthlies) with a few strikes above current market since the $280C are pretty much worthless right now. But if the stock turns around in the short term, then I could be totally screwed.

"P/E ratio for growth stocksShould you use the median P/E ratio (last 5years) of growth stocks to value them? I know that P/E ratio above 30- 35 are difficult to keep over long period of times, but many growth stocks have median P/E ratios than exceed 35 by a lot. So it's ok to suppose that a growth stock will match its median P/E ratio again or should I use a lower p/ e ratio for the estimates(maybe the median P/E ratio for companies in the same industry? )
In general, how long can growth stocks keep a high P/E ratio?
As an example I have Tesla. Right now is P/E ratio is 68. And its median P/E ratio last years was 179. So will Tesla have a similar P/E (especially if they grow as analyst expect) or which p/ e ratio would you use for the next 3 years at least 

I hope I can be understood, I am still new in investing, but there are some stuff that still confuse me. If you could help me, I would appreciate a lot :)

So my understanding is it's difficult to accurate pick stocks for laymen like us. But besides that, I want to know if there were any companies in history where everyone thought the stock price will just keep going up and up and nobody could have thought the prices will dip and eventually it did and never recovered?

And also, what are you opinions on whether the current set of big tech firms that seems so invincible now, will they go down that path?

How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,09-28-2023
Charge pointI initially decided to invest couple of thousand into charge point stock after installing them at work (I am an electrician). Looking up into it they have 300k locations which made me believe that at lest the company somewhat knows what it’s doing (even though it hasn’t been profitable) and won’t go bankrupt and at the point of my investment it was 8 dollars a share which seemed fairly low from the looks of the chart. With Tesla teaming up with other car manufacturers to use their charge stations now the stock just seems to keep going lower and lower. Is it a lost cause or should I DCA. Thanks,09-25-2023

"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming yearSo I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",07-17-2023

**1)** **Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**

Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.

**2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**

Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.

**3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**

As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.

**4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**

Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.

"What Am I Missing?Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). 

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...

So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?",06-29-2023

"TSLA: Cybertruck’s About to Nuke Boomer AutoAlright degens I've been crunching some numbers that are gonna make you twitch. People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.

I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.

The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.

We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.

I smell blood, and I think you do too.

Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.

Even with that lowball number, Tesla’s got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That’s like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.

Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: 🖕

These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.

So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts’ expectations out of the water.

tl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.

"Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions 

Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company’s record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla’s NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM’s move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.

Nonetheless, it hasn’t all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck’s capabilities.

Preproduction “alpha” versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still “astounded” that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.",06-14-2023

"What's going on with Rivian?Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the company’s share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?

One bright spot has been the company’s increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivian’s future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% increase. Also, Rivian executives stressed their plans for profitability, which sent stock prices soaring. 

However, some larger issues still remain. Rivian is being forced to compete not only with rival Tesla, but other legacy automakers jumping into the EV race such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company. If Rivian doesn’t establish a strong foothold in the electric vehicle market soon, it may lose its opportunity to establish a presence in this growing market. 

I believe Rivian is an all-or-nothing play. Investing in the stock is extremely risky. However, the stock is poised for explosive returns if the company can work out its financial issues and deliver quality products to millions of customers that demand them. Currently, the company sits on $12 billion in cash and just shy of $3 billion in debt. According to FactSet, the target price for Rivian Automotive is $23.95, which reflects positive sentiment for the company even as it struggles.",06-06-2023
"regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans, sends valuation to $5bnElon Musk's company, Neuralink, which is developing technology to implant chips in human brains, is now valued at around $5 billion.

This valuation increase is due to some investors purchasing stock and the recent U.S. regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans.

The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.

Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.

After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.

**why is this important?**

1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested.
2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology.
4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink.
5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.

"Anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies via asset management companies?Hey lads! I’m sure everyone by now is pretty aware of the AI and robotics space as it’s literally all over the place right now. People like Elon Musk have been talking about it a lot recently and Tesla also just put out their newest iteration of their bots on LinkedIn which was pretty cool to see. I’ve always been amazed at how robots are able to do tasks in the same capacity we do so seeing it come to fruition is pretty insane to me.

I always do my best to keep up with news in the space to see if there’s any cool advancements or new jobs that these robots are taking on. That being said I saw today that “United Drug” who is one of Ireland’s largest pharmaceutical distributors has just brought in a whole squad of autonomous robots..and when I say squad I mean 21 robots lmao. That’s almost enough for a soccer match lol. The company partnered with LocusBots to make this happen which I found pretty cool because I had heard about them working with DHL and UPS before. Apparently these robots are able to navigate autonomously through the warehouse and assist the human staff (thought I’d add the human part on just incase lol) with handling orders. It’s suppose to increase overall productivity of the warehouse, which I feel like is going to be the case when you add in robotics in any capacity to somewhere. I wonder if robots are eventually going to eliminate a whole bunch of jobs in the near future.. What yall think? I feel like i can easily see robots operating a warehouse.

After reading through the article I wanted to check out LocusBots a bunch more and invest in them. Cause if they are making big splashes like this in major companies around the world I want to be in on them. It was annoying to find out that they’re a private company lol

I did however come across Stack Capital while doing my search into investing into Locus. From what I gathered Stack Capital invests in equity, debt, and/or other securities of growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I seen that in their portfolio they had already invested $8m into LocusBots back in 2022 so this could potentially be a good way to indirectly invest in them right? From the looks of it they have a pretty solid management team with a whole bunch of experience so I’m not super worried about their judgement when it comes to portfolio management.

Does anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies this way? I’ve personally never done it so I’m not 100% sure on it. I really love the look of Locus so I would really love to get some insight into companies like Stack and if they’re a good shout or not.",05-30-2023

"4 rental properties & home paid off, no mortgages/loans. 30 years old. What should I invest in with an additional $100k? (Advice Needed)**Hi team.**

**I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.

**My current investments are the following:**

* 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.)
* My home (Paid off).
* 2 Stocks (NIO & Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share.
* My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).

I have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).

My monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).

I know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.

So, I've heard the term ""mutual funds"" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms ""HYSA and Money market funds"". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).

So now, I plan to change how I manage my money.

**What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.

**What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account.
3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF).
4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.

So, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.

**My questions are:**

1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy?
2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.

P.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.

I appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.",05-28-2023

"Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock. 

## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.

The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.

It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.

Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.

Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.

 

## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance

During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:

* Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year;
* Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.

Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.

Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.

While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS). 

 By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.

Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss.  

Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.

 

## Didn't see this coming

Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.

Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile. 

While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business. 

 

## Is the stock a buy?

In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify. 

After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.

Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.

Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.  

I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.",05-19-2023

"Tech giants $ROKU, $TSLA, and $SQ battle it out for the title of best growth stock&#x200B;

 **Roku ($ROKU)**

Roku generates a significant portion of its revenue through advertising and content distribution services on its streaming platform. The company also sells streaming devices. Roku’s revenue grew 1% to $741 million in Q1 2023 and surpassed analysts’ estimates. It reported a lower-than-anticipated loss per share of $1.38, although losses widened considerably compared to $0.19 in the prior-year quarter.    

 

The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined 5% year-over-year to $40.67. The company expects advertising spend to remain under pressure throughout this year due to macro challenges.

## Is Roku a Good Stock to Buy?

Following the Q1 results in late April, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained a Buy rating on Roku stock but lowered his price target to $75 from $85. Explaining his investment stance, the analyst stated that platform revenue has stabilized, with upcoming tailwinds from advertisers, agencies, retail media, and DSP integrations.

Given headwinds from slowing ad spend by subscription video on-demand (SVOD) providers and higher “scatter market exposure,” Helfstein expects Roku to be one of the first beneficiaries of any recovery in the ad market.

Wall Street’s Moderate Buy consensus rating on Roku is based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and three Sells. The average price target of $69.74 implies about 25% upside.

## Tesla ($TSLA)

Investors were unimpressed with Tesla’s first-quarter performance, as the company’s earnings declined due to the impact of price cuts on margins. The company also cited underutilization of new factories, higher raw material, commodity, logistics, and warranty costs, and lower revenue from environmental credits as the reasons for margin contraction.

 

During the Q1 earnings call CEO Elon Musk justified the company’s pricing strategy, saying that a focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet is the “right choice” than lower volumes and higher margins. Musk expects Tesla’s vehicles to generate significant profit over time through its autonomy feature.

Following multiple price cuts, Tesla recently hiked the prices of several cars in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan. Nonetheless, prices remain lower than the levels seen at the start of this year.

 

## Is Tesla a Buy, Hold, or Sell?

Earlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target to $280 from $300 but reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst reduced his 2023-2025 estimates to reflect price cuts and their impact on margins. While Potter agrees with management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, he contends that this won't happen quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.

On the positive side, Potter thinks that the global average selling price (ASP) could fall by \~$125 per unit every quarter for the next two years without hurting margins due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Until margins and other fundamentals start improving, Potter believes that TSLA might struggle to “catch a bid.” Nevertheless, he remains bullish on the stock and expects investors to turn around in the second half of the year and beyond.

 Wall Street’s Moderate Buy consensus rating on Tesla is based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and four Sells. The average price target of $202.15 suggests nearly 20% upside.

## Block ($SQ)

Shares of fintech Block declined sharply in March after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of inflating the number of users on its Cash App system. The company shook off these concerns by reporting better-than-expected Q1 2023 results last week.

Adjusted EPS jumped 122% to $0.40 in Q1 2023, driven by a 26% rise in revenue to about $5 billion and enhanced margins. Results gained from solid momentum in the company’s Cash App peer-to-peer ecosystem. Cash App’s gross profit increased 49% to $931 million. Meanwhile, Square, the company’s ecosystem focused on merchants, delivered a gross profit of $770 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter.

Based on the gross profit momentum in Q1, the company increased its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $1.36 billion from the previous guidance of $1.30 billion.   

## What is the Price Target for SQ Stock?

Following Block’s results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $80 from $95, given the lower market valuations for stocks in the payments space.

 

The analyst highlighted that Q1 results beat expectations because the robust momentum in the Cash App business offset softer seller trends as volumes faded during the quarter. Tandon remains positive on Block based on the company’s focus on driving profitable long-term growth and an expanding product suite as payments continue to shift to digital channels.

With 23 Buys and seven Holds, Square earns Wall Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating. At $91.19, the average price target suggests 58.5% upside.

Tesla ($TSLA) stock vs. BYD ($BYDDY) stock: Tesla tries to halt the slide; China's EV Giant Races Into the Buy Area,05-01-2023
"Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023)THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong.

I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term.

IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more.

Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this):

1. Nvidia

I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks.

2. TSMC

The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B.

What I don't think are great for investment:

1. Google/Alphabet

Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS.

2. Tesla

I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why.

And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.",04-29-2023

Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.

With roughly one-third of the S&P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.

Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&P 500 this year.

According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a ""January Effect"" bounce.

The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.

 

Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.

"Buying shares post-split: good or bad idea?Many stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors.

Of course, it's critical to remember that a split does not directly impact a company's financial position or performance.

Several companies –  Tesla (TSLA $**TSLA**), Alphabet (GOOGL $**GOOGL**), Palo Alto Networks (PANW $**PANW**), and Shopify (SHOP $**SHOP**) – have all split their shares over the last year.

It raises a valid question: is buying post-split a good strategy? Let’s take a closer look at the performance of each post-split.

**Tesla**

In June of 2022, the mega-popular EV manufacturer announced a three-for-one stock split; shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th, 2022.

Since the split, Tesla shares have declined by 45% in value, coming nowhere near the general market’s performance.

Tesla reported earnings this week; results came in somewhat mixed, with the company posting a 2.4% EPS beat and a negative 1% sales surprise. The market didn’t appreciate the results, with TSLA shares facing selling pressure post-earnings.

**Alphabet**

The tech titan Alphabet announced a 20-for-1 split in early 2022. Shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 18th, 2022.

Alphabet shares have retraced 3.5% in value post-split so far, again underperforming relative to the general market.

**Palo Alto Networks**

PANW’s three-for-one stock split in mid-September didn’t get much attention. The company’s shares started trading split-adjusted on September 14th, 2022.

Palo Alto Networks shares have been hot throughout 2023, as shown below. Since the split, PANW shares are up 5.7%, marginally outperforming the S&P 500.

Value-focused investors may not find PANW shares attractive, with the company carrying a Style Score of “F” for Value. Presently, PANW’s 8.5X forward price-to-sales ratio resides on the expensive side, above the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average and the 7.5X five-year median.

**Shopify**

SHOP shares started trading split-adjusted on June 29th, 2022; the company performed a 10-for-1 split.

As shown below, Shopify shares have delivered a strong performance overall since the split, up nearly 50% and crushing the general market’s performance.

All companies above Tesla (TSLA $**TSLA**), Alphabet (GOOGL $**GOOGL**), Palo Alto Networks (PANW $**PANW)**, and Shopify (SHOP $**SHOP**) – have split their shares over the last year.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

"Time to buy Tesla ($TSLA) stock before Q1 earnings? 

Tesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this week’s earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.

With shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.

Let’s see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.

**Q1 Preview**

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.

The dip in Tesla’s YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)

Image Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

While Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company’s earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla’s profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.

Tesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.

With that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share. 

**Deliveries & Demand**  

The ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla’s quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla’s willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022.  

This would still fall short of Wall Street’s estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla’s ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock. 

**Growth & Outlook**

Tesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla’s growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.

According to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter.  

On the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.

Tesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&P 500’s +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors’ +4% and Ford’s +9% YTD performance.

Even better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors’ +41%, Ford’s +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry’s +88%. 

Shares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.

**Bottom Line**

Going into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Tesla’s annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.

Although the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be  rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease. ",04-18-2023

"Tesla stock dips as analysts warn price cuts will weigh on margins 

Tesla ($TSLA) shares are moving lower in premarket Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker delivered the fifth series of price cuts since January.

According to the company’s website, Tesla slashed prices on the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively. The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,” the company said in a press release.

The cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the company’s internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.

Tesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.

**What analysts are saying about price cuts**

While Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower prices, analysts warn that the company’s margins could be at risk. The Street sees Tesla reporting a 21.1% auto gross margin for Q1.

Wells Fargo analysts believe Tesla will miss the >20% target for auto gross margins. They also see Tesla reporting lower-than-expected EPS for the first quarter. Moreover, the analysts say Tesla will need to average \~526K deliveries from Q2 to Q4 to hit its 2M target.

“Our estimated auto gross margin ex credits of 18.3% is below guidance of >20% and Visible Alpha (VA) consensus of 21.7%. We forecast ASPs for $46K, also below TSLA's target of >$47K. Our Model 3/ Y pricing is down 12% vs. Q3, below our est. avg. price cut of 14%, reflecting model & trim mix help,” they said in a note.

Citi analysts add that price cuts weren’t surprising and are likely to place a further focus on the Q1 auto gross margin.

“A stronger-than-expected gross margin outcome would support the contention that Tesla’s latest price cuts are coming from a position of cost strength while also possibly reflecting lower input costs. An in-line/softer gross margin outcome could revive concerns over capacity/product aging while placing 2023 consensus estimates at risk since they call for improving gross margins throughout the year,” they wrote in a note.

“At \~46x ‘23 consensus EPS, we don’t think the latter outcome is currently priced-in, making for a less than compelling risk/reward into the quarter under the current macro backdrop. We prefer staying opportunistic.”

Finally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.

“We note that lead times were relatively weak (<4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \*except\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify.""

Given that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don’t believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.

“We maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,” they finally concluded.

Tesla Down 3% Premarket After US Price Cut Announced - Tokenist,04-10-2023
"Summary of recent news, and the impact on U.S. stocks **U.S. March nonfarm payrolls data mixed, leaving door open for another Fed rate hike in May**

U.S. nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 236,000 in March, below expectations of 239,000 and the smallest increase since December 2020.

The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, compared with a forecast of 3.6 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast of 0.3%.

With the release of the nonfarm payrolls data, one of the Fed's two most closely watched indicators - employment and inflation - firmed, U.S. bond yields lifted across the board, and the swap agreement showed the Fed's next FOMC meeting in May with another 25 basis point rate hike probability of about 75%.

**Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers: U.S. recession possibility rises, Fed nears end of rate hike**

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers said the Fed is coming to the end of interest rate hikes after a series of weak economic indicators were released and the possibility of a U.S. recession is on the rise. Commenting on the Fed's May rate meeting, Summers said it is clear that we are in the final stages of the current tightening cycle. Whether it is necessary to take action again, I think this is a judgment they should wait until the last minute.

**Hedge funds: the Fed policy is about to turn, the dollar may depreciate 15% in a year and a half**

British hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital released a report saying that the dollar could fall another 10 to 15 percent in the next year and a half as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve is about to ease monetary policy. Stephen Jen, the firm's chief executive, said the Fed may be very close to or may even have crossed the peak of its hawkish stance, and that means a rate cut is coming.

**Bank of America: How OPEC + Production Cuts Impacted April CPI Data**

Bank of America said the impact of the Opec + voluntary production cuts on the economy and monetary policy is likely to be fairly small. That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI component of the April CPI report is likely to decline slightly, as the lagged impact of earlier declines in oil prices outweighed Monday's gains.

**Undeterred by the banking crisis, individual investors in U.S. stocks still plunge into bank stocks**

Despite the ongoing crisis in the U.S. banking sector, the market still has doubts about the outlook for the banking sector and the U.S. economy, but U.S. retail investors continued to plunge into hard-hit bank stocks in the first quarter, pumping money into heavyweight stocks such as U.S. banks. According to data from Vanda Research, net buying of U.S. bank stocks soared to $769 million in the first quarter of this year, surpassing even the buying of retail concepts such as $Nifty ([NFLX.US](https://nflx.us/))$ and $Rivian Automotive ([RIVN.US](https://rivn.us/))$ in the same period. The company said retail investors even bought more than $200 million in shares of troubled $First Republic Bank ([FRC.US](https://frc.us/))$ during the period.

**Price war intensifies! Tesla cuts prices again in the U.S. by up to $5,000 per vehicle**

Tesla's ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ website showed on Thursday that the price of its electric cars in the United States has been reduced once again. And just one month has passed since the last time Tesla cut prices in the United States. The price of both versions of the Model 3 was cut by $1,000, the price of the two existing Model Y models was cut by $2,000, and the Model S and Model X were each cut by $5,000. In addition, Tesla has officially launched a new, less expensive Model Y with AWD powertrain in the U.S., priced at $49,990.

**ExxonMobil reportedly in talks to buy shale oil giant Pioneer Natural Resources**

ExxonMobil ([XOM.US](https://xom.us/))$ has entered into preliminary informal discussions to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources ([PXD.US](https://pxd.us/))$, the top-ranked independent oil producer and shale oil production giant in the United States, media said Friday, April 7, citing sources familiar with the matter. Pioneer Natural Resources currently has a market capitalization of approximately $49 billion.

***The key financial events and data for this week (4.10-4.14*** ***are as follows:)***

In terms of economic data, investors need to pay attention to China's March CPI data, the U.S. March CPI data and the U.S. March retail sales data, known as ""scary data"".

In terms of financial events, the recent ChatGPT concept, Shang Tang, will hold a technology exchange day on Monday to share its AI technology progress; in addition, the 2023 Ali Cloud Summit will be held on Tuesday.

As for the Federal Reserve, focus on the minutes of the Fed's monetary policy meeting released at 2 a.m. Thursday. In addition, a number of Fed members will speak one after another, which is expected to provide guidance to the Fed's May monetary policy meeting.

U.S. stocks Q1 earnings season is back, BlackRock, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase will announce results on Friday, the market focus on banking executives on the size of bank deposits, asset liquidity and loan loss provisioning related remarks.

**According to the above, the short-term focus on large technology stocks, this aspect of the market is relatively weak in the case of a sustained breakthrough trend, indicating that the short-term large capital in the field, so the operation is the same as last week's recommendations, continue to do more at low, there is a Chinese stock can pay attention to the bottom of the stage is determined, you can pay attention to the low point of low absorption opportunities.**",04-10-2023

"Tesla or KBE this week?Just wanting some opinions on my situation. Critique me on my mindset as well, im still very new to this. As title says, I have holdings in KBE and Tesla with some earnings coming for both Tesla and several banks including Citi and JPMorgan. Tesla I’m down 6%, KBE I’m up 0.5%. Should I stay where I’m at? Drop KBE and dump into Tesla? Or Drop Tesla and flood KBE?

Thinking this week will be a tumultuous week for banks and maybe a rebound for Tesla since they’ve been steady on deliveries so I’m leaning toward putting all into Tesla.

*I have diversified into other sectors, these aren’t my only two positions. Just something I’m considering to maybe take advantage.",04-09-2023
Elon Musk’s brother Kimbal dumps $17 million worth of Tesla shares on the market,04-06-2023
"Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule. Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.  

The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.

But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.

Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.

**Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule. 

Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.

Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.

Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.

PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list. 

Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.

## Costco Sales Weak

Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.

## Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.

The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed. 

## Stock Market Rally

The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.

The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.

U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.

The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.

## ETFs

Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.

SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.

## Bank Stocks

The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.

Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.",04-06-2023

# [Stock futures rise as Dow and S&P 500 look to extend 4-day winning streak: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures rose slightly Tuesday as the market remained resilient even after a spike in oil prices.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by 48 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 are coming off their fourth straight day of gains, rising nearly 1% and 0.4% on Monday. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, slipped 0.3%.
*****
> Markets have been resilient of late, with the major averages rising even when faced by persistent inflation, a banking crisis and higher rates.
*****
> This week, the energy market became another potential source of uncertainty, after OPEC+ announced it was slashing output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day. West Texas Intermediate futures had their biggest daily gain in nearly a year on the news. On Tuesday, crude rose another 1%.
*****
> “Given the transition the world is undergoing as it embraces ‘clean and green energy,’ OPEC+ understands all too well that its still highly valued ‘liquid gold’ will at some point begin to lose its shine,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.
*****
> “Until then, as the countries dominating OPEC+ prepare for the future by spending trillions of dollars rebuilding infrastructure and refocusing away from crude oil as their primary source of income, managing the price of crude will be used more directly and aggressively than was anticipated,” she added.
*****
> Analysts say the prospect of higher oil prices could stoke inflation and recession fears, but Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said she doesn’t expect markets to price in a recession a second time after the “pretty severe” bear market in 2022. If there is some volatility, it’s more likely to be a “normal” correction of between 5% and 15% that sets the market up for a better second half, she said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “We do think we’re headed toward a period of consolidation, maybe some volatility,” she said, highlighting earnings, market expectations of Fed policy and a slowdown in lending amid the banking crises as three incremental headwinds.
*****
> On Tuesday investors will get the latest number from the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, at 10 a.m. ET.
