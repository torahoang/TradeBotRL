"NVIDIA's $30 billion net retail buy-in in 2024 and when NVIDIA's market cap will overtake Apple's with the rise of artificial intelligence

Retail investors bought nearly $30 billion of NVIDIA stock this year through Dec. 17, making it the company with the largest retail inflow this year, according to Vanda research data. That's nearly twice as much as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a large-cap U.S. stock ETF, and is on track to overtake Tesla, which will be ‚ÄúRetail's Favorite Stock‚Äù in 2023

Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda, said, ‚ÄúNVIDIA's stock price has risen so spectacularly that it has stolen the limelight from Tesla.‚Äù



„ÄÄ„ÄÄ



NVIDIA has been favored by investors large and small over the past year or so. Last month, NVIDIA officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average and was the top performer among the index's 30 components. Despite slightly volatile trading in December, NVIDIA is still on track to realize a gain of more than 180% by the end of 2024. Today, its market capitalization has surpassed $3 trillion, making it the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, behind Apple.



„ÄÄ„ÄÄ



NVIDIA's retail investor position has also increased significantly. According to Vanda's data, NVIDIA's weighting in retail portfolios has risen from 5.5% earlier this year to more than 10%. Currently, NVIDIA is the second-largest position for retail investors, behind Tesla. This year, net inflows of retail money into NVIDIA are up more than 885% from three years ago.

"Nvidia Will Be the next Intel, Why I'm bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.",12-20-2024

"Self-driving business grows 6x, Uber is clearly misplaced by the market and is on the verge of 50% upsideShares of Uber ( NYSE: UBER ) have fallen more than 30% from their October 2024 highs in just a few weeks on concerns that self-driving cars could eliminate intermediary services:

https://preview.redd.it/ncqr7mkton7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5be5fc6a2808eb552fe5efa419afcff986c0b184

While news such as Google's Waymo skipping Uber to enter the self-driving cab business in Miami is thought-provoking enough to make some investors uneasy, Uber's positioning as the ‚Äútransportation app for everyone‚Äù - an aggregator of all transportation needs for more than 160 million consumers - makes it an inevitable market platform for self-driving car companies. This makes it an inevitable market platform for self-driving car companies. Tesla and Google have deep pockets, but building a bilateral network of self-driving cabs from scratch would cost (and burn) tens of billions of dollars, take years to achieve scalable economics, and make it difficult to change customer behavior - despite the novelty of driverless cabs. Additionally, Uber has partnered with several AV providers to bring self-driving cabs to its platform:

https://preview.redd.it/i0vyye8yon7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f17b6075787a9b0dc4af67c37e0ebe7b6c46100c

From an economic standpoint, it makes more sense to partner with Uber as an AV supplier than to try to create demand on a new network of self-driving cabs with a limited and expensive AV fleet.



Now, in the past, Uber's leadership team has used self-driving cars as TAM extenders, which is the right thought process, as increased supply in the form of robo-taxis could potentially lower Uber's cost-per-mile, which in turn would push penetration and total bookings higher!

The growth of the self-driving car market will unfold over the next decade or two, so it seems premature to abandon Uber based on concerns about disintermediation. As long as Uber's business grows as planned, there's no reason to panic sell. On the contrary, Uber stock's recent decline has significantly improved its long-term risk/reward, with TQI's five-year expected compound annual growth rate for Uber jumping from \~16.1% to \~25.8%.



Based on forward-looking estimates, Uber's revenue will continue to grow at a healthy double-digit rate over the next five years:



https://preview.redd.it/y0bde0y4pn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e92a4ff9d1b41574336c2d841cbb17ce75c5bdf

As a result, in today's valuation, the analysts are sticking with the growth and margin assumptions used in their previous assessment of Uber. That is, updating Uber's revenue base to $43.71 billion (2024 consensus revenue estimate) and updating the stock count to 2.154 billion shares. All other assumptions remain unchanged and relatively simple.

Based on the valuation model, Uber's fair value is approximately $105.50 per share, or currently undervalued by approximately 45%. In addition, given the sharp decline, Uber's long-term risk/reward has improved considerably. Given its 5-year expected compound annual growth rate is currently about 25.8% - well above our 15% investment threshold rate.



In a historically expensive stock market, Uber is now one of the few large tech stocks that offer amazing value!

https://preview.redd.it/1wyr2j2hpn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=94716206e12d6b22ee6b1f7abcb0115526bcf317

Uber is making every effort to become a reliable money-printing machine. Given Uber's fast-growing cash flow production and the shareholder-friendly capital allocation policies adopted by management, investors had plenty of margin of safety in this large tech stock.



Now, Uber stock is finally pulling back. Yes, Uber's image has been poor due to recent self-driving cab developments; however, Uber's business is in good shape with continued strong sales and profitability growth:

https://preview.redd.it/h06e8jinpn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba2cf41a6dc09ec5267d660fe0b4693a62526151

In Q3 2024, Uber's total bookings increased 16% year-over-year to $40.97 billion, driven by healthy growth in MAPC \[up 13% year-over-year\] and MAPC usage frequency \[up 4% year-over-year\]. Additionally, Uber's cash conversion continued to improve at a rapid pace in Q3, with free cash flow increasing +133% year-over-year to $2.1 billion.

https://preview.redd.it/bmsuyee0qn7e1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d822979f73322203f554899b398941453619e7d9

From a technical perspective, Uber shares are above the 100-week moving average, which could be strong support. Additionally, the 200-week moving average is at $47. Given that Uber's weekly RSI is near oversold territory, the $47-$57 range is a strong buy zone for long-term investors.

What are you guys thinking about this?",12-16-2024
"Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gambleTesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump‚Äôs victory and Elon Musk‚Äôs instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon‚Äôs influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout‚Äîa potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla‚Äôs data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla‚Äôs fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a ‚Äúshadow trainer‚Äù for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases‚Äîrare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla‚Äôs massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla‚Äôs vision-only approach‚Äîusing cameras without lidar‚Äîmakes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it‚Äôs possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.¬† The result is a more diverse dataset that‚Äôs constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google‚Äôs parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.¬† Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.¬† Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.¬† But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.¬† This means that its data is much richer in quality.¬† The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla‚Äôs suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn‚Äôt just an incremental step‚Äîit‚Äôs an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments‚Äîplaces like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla‚Äôs FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.‚Äù If Waymo‚Äôs AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it‚Äôs far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla‚Äôs suburban data might create a ‚Äúsame-shit-different-day‚Äù scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla‚Äôs liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.¬† Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla‚Äôs data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics‚Äîwhich is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo‚Äôs reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn‚Äôt hold weight for two reasons.¬† First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla‚Äôs camera-only system.¬† Ironically, Elon‚Äôs first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be that way.¬† Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.¬† When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?¬† Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It‚Äôs AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo‚Äôs superior compute power (via Google‚Äôs custom TPUs) means it‚Äôs clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon‚Äôs dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla‚Äôs superior approach. But they overlook Google‚Äôs hegemony in AI.¬† They were in the game before anyone.¬† They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla‚Äôs Dojo may be promising, but it‚Äôs still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla‚Äôs $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.¬† If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo‚Äôs technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

Tesla PlayI have been buying some Tesla Options for January 2026 since before the election. My thesis is that robots are closer than we think and they have been doing amazing work with the self driving. I decided to sell some of my MSTR options to get a bigger leap on tesla which i think Tesla can be a 1k stock at some point next year. Below is my options for Tesla and let's see how this pans out. See you guys on the other side! ,12-11-2024

"Rising Tesla üöÄ Curious what people here think? Is it because Elon is best pals with the next administration?

Or is it FSD?

I‚Äôm really not sure why being pals serves as a catalyst unless the stock was suppressed due to China / US issues? But doesn‚Äôt this mean those issues can be exacerbated next 4 years?

Is it FSD? I don‚Äôt see California and other states approving it, no matter how ‚Äúlax‚Äù the federal government gets if Elon engages in corruption. Each state has their own licensing and investigations irrespective of the federal regulatory body.

Or is this just shorts unwinding?

Any one with insight?

"$RIVN is the new $CVNA Let‚Äôs do a concise yet precise DD on this turd machine called $RIVN. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into too much details because I feel lazy as fuck and you‚Äôll eventually just yolo your money into some stupid short term option that will make you feel like you‚Äôre doing crack while going to $0. Burp. 

Bullish points 

- Gen 2 has a much more cost efficient build that was made very clear by CEO during last earning call. He even said ‚ÄúBlock the noise, we are having great progress with our Gen 2‚Ä¶‚Äù. If this turn out to be fake then I‚Äôll short it to $0 because using this terminology means business. If he can‚Äôt deliver or just lied then he toast. 

- The turnaround story must be real, they must be fighting every second of every day to reduce costs and survive. What did this kind of management behaviour gave as a result for $CVNA ? Don‚Äôt start to touch yourself i‚Äôm not done yet. 

- The market sentiment is almost at an all time low, and rightfully so as they navigate a bunch of problems they caused themselves by being kind of moronic. The bet here is that they will improve on that aspect and stop shooting themselves in the foot every 2 minutes. 

- The cars are loved by their owners, this is self explanatory, a great product will always win and everything will be done to avoid seing it disappear. 

- The new cars will be a massive catalyst up to their launch if you have the patience to hold for at least 1 full year. The R2 will be a best seller and will absolutely destroy the market in which it will be competing. I would 100% buy one if I could. 

- The cars are US made and in this case the US manufactures are not just fighting Tesla they‚Äôre fighting China and a tech US company going bankrupt will not fly with the Trump administration. 

Bearish points will be quick, we all know why it‚Äôs a turd 

- Not being gross margin profitable is a crazy achievement for any kind of respected company,  that‚Äôs some new regarded level of regardness. 

- They could fail on everything they‚Äôre trying to accomplish 

- R2 might just be an other turd machine that doesn‚Äôt fit in any market  

- Elon Musk is literally running the country and has people everywhere, maybe he‚Äôll just want to fuck with Rivian even if it‚Äôs a net negative for the US 


I have more to say but I just gave you bunch of regards way too much to read at once and I don‚Äôt want to fry the 2 remaining brain cells you still have up there.

"Quantum Computing Inc is going to crashContext: Quantum computing is having its moment. It‚Äôs risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

Quantum Computing Inc is junk

Iceberg Research‚Äôs recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that they‚Äôve made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

They lack talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of their employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), they rank incredibly poorly among it‚Äôs peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues they come out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. And this is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of their ‚Äútalent‚Äù comes from the Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company‚Äôs Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company with Quantum Computing Inc. Notably he is both a director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of Cassava Sciences). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang ‚Äî Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven‚Äôs. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company‚Äôs chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English literature at Steven‚Äôs, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven‚Äôs. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven‚Äôs is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees. D-Wave six fold. All have similar market cap. What‚Äôs driving value? We‚Äôve established that it‚Äôs not human capital. Iceberg‚Äôs research reveals it‚Äôs not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well?  Regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of Quantum Computing Inc is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag. In fact no Wall Street analysts track them. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

The 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it‚Äôs junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why they‚Äôve done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

They‚Äôre literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you‚Äôre a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It‚Äôs a regard trap. 

It‚Äôs like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co.

"Where are future returns even supposed to come from? Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a clich√© but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way. ",11-28-2024

"I started this year with $15k, lost it all mid-year during the great bull run, and eventually built it back up to $60k through LEAPS.After depositing $15k, I set a goal to invest in ‚Äòvalue stocks‚Äô and grow my portfolio by 20% annually, managing it myself by picking individual stocks.

I started by buying 10 stocks, including Celsius, Tesla, Arm, Ferrari, and others. My portfolio grew to $18k. From there, it fluctuated, and at the time, I knew nothing about options. Eventually, I decided to throw it all into one name when I saw its price spiking. My account hit $30k for the first time. However, I still hadn‚Äôt learned to take profits and was stuck in a scarcity mindset, feeling like I had to ride every trade ‚Äòto the max.‚Äô ü§¶

After watching my portfolio tank back to $12k, I started revenge trading to recover losses but ended up nearly losing everything. That experience pushed me to learn about options, including the Greeks, implied volatility, and moneyness.

I focused on companies that were ‚Äòpromising‚Äô for the near to long term and had been beaten down. Instead of buying high and selling low, I started buying stocks at cheaper prices and simply waiting.

"$RIVN: Riding to ValhallaAlright, degenerates. Rivian isn‚Äôt just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs the ex-nerd who‚Äôs going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you‚Äôre willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.

## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver

**Tesla‚Äôs Fumbling the Ball** 

Elon‚Äôs gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they‚Äôre turning the corner to RIVN, who‚Äôs out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla‚Äôs stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian‚Äôs already at brunch ordering mimosas.

**How Rivian Could Ride Trump‚Äôs EV Rollercoaster**

You‚Äôd think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here‚Äôs the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù policies. With Rivian‚Äôs production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian‚Äôs set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone‚Äôs FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the market realizes this.

**New Models That‚Äôll Make You Feel Things** 

Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian‚Äôs R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it‚Äôs the hot-but-affordable option that‚Äôs ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger network? That‚Äôs not just sexy‚Äîthat‚Äôs full-blown EV porn. This isn‚Äôt a one-night stand; Rivian‚Äôs building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn‚Äôt inclusive enough for you Wendy‚Äôs employees, they‚Äôre adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).

**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** 

Sure, Rivian‚Äôs been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they‚Äôve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they‚Äôve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That‚Äôs efficiency, baby.

**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**

 Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They‚Äôre hyped about Rivian‚Äôs leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.

RIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they‚Äôre now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company‚Äôs market cap isn‚Äôt going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they‚Äôre only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.

## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)

**Dilution** 

Rivian‚Äôs diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW‚Äôs cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.

**Cash Burn**

Rivian‚Äôs like the guy spending money he doesn‚Äôt have to impress his date. Sure, it‚Äôs a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it‚Äôs a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he‚Äôs going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that‚Äôs all he talks about? Hell no, he‚Äôll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.

## TL;DR: 

RIVN isn‚Äôt just another EV play‚Äîit‚Äôs *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian‚Äôs lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock‚Äôs the real deal, and I‚Äôm strapping in for the ride.

"(50k YOLO) The Walmart Tariff GambitPositions:
80 87.5C 8/15/2025 @ 6.58 avg (~52k)

DD:

TLDR; Walmart is poised to easily gain +20-30% over the next year. In conjunction with incredibly cheap LEAPs (20% IV) this means the potential for two caniac combos worth of tendies. 

The Overview 
Walmart has seen almost a 30% gain since last earnings as investors are piling in on the presumption that increased automation and E-Commerce will improve top and bottom lines. What is less talked about right now is the effect the Trump administration will have on Walmart and its domestic competitors. Walmart sources almost 2/3s of its products domestically in the US. In fact, Walmart has direct relationships with US suppliers and manufacturers‚Äî this has been a core part of their business model in limiting costs (and food prices, as we will get to). Walmarts competitors, however, mostly source abroad: Target for example has almost 49% of its supplying factories based in China alone. Yea, that‚Äôs right‚Äî the same China Trump wants to slap massive import tariffs on. So what happens when Walmarts competitors raise prices? Well, there‚Äôs a couple options (all of which are either favorable or neutral to Walmart). Either A) Competitors raise prices; Walmart does not on its domestic products and they subsequently capture a much larger market share as consumers flock to cheap Walmart name brand goods (tendies) B) Competitors raise prices and Walmart uses it as an excuse to raise prices as well; profit margins go up while market share stays approximately the same (tendies) or C) this analysis is wrong and Walmart is hit just as hard as its competitors; the automation, E-Commerce platforms, and foreign markets Walmart is attempting to get market share in (and the market is obsessed with) continue to bear fruit, and we are left either up or approximately the same (kids meal tendies). This is in conjunction with the fact that Walmart has reported that consumers from all income strata have already begun switching to Walmart items from competitor‚Äôs stores (read, brand loyalty is in the gutter) making any price discrepancies between Walmart and its competitors have a magnified effect on consumer demand. 

Execution:
But why the hell would I yolo in Walmart which might only go up 20-30% if you are right instead of other, juicier stocks that could move more? It‚Äôs because the relative stability of Walmart‚Äôs stock over the past several years works massively in our favor. 7 month ATM LEAPS are priced with 20% IV in mind (+10% break even), or roughly 6.50 per option. You regards spend more time value premium on a Tesla monthly call than a year long Walmart one. This means we can eliminate much of the risk of this DD (timing the market) and exaggerate the gains from that ‚Äúsmall‚Äù 20-30% move. We are talking a 3-4x of your investment from a -mostly- theta safe investment. And remember, that‚Äôs from at the money LEAPS. This is what makes this investment choice such a juicy opportunity for us.",11-18-2024
"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise valueHello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end.¬†I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value.

So here‚Äôs something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right‚Ä¶?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I‚Äôm not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o‚Äô business¬† segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir‚Äôs stock is.

For starters, let‚Äôs take into consideration palantir‚Äôs enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir‚Äôs enterprise value has ballooned much more.

https://preview.redd.it/6povwnwzcn1e1.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=879ebbefc794996c48be08cbb0144c0ee9d675cd

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19*¬†

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this.¬†

But consider this. In their last ‚Äúblowout‚Äù quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate.¬†

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir‚Äôs revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy‚Äôs (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*‚ÄúAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency. You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?‚Äù*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It‚Äôs not just about justifying the current stock price, it‚Äôs about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time.¬†

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It‚Äôs a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*.¬†

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it‚Äôs an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end.¬†

As it stands now, *all* of palantir‚Äôs equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is.¬†

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!*¬†

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that‚Äôs what makes a market.

Happy investing!",11-18-2024

"Trump Team Eyes Rule Overhaul for Self-Driving Regulations, Potential Catalyst to Boost Tesla's Subscription RevenueThe Trump transition team is prioritizing the development of a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles, aiming to revise current regulations that limit the deployment of autonomous cars without human controls. This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla‚Äôs CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.

Current regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.

Musk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump‚Äôs ""Department of Government Efficiency,"" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk‚Äôs announcements.

The push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.

"Those who think removing the EV tax credit will help Tesla are smoking some exotic copium. Here's my crystal ball.1. Trump removes $7,500 EV tax credits and imposes import tariffs on all imported EVs.
2. The US EV manufacturers are starved out, and Tesla is the only surviving US EV maker - I quote ""Tesla does not depend on subsidies"".
3. Tesla increases its US EV market share, seemingly as the only car manufacturer without risk of discontinuity.
4. Nonetheless, Tesla delivery numbers remain stagnant despite increased US market share due to lowering overall EV sales.
5. Tesla now monopolises the US EV market, significantly diluting the need to compete.
6. US import tariffs are now in full effect. Imported parts are too expensive, and cost-cutting is prioritised. Tesla's costly R&D takes a backseat.
7. China, Korea and the Germans retaliate by imposing tariffs on Tesla imports, crippling Tesla's global market EV share.
8. Chinese, Korean and German EV makers continue to improve EV capabilities in a 3-cornered fight, widening the tech gap to Tesla.
9. The difference in EVs has now become more apparent. Tesla now lacks value for money and is no longer relevant to the global market. The US is dethroned as a major EV leader.
10. Tesla now struggles to sustain revenue growth without the global market. It now struggles to justify its colossal trillion-dollar valuation. Tesla needs to milk the already-drying US harder, somehow.
11. A new generation of Tesla bag holders is created.

  
Edit: Hundreds of ya all only read point 7 and started refuting how Tesla has factories in China and Germany, so there aren't tariffs, clear skies, etc. Look, when this trade war starts, these countries will want blood. Tesla is not only the US hallmark of EVs, but its flamboyant boss is now part of the US administration that initiated the sanctions.

"South Korea's ""Value Up"" program, and why Korean stocks will boom over the next decade.Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the ""Korean discount"". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of ""Chaebol""(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs.

The Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value.

Earlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called ""Value Up"", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. **The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock**. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. 

In addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes.

There are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples:

- SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings.

- Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x.

- Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap.

When you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term.

With the US market's P/E ratio hitting record highs despite rising bond yields, the Korean market seems like a really strong opportunity for investors concerned with valuations and looking to diversify

"Will TSLA still skyrocket?I have been reminding people not to chase the rally for the past two days, and I don't think Tesla will see another 10% daily rally next.

Institutions have finished building up their positions over the past two days, and the retail investors who chased the rally are starting to take profits, and those who didn't make any money are stopping their losses and leaving the market. The only people willing to buy at this price level right now are value investors, but they're not going to get out at this price. So Tesla shares will shake out slightly ahead of Q4 earnings, and there will be no more big rallies or declines.

Lastly NVDA will own the entire vertical from Hyperscaler to Retail Individual end user level, why? NVDA has proven that compute, it was never just a smaller and faster cpu, it was all about ACCELERATED compute with gpu architecture to get computation to the next level- why the AI revolution is here. IE Enter NVDA Retail PC / Lap Top Chips coming Latest Sept 2025, with my guess, Jensen starts marketing from first half of 2025, and wider release commercially of NVDA CPU for 1st qtr of 2026, March, me thinks Jensen starts getting market ready all of 2025 for release in the wild September 2025 for retail user and full wider release by March 2026 / end of February 2026. Recap: for regular retail, end user like you and me: the latest we'll have to wait to get our hands on NVDIA designed CPU's for our end user RETAIL level laptops and pc's is Sept 2025. With ALL of 2025 being an advertisement year before the debut. Will we have actual testers with heavy hitter results as soon as first qtr of 2025? Will Jensen decide to release BEFORE Sept 2025?..

 I think all of 2025 NVDA CPU will be marketed to Kingdom come and anticipation brought to the brim, and that will be felt emotionally and in the actual stock price for this freak of nature NVDA CPU chip. Another knock out sucker punch to AMD and INTC QCOM and others. Moving into their end user market as well now. ; ) Recap: For regular end user like you and me CPU: Latest we'll have it physically in our laps in a laptop or on our desktop Sept of 2025. Meaning all of 2025 will be marketed to kingdom come before it's release in Sept 2025. And the full level CPU release by March 2026. So... yeah... AMD and INTEL have a lot to worry about. And as far as I know, Biden or Trump won't block sales of regular computer pc windows chips to China or anywhere else for that matter. :)

Imagine being the king of accelerated compute and now you have a cpu + gpu combo ARM chip that runs silent like Apple M chips and sips low power like such, but games and does AI and any heavy compute intense task very wicked like, very retail level computer chip level like that is specifically from the box ready to work with cuda and marry with existing nvidia gpu's at the hyperscaler level to even more efficiently run AI intense software and on prem (on the laptop or pc itself without cloud compute help, like QCOM snapdragon Elite PC boasts it can do(but sucks, incompatible with lots of software and games, not so with nvda). People will hunt down a windows PC that has both* NVDA* gpu AND CPU* chips. Here is the link for more info=

""Not just that, but NVIDIA is also cooking up its new GeForce RTX 50 series ""Blackwell"" desktop graphics cards, and its new GeForce RTX 50 Laptop series ""Blackwell"" mobile GPUs, which will end up being featured inside of these new AI PCs with an NVIDIA + MediaTek CPU based on the Arm architecture.""

""NVIDIA has also previously said that RTX is the ""Premium"" AI PC platform, and that CPUs and SoCs launching with new NPUs (Neural Processing Units for AI workloads) are for ""Basic"" AI PCs. The company is right, as a decent discrete GeForce RTX GPU can blow away any NPU inside of any CPU now, and for years to come.""

""The new silicon will support advanced technologies, and will be mass-produced on TSMC's new 3nm process node, and will compete against Apple's new M4 chip, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors.""

""NVIDIA is aiming for high-end segment with its first consumer CPU, expected in 2025

""However, you'd think it would lean heavily on Nvidia's graphics technology. Ultimately, you'd expect it to offer the best graphics performance on the market."" DAMN STRAIGHT. 

""The implication** with this new PC chip for 2025 is that it may well (It WILL, no 'may' it will) debut a new* in-house CPU core design from Nvidia. It would certainly be far more interesting if it did. (it will)That would also enable Nvidia to offer something much more performant than Arm's own CPU core designs.""
aaand = 

""And make no mistake, the Arm instruction set allows for some very high performance CPU cores these days. By some measures, Apple's latest CPU cores in the M4 have 60% better IPC (or performance per clock cycle) than anything Intel or AMD currently offer.""

And these cpu chips to come out officially in September 2025, but anouncement dates and getting market ready will start first half of 2025, likely this ER starts talking about it or beginning of next year... Commercial anouncement will be THE FIRST HALF OF 2025 or first qtr of 2025 yr proper... but you never know, Jensen might pull an early bird push this into the EARLY first half of 2025... Very likely Jensen talks about these babies in this coming CC next Friday?, we'll see. But it's happening either way. And market will value and trade NVDA accordingly. Millions of PC's with NVDA CPU's, as far as I can remember Biden cant block normal PC chips for normal computers to China or anywhere else for that matter.

"Hear me out, hear me out (TSLA)So Elmo was on a call today with The Donald and Zelensky. ü•≠ may have been negative in the past about EVs, but Elon has to have a deal in place - most likely to tariff international EVs so that Tesla wins bigly. But, we all know this. Tesla smashed it this week. Am I pissed I missed it? Yes. Am I looking inwards for losing 30% this week, when the market rallied and a young degen chimpanzee could‚Äôve made money? Absolutely. Do I think on Monday I will be buying the Tesla top? Absolutely not. 

I think there is another catalyst for Tesla. Fuck the election, fuck the new administration. That‚Äôs yesterday‚Äôs news. I‚Äôm talking Russia. 

We‚Äôve seen Elon and Putin in headlines recently. Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink over Taiwan as a favor to China. But unlike Sleepy Joe, Trump, a fan of Elon, and seemingly friend of Putin, will not give a shit about this communication. With the prospect of at least a ceasefire, if not all out end, to the war in Ukraine looking likely, I believe this opens up trade with Russia again. But this is where it gets interesting. We have an inside man. Elon is first in the running to reopen business in Russia. He is the business face of this administration, and I believe his targets will be set on the Russian automobile market potential. 

Some stats I have found:
- The Electric Vehicles market in Russia is projected to reach a revenue of US$2,470.0m in 2024.
- The market is expected to experience an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2029) of 18.09%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$5,673.0m by 2029.
- By 2029, it is estimated that unit sales of Electric Vehicles market in Russia will reach 61.94k vehicles.
- In 2024, the volume weighted average price of Electric Vehicles market in Russia is expected to be US$89.9k (Elmo can sell for cheaper)

Feel free to collectively shit all over me in the comments, but can you really say to yourself this is farfetched? I don‚Äôt think so. Elon will do Elon things. This is a PR and economic win for him - be one of the faces associated with ending a war, and be one of the leaders in re-intergating Russia into the global economy.

"70k gain thanks to the Trump Trade no one talked aboutEveryone piling into Tesla, Bitcoin, DJT, etc. and no one ever mentioned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two companies have been orphaned ever since their conservatorship 15+ years ago. During Trump's first presidency he implemented steps to re-privatize the entities and with him back in office the market reacted accordingly. I started building my position in the junior preferreds a little over a year ago.

Should mention that there is still room to run. Most of the junior preferred issues are trading at around 30% of their face value. I only hold the junior preferred shares as the common will most likely get wiped in any recap and release scenario. 

It will be interesting to see who Trump picks as his treasury secretary in the coming weeks. John Paulson is one of the names being floated around - he famously bet against subprime mortgages during the GFC and holds a large amount of Fannie and Freddie junior preferreds.

What I found is that Tesla tends to trade at about 50% above my fair value calculation, but it can become unstable if it goes 60% over. An example of this was just before the Robotaxi event, which was followed by a large drop.



My current fair value estimate for tesla is $170 and at $297.5 it has reached 75% over.

"ASML: Why I am giving up on the stock (for the short term)ASML is a Netherlands based manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company enjoys a wide moat as currently this is only company which can manufacture equipments to produce latest 3 NM AI chips.

ASML counts TSM, Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel and others as its customers.

However, demand for non AI semiconductor equipment systems has dropped significantly which prompted ASML to give lower guidance for the next quarter.

The stock was savagely beateb down and fell from 800+‚Ç¨ to 610‚Ç¨ at yesterday's closing.

Why I have given him on hope of revival of ASML fortunes in the short term?

Except for high end AI chips, rest of the chip industry is struggling to increase sales revenue and profits. In absence of increase in sales, the demand for new non-AI chip producing equipments will be very slow.

Only a sliver of the semi conductor industry [that includes NVDA] has order book full for next rwo quarters. But that demand may also taper in by mid 2025 as likes of Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc have their data centers and LLMs ready by then.

In absense of new demand for non-AI chips and expected slow down in AI chips, it is unlikely any foundary will place new orders for the ASML equipment [each machine is said to cost between 100 M$-300M$].

Revival in the fortunes of ASML depends on breakthrough in new chip designs which will make it neccessary to spend on new equipments. But that breakthrough may take a year or more [yes, it takes time to discover/invent new technologies & designs with sufficient advantage that merits an upgrade].

ASML stock fell below important psychological resistance of 618 ‚Ç¨ yesterday, while US tech sector roared to new heights. This weakness is fortunes of ASML is telling and may lead to further drop in price in coming days.

While ASML remains a strong company with a wide moat, but in the current cycle of the semi conductor industry it is unlikely to post strong results.

How to trade?

Buy 580 ‚Ç¨ PUTs with December 20th expiry.

Happy Trading!

Position: 311 nov 15 $2.50 calls

Lucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.

EDIT: I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING AND HOLDING STOCK NOT OPTIONS. We need more stock holders for the short squeeze front with the low float. Options are at a high premium now after I posted this but the stock is still about the same price.

Feel free to reserve your Lucid Gravity SUV on Nov 7th. That would help tremendously for the stock. Plus 

Edit: MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR STOCKS UNSHORTABLE BY PUTTING THEM ON A HIGH SELL OFFER LIKE $50 OR DISABLING BORROWING.

UPDATE: 
If you bought calls and want to sell them please buy stock. Most of the regards shorted bought stock at $2.20 with 33% shorted. Let's squeeze them out. This stock still has a bunch it can run.",11-05-2024

"Valeo: The Europoor EV Play You're Too Rich to NoticeRead up, I know this is¬†**WallStreet**¬†Bets but while you've been busy losing money on $TSLA calls, there's an actual value play in the europoor EV space that's criminally undervalued: Valeo, the French auto supplier that's about to make your wife's boyfriend jealous.

**TL;DR:**

* Massively undervalued based on fundamentals
* Rising profit margins in coming quarters
* Confirmed strong cash flow
* Already announced debt reduction plan
* Huge R&D investments already made
* Cost reduction strategy in progress
* Short-term üåàüêª manipulating price down based on slight revenue dip and debt.

**üöÄ Short Squeeze Potential**:  
The stock has significant short interest with bears piling in on revenue guidance. But these üåàüêª are about to get caught with their pants down when:

* Margin improvements hit next quarter
* EV transition accelerates
* Cost reduction results start showing
* Debt reduction plan delivers

**Why Your Smooth Brain Should Care:**

1. They're balls deep in EV AND Self-Driving tech when every boomer car manufacturer is trying to catch up to Tesla
2. Stock is getting hammered short term but bottom has been resisting for a while now = perfect entry for patient autists
3. Increasing dividends coming for those who can hold without paper handing

**The Real DD:**  
Short sellers are having a field day with the revenue guidance being slightly down for next year. But here's what these ü§° are missing - Valeo is positioning for the entire auto industry's transition to EV and to add self driving feature. They've already done the hard part with R&D investment while implementing cost-cutting measures. They have a world class AI division (valeo.ai) and provide the best Lidar around.

**Price Action:**  
The stock is getting beaten down harder than your portfolio after a JPow speech. But unlike your options plays, this has actual fundamentals behind it. When the EV transition accelerates, those who diamond handed this will be laughing.

**Position or Ban:**  
Currently holding shares because I actually believe in this play (and I'm too europoor for options).

"Lucid vroom vroomCriticism of Lucid Motors as a company and investment can stem from several factors:

1. **Production Challenges**: Lucid has faced significant delays in ramping up production of its electric vehicles (EVs), which raises concerns about its ability to meet demand and achieve profitability.

2. **High Valuation**: The stock has often been seen as overvalued compared to its revenue and production numbers, leading some investors to view it as a speculative investment rather than a sound long-term pick.

3. **Competition**: The EV market is rapidly growing, with established automakers and new entrants competing fiercely. Lucid faces stiff competition from companies like Tesla, Rivian, and traditional automakers that are expanding their EV offerings.

4. **Financial Stability**: Concerns about cash flow and the company's ability to finance its operations and growth plans can deter investors. If the company struggles to sell vehicles or generate revenue, that could negatively impact its stock performance.

5. **Market Sentiment**: Stock performance can be influenced by broader market trends. If investor sentiment towards EVs or growth stocks shifts, Lucid's stock could be adversely affected.

6. **Management Decisions**: Any perceived mismanagement or lack of strategic vision can lead to a loss of investor confidence. 

Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

BYD Auto (Chinese) revenue eclipses Tesla for first time as EV giants go head to head,10-30-2024
"$F Freaky? Future? Ford.Are you kidding me? Overnight dump and the thing only moves down a dollar? A 2-cent BEAT on EPS and a 10th consecutive revenue beat? Like 250 MILLION SHARES in VOLUME over the last TWO days? Please, this thing is primed for takeoff as soon as the covered call bitches are done.

A few key points:

-First off, and most importantly, Ford is becoming a software company. They have over 12000 software engineers. The potential profit from commercial and governmental fleet management is sky high. They already have 630,000 subscribers at an average of $7-8 dollars a month. That's 60 million dollars a year for just software already, and they're only scratching the surface. And what happens when we need a more popular brand than Tesla for LIDAR and optical mapping for all the self-driving cars and robots working in public? What happens when all service vehicles are ALREADY Fords? No other brand will have the tech or reach, or relationship with the US govt. and companies.

-Ford is SELLING their cars, often even with their own financing (by the way Ford Credit is making BANK). Their leases are so low they don't even bother discussing them, and that is key considering their competition will have lots full of old inventory piling up. Look at their Maverick sales. Look at their LINCOLN sales up 50% YoY. The Nautilus is by far the most well received SUV we've seen all year.

-Ford is expanding remote and mobile service; yet another profit/revenue stream.

-Ford's EVs are only getting better. Have yall seen the Mach E Rally? Thing is a beast and looks good too. The 2025 Mach E will have all US parts and should have an under 30k price tag with the government incentive, making it competitive with even chinese EV pricing IN CHINA. Ford is already shipping Tesla supercharger adapters for their chargers, and collaboration with Tesla should only grow deeper as both companies realize they need eachother for the overall future of US excellence and dominance in the automotive industry.

-The ex-dividend date is coming up on November 7th, and I see 0 chance, as in ain't no way, this thing is going lower. Who wouldn't want 15 cents a share on a stock trading under 11 dollars for the last time in history?

-CEO Jim Farley is late comedian star Chris Farley's cousin, so the boomers, Gen X, and millenials all know what the fuck is up.

TL;DR: This is not just a car company, it's a TECH company. I bought more shares and long dated calls today because FUCK WHOEVER IS SELLING. Honestly, I might get even more tomorrow morning and EAT on that dividend AND profits for the next 20 YEARS as it becomes the best selling brand in the US and worldwide. THIS IS AMERICA MOTHERFUCKER! BUILT FORD TOUGH.

"When Skynet Takes Over, I Want a Piece of the Action ($100K Investment Thesis)[Positions as of 10\/28\/2024](https://preview.redd.it/rztd2a5l6lxd1.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8fa595bef1b6cb133af2398456283122db2f8c3)

TL;DR: We're entering an unprecedented technological acceleration where AI capabilities are advancing exponentially. Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.

**The Thesis:**

We are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:

**Key Technical Developments:**

* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints
* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities
* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)
* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)

Business Implications:

1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.
2. Follow the Money:
   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually
   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today‚Äôs dollars
   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets
   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment
3. The Economics Are Compelling:
   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue
   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt
   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)

  
**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:

[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)

* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:

[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)

   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% 
   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% 
   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%
   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% 
   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% 
* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:

https://preview.redd.it/u14rf0vi7lxd1.jpg?width=1126&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de34b7cdd3d81b7e017b0a06eed7a6102f8c2ddf

   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA
   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR
   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:
      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters
* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):
   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout
   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.

  


 **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**

There's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\[1\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\[2\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   
I've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. ",10-29-2024

"TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worthElon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.

On Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.

Much of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.

He predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from ‚Äúfully unsupervised‚Äù Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.

In an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, ‚ÄúI predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.‚Äù

Musk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).

Tesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.

The second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.

* They are currently working with $LLY on 3D bio-printing organs in space, which they‚Äôre making great progress of.
* They acquired Hera systems to increase the dominance for national security space customers.
* They were selected to provide advanced RF payloads to a leading defense contractor.
* They have joined the US-U.A.E council where Danny Sebright stated ‚ÄúRedwire‚Äôs pioneering advancements in Space Infrastructure showcase the very best of American innovation and ingenuity. As a member Redwire joins an elite list of member companies at the forefront of almost every industry.
* They signed a MOU with NASA‚Äôs REMIS-2 mission to provide Spaceflight hardware, ground hardware and software, engineering services, payload facility integration and more.
* Selected to provide a critical onboard computer system for the European Space Agency Hera Mission, Europes flagship planetary defense mission.
* To supply Solar Arrays for Thales Alenia Telecommunications product line.
* Selected by (SCA) to develop, build and deliver advanced thruster technology nicknamed the (Valkyrie Thurster) designed for reliable, high-volume production for the surge in national security space programmes.
* Awarded Darpa Prime Contract to be the prime mission integrator for the development of revolutionary air-breathing satellite that will demonstrate the use of Novel electric propulsion in very-low earth orbit (VLEO).
* Awarded Contract by the European Space agency to develop a Robotic Arm to support the landing for the International Lunar Exploration Mission.
* Selected by Rocketlab to provide Antennas and RF hardware.

And those are just some of the latest contracts & advancements Redwire has made. They‚Äôve been prolific aquirers since going public and continue to aggressively expand their footprint across all space sectors.

It‚Äôs why their CEO goes by the Moto of ‚ÄúIf space wins Redwire wins‚Äù, a confident statement backed by their foundational success of becoming the ‚Äúbuilding blocks to space‚Äù

Yet it‚Äôs currently one of the cheapest and most undervalued Space stocks there is. Trading at a P/S of just 1.58 compared to Rocket Labs 11.5. A market cap of just $450m vs Rocketlabs $4.28b & ASTS $6.73b

This isn‚Äôt about who‚Äôs better, it‚Äôs about Redwire being drastically undervalued and under the radar of most growth investors.

I shared my thoughts on Rocketlab 3-4 months ago after scooping the October and January calls.

Since then people have finally started to realise the potential in the company. To sit are similar valuations based upon growth and income, Redwire would not to hit approximately $42/share. At this point it would still remain once of the cheapest yet most advanced space companies out there.

Why now?

Stocks move in themes, every success trader from here to Timbuktu will tell you that. It‚Äôs caused by the excitement and willingness of investors to take on risk on what they believe to be innovative and early stage Giants. The recent news of SpaceX, the parabolic run in ASTS and Rocketlabs 50th successful launch, all set the stage for a new theme and fomo rally to emerge.

Just like when EVs moved thanks to the hype in Tesla we saw the entire sector move.

Just like when $AI started the AI run and others such as NVDA (plus plenty of others) took the button and ran for 12-18 months.

I see the Space sector as an emerging theme and names such as Redwire could potentially take the baton and garner worldwide interest.

For me, I see the worst case, bear case, as Redwire being a $1bn+ market cap by Christmas, which still represents a 100% move. Best case I see buyers stepping into calls of which market makers are drastically under-positioned for, creating a substantial over the top rally.

"$TSLA: The DD of a lifetime. Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let‚Äôs crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn‚Äôt even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla‚Äôs Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn‚Äôt tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he‚Äôs in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That‚Äôs triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn‚Äôt, and he‚Äôs letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I‚Äôm betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you.

Biggest EV car market in China, people there have options but there are so many random ass Chinese EV models doesn't compare to Tesla imo. Eventually Tesla tech value will outshine all those other EV brands when regulators approves FSD in china. 

Just with the tech it's head and shoulder above anything i.e. Rivian was cool but boring now compared to FSD, autonomy, etc.

With used EV car prices declining from YoY, that's a good thing cuz more people will buy EVs which will use the Tesla charging networks, additional revenue for Tesla.

"üöÄ ACHR: The Future of Urban Air Mobility & Why It‚Äôs Leading the Charge üöÄ**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is developing electric flying taxis (eVTOLs) with solid partnerships, including the U.S. Air Force, and aiming for a slice of a $1.5 trillion market by 2040. Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited about their tech and the company‚Äôs future.

**1. Game-Changing Tech & Some Pretty Sweet Deals**  
Alright, imagine this: you‚Äôre sick of sitting in traffic, and instead, you hop into a quiet, eco-friendly flying taxi. That‚Äôs what Archer is building, and it‚Äôs not just a pipe dream‚Äîthey‚Äôve got **$142 million in contracts** from the U.S. Air Force. Yeah, the **Air Force** wants their tech. Plus, they‚Äôre expanding to places like the UAE and India. Big markets, big moves.

**U.S. Air Force & ACHR. Yeah, it‚Äôs serious.**

*Processing img qp6pziu3livd1...*

**2. eVTOLs: A Market Ready to Take Off üöÅüí∏**

* This isn‚Äôt just a small niche. We‚Äôre talking **$1.5 trillion** by 2040. That‚Äôs the kind of market size that gets me excited. ACHR is already in the lead, planning to have their flying taxis ready by 2025.
* And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîcities are desperate for greener, faster transport solutions. Archer could be the Tesla of the skies.

**3. Market Skepticism Presents Opportunities**

* Some investors might be underestimating ACHR‚Äôs potential. Short interest is high, which could indicate that there‚Äôs skepticism. But strong partnerships, like the one with the U.S. Air Force, are clear votes of confidence in the technology.
* This is a chance to get in early, while the market is still waking up to ACHR‚Äôs potential. üöÄ

**Check This Out: ACHR vs. Early Tesla**

*Processing img q9fok5c7livd1...*

**4. How ACHR Stacks Up Against Competitors**  
ACHR isn‚Äôt just sitting around‚Äîcompared to other eVTOL companies, they‚Äôre in a solid spot. More contracts, big market potential, and a growing presence.

*Processing img pvzfzv2blivd1...*

**5. Why Now is a Great Time to Watch ACHR**

* **Strategic Growth:** ACHR is actively securing partnerships and expanding its market reach. With contracts like the one with the U.S. Air Force, they‚Äôre proving their tech isn‚Äôt just a concept‚Äîit‚Äôs real, and it‚Äôs happening.
* **Upcoming Developments:** Keep an eye on earnings reports, potential new contracts, and advancements in eVTOL testing. Each of these could be a major catalyst that puts ACHR in the spotlight.
* **Positioning Early:** The eVTOL market is projected to grow massively, and ACHR is positioning itself to lead. Getting in early with innovative companies like this has historically been a winning strategy.

  
**Think of it like this: you‚Äôre getting a ticket to the future of transportation, with a company that‚Äôs already making serious moves.** üöÅ

Tesla Cybertruck Gets Massive Price Cut For Both AWD And Cyberbeast,10-19-2024
"Most nuclear stocks will go the way of EV stocksBack in 2020/2021 tons of new EV companies were being taken public with the promise of becoming the next Tesla. After all, how hard is it to produce EVs profitably? Get a car frame, slap on a battery, program a UI, and you're good to go, right? Wrong. Pretty much every EV stock other than Tesla has shit the bed. They all discovered that manufacturing is hard and lost tons of money in the process. It turns out that it took more than a pile of cash and some promises of greatness to create a profitable EV company. 

Fast forward to today and we have the same thing happening with nuclear stocks, specifically with ones promising to design and build nuclear reactors. OKLO has about $250m in cash with no proven reactors or revenue for years to come, yet it trades at a $2.2B market cap. NNE has about $30m in cash with lots of promises and no revenue for years to come and trades at a $600m market cap. NNE is also being sued for lying in their IPO documents and misrepresenting what they're capable of. How many people here truly understand what it takes to build and run a nuclear plant safely? None, and yet tons are willing to ""invest"" in these companies. Some of you ""long-term investors"" are going to be taken for a ride with some of these companies at these valuations. A ride straight down. Good luck and remember to post your loses, and for people who actually know valuable information about nuclear stuff, please do share.",10-19-2024
"Expectations for Tesla earnings and Elmo after the robotaxi event? Some of the news I've seen so far has been negative: the company missing production target, horrors of cybertruck, increasing competition outside states due to cheaper Chinese cars, the recent disappointing cybercab event, and now FSD being investigated for killing pedestrians. The only bullish thing I saw were the increasing sales in China. What are you thinking for the upcoming earnings and why? ",10-18-2024
"$MBLY - FreebieNobody wants to buy stocks that are down ~70% YTD. Everyone wants $DRUG, $MSTR & soon any miners after they explode. It‚Äôs strange how the mind works. FOMO. 

Everyone piles in because Bitcoin is now going to the moon! /s

Anyway.

Earlier this year $TSLA was going to rock everyone‚Äôs world with the highly anticipated Robotaxi reveal. We see how that went. The event seemed rushed and many important details that investors and Tesla enthusiasts wanted were kept quiet.

Well guess what. The future is still very bright for FSD, ADAS, whatever the fuck you wanna call it. Cars that drive themself.

So,

Mobileye is down 70% this year. Why? Because they‚Äôre headquarters are in Israel for starters. Secondly, they reduced forward guidance on their last quarterly earnings due to the shit show going on in China.

What has happened since then?

Iran and Israel are still in their little weiner match.

China has been throwing out money left and right via stimulus.

31% of Mobileye‚Äôs revenue comes from China. Dont you think they should see some relief from the stimulus as Baba, JD, NIO, and every other Chinese stock did?

Why hasn‚Äôt Intel sold any shares even though the were in trouble earlier this year?

"$OKLOYOLO OKLO üöÄ - Why This Stock is Ready to Melt Faces ‚ò¢Ô∏èüåã

Hey all you smooth-brained degenerates, today I'm going deep on a play I think is WAY undervalued and primed to skyrocket: OKLO Inc. ($OKLO). While everyone‚Äôs busy chasing the next meme stock, nuclear power is creeping up as the dark horse to solve our global energy crisis. And Oklo‚Äôs got what it takes to win big in this game.

Why am I so hyped? Because this is the type of stock where if you‚Äôre patient, you could see some major gains as the world shifts toward cleaner, reliable energy. But don‚Äôt just take my word for it‚Äîlet's break down the reasons why Oklo's got serious potential to crush it in the near future. üëá

1. SMRs Are the Future, and Oklo is Positioned to DOMINATE üî•
Everyone‚Äôs talking about solar and wind, but you can‚Äôt scale them fast enough to solve the global power demand, especially in industrialized nations. Nuclear is the only reliable, scalable, carbon-free solution, and small modular reactors (SMRs) are the new frontier. SMRs are safer, faster to deploy, and cheaper to build than traditional large nuclear plants. Oklo is one of the few companies with a fully developed SMR technology that‚Äôs actually on the path to commercialization.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: Oklo isn‚Äôt just developing any run-of-the-mill reactor; they‚Äôve got a next-gen fast reactor that reuses spent nuclear fuel. That‚Äôs right‚ÄîOklo‚Äôs reactors can use waste from other nuclear plants as fuel, which is a HUGE game-changer. They‚Äôre turning a major industry problem into an opportunity, which puts them ahead of other nuclear startups.

2. Regulatory Momentum is On Their Side üìà
Oklo is one of the first companies to receive key licensing approvals from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). They already submitted their first license application back in 2020, and while regulatory hurdles in nuclear are notorious, Oklo‚Äôs head start is critical. The NRC approval process is slow as hell, but Oklo has been grinding it out for years, positioning them to be among the first to bring their product to market once the green light comes. This is first-mover advantage in a sector with MASSIVE growth potential. üí•

And in case you haven‚Äôt been paying attention, governments around the world are finally warming up to nuclear again as they realize you can‚Äôt meet climate goals with renewables alone. Expect to see a TON of government incentives and contracts flowing into this space in the coming years, and Oklo‚Äôs already at the table. üîë

3. Strategic Partnerships & Funding üí∞
A startup can have the best tech in the world, but if they can‚Äôt fund it, they‚Äôre going nowhere. Oklo is already locking down some serious partnerships and investments. They‚Äôve recently secured funding from Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator. Altman‚Äôs investment in Oklo isn‚Äôt just pocket change; it‚Äôs a signal that serious smart money sees the potential here.

Plus, Oklo has partnered with Idaho National Laboratory to utilize their test facilities and advance their reactor designs. They‚Äôve also struck deals with the U.S. Department of Energy to build their first plants on federal land‚Äîwhich is basically like having Uncle Sam as a partner.

4. The TAM is Staggering üöÄ
Global demand for small modular reactors is projected to explode over the next decade. The market size for SMRs could grow to $100 billion by 2030, and Oklo is in prime position to capture a significant chunk of that. Why? Because they‚Äôre not just a concept company anymore‚Äîthey have actual tech and are ahead of most of their competition. As countries look for energy solutions that are green, reliable, and scalable, Oklo is sitting in a sweet spot to capture both government and private sector demand.

5. Insane Upside Potential - This Stock Could Be a Rocket üöÄ
We‚Äôre still early in Oklo‚Äôs journey. The stock is flying under the radar because people are either too scared of nuclear or don‚Äôt realize how game-changing SMRs can be. As more people get clued in to the nuclear renaissance and Oklo moves closer to deploying its reactors, the upside potential is MASSIVE.

Remember when Tesla was trading at a couple hundred bucks and everyone laughed at it? Nuclear is at the same tipping point. As Oklo continues to develop its reactors and builds partnerships, I expect this stock to go sky-high. I‚Äôm thinking $OKLO could be a 10x from here in the long term as they move from concept to deployment.

The Risks (Because I‚Äôm not a total ape) üß†
Regulatory Delays: NRC approvals are slow. Any major roadblocks could push out timelines.
Funding Needs: Oklo will need more capital to scale production, which could lead to dilution if not managed right.
Public Perception of Nuclear: Even though the tech is safe, people are still scared of the word ‚Äúnuclear.‚Äù
TL;DR
Oklo is the dark horse in the clean energy race. They‚Äôve got cutting-edge tech, are ahead of the pack in regulatory approval, and are ready to capture a slice of the $100 billion SMR market. With strategic partnerships, a strong funding base, and growing global demand for sustainable energy, $OKLO is sitting in prime position for a big move.

"IonQ will experience a massive rally and has multiple catalysts on the horizon.**TLDR**; I‚Äôm done doing my due dilligence on IonQ and hold LEAPS that I bought a few months ago during the lows. The price has gone up by 40% since then, and I think this is only the beginning. I expect to see an ASTS-like move within a few weeks to six months for this stock. There are multiple catalysts, primarily technological, as the company produces quantum computing hardware. The technology faces skepticism. I'm not even discussing the SI as I don't care; I‚Äôm focused on the fundamental thesis of IonQ being able to commercialize this technology the fastest, and with superior tech. IonQ has doubled their revenues every year since inception in '21. Went public via SPAC, and is being discounted by Wall Street.

**TL;DR of TL;DR:** $IONQ ATM LEAPS. The company will hold an earnings call next month. Sales are increasing, and they will share their first quantum application. The CEO is good at hyping things in the media and appears to be a great salesman who knows a thing or two about software.

**Why I Think IonQ is Worth a Gamble**

The last time I posted was on September 29th, when IonQ's price was at $8. Since then, the price has increased by 30% to $10.50 today. Some might say, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you share this before it went up?‚Äù Well, I‚Äôll be hearing that every month from now on.

To clarify, my previous post wasn‚Äôt sponsored by IonQ, although I wish it had been. I‚Äôve done my due diligence and am just waiting for the share price to appreciate as we head into 2025.

Quick points on competitive edge: The company has a substantial number of patents stacked up. If you Google a picture of their office, you‚Äôll see a wall full of patents. There‚Äôs significant revenue potential by building a strong base now. IonQ is currently commercializing its technology and claims to have built out a factory that produces these computers in an assembly line manner.

There are multiple short-term use cases for quantum computing. Contrary to popular belief that quantum will only be ""better"" than conventional computing in 20 years, we already see practical applications today. For example, quantum technology is already impacting cryptography.

**Cryptography:** Organizations like the NSA, NIST, and the EU are urging others to transition to post-quantum encryption. Quantum computers can compromise data security across tablets, phones, servers, protocols, and more. The estimated cost of data protection is about 5% of the total value, and the total amount of data doubles every year. While quantum can exploit these vulnerabilities, it can also secure them.

Another critical point is **energy savings** for AI and computing. Forbes recently published an article on how quantum technology could address the energy demand issue for AI, which I found insightful.

My research was primarily from watching company presentations at the Quantum World Congress, earnings calls, and various interviews. Peter Chapman, the CEO of IonQ, previously led the creation of Amazon's 2-day shipping and has been actively discussing quantum machine learning and its applications. He‚Äôs been kind off hyping it up, which is great for the stock. Despite what some skeptics say, this is not all hype, quantum technology is real and is being commercialized now.

I‚Äôd love to dive into more detailed arguments, but that would be a long and potentially boring read. Instead, I recommend checking posts about $IONQ on X from about six months ago, when most of the research began circulating online.

From a technical perspective, I can say that the TTM indicator looks bullish on the 6-day and 8-day charts, showing red dots that signal incoming momentum. The stock had been in a downtrend for a year but has now climbed back to its IPO price.

I‚Äôm sharing this because I‚Äôm done accumulating. My current positions are January 2026 $10 and $15 LEAPS, both bought below 40 deltas and now at 70 for the $10 options and 45 for the $15. I don‚Äôt see the point in risking short-term options, as it would likely lead to wealth destruction. Shares seem like a safer bet for those looking to invest.

Quantum stocks have faced ridicule, being labeled as scams by academics and former insiders who now make a living from YouTube videos and blogs. But to me, this skepticism is reminiscent of people in the 90s saying the internet wouldn‚Äôt take off. From all the quantum stocks I only long IonQ, and avoid the rest.

**Short-term (< 6 months) catalysts:**

* **November 11th Earnings Call:** Expected announcement of the first quantum application running on IonQ's new hardware, which the CEO claims could generate billions in revenue on its own. Still to be proven.
* **Launch of Forte Enterprise:** A data center-ready quantum computer that doesn‚Äôt require ultra-low temperatures. This means it can be placed alongside regular servers without needing a giant freezer for cooling.
* **December 5th, Quantum Basel:** Their European partner will be launching its most powerful system in Switzerland.
* **2025 ‚Äì The Year of Quantum:** The UN, along with smaller partners, will promote quantum computing through media initiatives, highlighting its alignment with sustainable and humanitarian goals. I expect the media narrative to shift from AI to quantum computing, as news outlets look for fresh topics.
* **Prototype Quantum AI Chip:** This development aims to reduce energy consumption, making it more efficient. I remember ARM‚Äôs stock surge when they announced plans for their AI chips, driven by similar excitement.

That‚Äôs it for now. I‚Äôm planning to hold onto my LEAPS until they reach a delta of 1, then switch to shares and ride this investment into 2030, when workloads are expected to shift to NVIDIA GPUs and quantum computing to tackle problems beyond the capabilities of conventional systems, and companies like Oracle, Google, and Tesla are showing interest in this technology.

I know I may sound a bit crazy, but in a few months, I believe I‚Äôll see large returns. It‚Äôs all part of being early, and I enjoy sharing the information I‚Äôve gathered over the past few months.

Musk has been playing this song ‚ÄúRobotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming‚Ä¶‚Äù  for nearly a decade promising 'next year, next year'. And, each time, media, dumb analysts and his fans gather to his next concert just as charmed as previous time, only to be disappointed again!

In April, when $TSLA was around $150-$160, Musk announced the Aug. 8 unveiling day of its robotaxi, Again, the hype starts building, analysts start coming up with crazy numbers and stock starts going up, then around last week of July when TSLA rose to around $260, and knowing that there is no robotaxi, Musk panicked and again changed the date to Oct 10. Stock tanks down to about $190 in August and then as Oct 10 approaches, same hype machine starts working, propelling stock to $260 by Oct 1. Finally, Oct 10 came and Elon finally sang the song again ‚ÄúRobotaxis are coming, Robotaxis are coming in 2026, Robotaxis are coming certainly before 2027‚Äù. And, he showed a 2-seater toy car as future robotaxi! Only, 2% cars sold in US are 2-seaters!! Finally, some analysts are calling the bluff, with Adam Jonas writing ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it‚Äù? 

I wonder why people have been believing this BS for years and spiking TSLA stock each time, when all experts have said that all TSLA has is level 2 driver assistance system, but not FSD as Tesla blatantly continue to lie. You need a combination of LIDAR, Cameras and radars to have level 4 or level 5, fully self driving system while Tesla uses only cameras.

"GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. 


Right now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. 


Google is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. 


You must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? 


The reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. 

Google had something called ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS.""  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. 

AI research and development was a part of it.

In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.

DeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.


The Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).


Now going back to ""PROJECT MOONSHOTS"" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  ""Project Moonshots"" into ""X COMPANY"".

Yes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. 

This is what X Company does -

X's mission is to invent and launch ""moonshot"" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.

 A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. 

Work at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and ""Captain of Moonshots"".

The lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.


SELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. 

They are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).


While Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. 


. . . . . . .


TLDR;

GOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE.

EDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup 


If (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. 

IMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.


Even this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it.

TESLA VS WAYMO : KEY DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND APPROACH 



.
.

1. Sensing the World:

 -  - Waymo's Multi-Sensor Fusion:  Waymo uses a suite of sensors that work together. This is like having multiple senses.


I. Lidar:  Acts like super-precise radar, creating a 3D ""point cloud"" of the surroundings. This excels in low-light and complex environments.

II. Radar: Detects objects and their speed, even in rain or fog.
   

III. Cameras: Provide visual information for recognizing objects like traffic lights and pedestrians.




- - Tesla's Vision-Only System: Tesla relies heavily on cameras, believing that they can provide enough data for AI to understand the world like humans do.


I. Neural Networks:  Tesla uses powerful AI to process the visual data from cameras.


II. No Lidar:  Tesla famously excludes lidar, arguing it's expensive and unnecessary.


- Why this matters:  Lidar provides highly accurate depth and distance data, which is crucial for navigating complex situations. Tesla's vision-only approach is more ambitious but may struggle in conditions where cameras are less effective (e.g., heavy rain, fog).



.
.


2. Understanding the Environment:

I. Waymo's HD Maps: Waymo creates incredibly detailed 3D maps of the areas where its vehicles operate. These maps include road geometry, lane markings, traffic signs, and even the positions of trees and buildings.


II.  Localization: This allows Waymo's cars to precisely locate themselves within the map, even in challenging conditions.


III. Predictability:  Maps help anticipate what's coming and plan routes accordingly.


IV.  Tesla's Real-Time Learning: Tesla relies less on pre-mapped environments. Its AI learns to interpret the world in real-time, based on the data it gathers from its cameras.


V. Generalization: The goal is to create a system that can drive anywhere, not just in pre-mapped areas.


VI. Adaptability: Tesla's system can potentially adapt to new environments and situations more quickly.



- - Why this matters: Waymo's HD maps provide a high level of certainty in known areas, but mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Tesla's approach is more scalable but relies heavily on the AI's ability to correctly interpret complex scenes.



.
.
.

3. Deployment Strategies:

I. Waymo's Gradual Rollout: Waymo has focused on deploying its robotaxi service in specific cities, starting with Phoenix. This allows for careful testing and refinement in controlled environments.


II.  Safety First:  Waymo prioritizes safety and has a strong track record.

III.  Controlled Expansion:  They expand their service area gradually as they gain confidence in their technology.



 IV.  Tesla's Beta Testing: Tesla has released its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to a wider group of drivers. This allows them to gather vast amounts of real-world driving data.


V.  Rapid Iteration:  Tesla can quickly improve its system through frequent software updates.


 VI. Driver Responsibility:  FSD is still a driver-assist system, and drivers are expected to remain vigilant and take over when necessary.


- -  Why this matters: Waymo's approach is more cautious, prioritizing safety and controlled testing. Tesla's approach is faster and more agile, but it also carries more risk, as evidenced by accidents involving FSD.



These are some of the core differences between Waymo and Tesla's approach to self-driving. Both companies are pushing the boundaries of technology, but their philosophies and strategies are quite distinct. It will be fascinating to see how these approaches evolve in the years to come.



. . . . . .  . 


EDIT:  THE MUSK PARADOX 


The entire Tesla brand is highly dependent on Elon. Essentially Elon is Tesla. A lot of the Tesla Brand value is tied up with Elon Musk the human.

This wasn't a problem in the past when Elon seemed like a nerd who just loved tech and posted memes.

Fast forward to 2024, the guy is full blow republican (not saying it's bad or good). He is actively involved with politics.

IMO, He's too busy ""owning the libs"" and fighting cultural wars (""woke virus""). 

Now combine this with his other behavioral problems like self administration of ketamine and using other drugs, and we have a recipe for disaster.


FYI, I'm not an Elon Hater. I used to admire him and it's sad to watch his downfall.


. . . . .


. . . . .

TLDR;


IMO, the event was Very Disappointing. 

Elon announced (NOT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED) basically what he has been promising for years (TRUE AUTONOMY AKA FSD).

It was no different than the previous announcements of FSD and Cybertruk.

I expect delays (regulatory approvals and the actual tech being ready).


. . . . .



. . . . . 


UPDATE :

. . . . . 

For all the regards who don't understand what WAYMO actually is, I just did another post analyzing Google (the owner of Waymo) and why they're the number 1 player in AI, robotics and self driving.

"Does anyone have some thoughts on graphite mining? Could use some extra insights into it! My father in law just recently purchased a 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning and traded in his old F-150 to get it. He literally loved that thing so much so I was actually shocked that he got rid of it and for an electric version of it too‚Ä¶ He said he wanted to do his ‚Äúpart‚Äù in trying to be energy efficient but didn‚Äôt want to give up being a truck owner. He was showing me how and where he charges it (I had to listen to his ramble unfortunately) He was telling me all about the battery that it uses and what it‚Äôs made out of etc. It really got me thinking tbh like if him of all people are buying electric cars/trucks then the boom of electric cars has to be coming soon‚Ä¶ I felt like I was a little late on the Tesla train so I thought maybe I could get in on the tech side so I decided on looking into the batteries that the man was raving about LOL.

Turns out they‚Äôre made out of graphite so my search for a graphite company started lol. I couldn‚Äôt find much when looking in the US on graphite mining. I did find Graphite One who operate a graphite mine out in Alaska. Their mission is to make a graphite supply chain that isn‚Äôt reliant on any other country and is 100% made in the US. I did some digging (figuratively not literally lol) and found that they had just produced samples not more than a couple weeks ago which I thought was perfect timing haha. Seems like they produced a sample for a fast-charging artificial graphite anode material sample, which is super important for fast-charge performance in EVs (my father in law I‚Äôm sure would love to know about that lol). It seems like these results were promising but I‚Äôm no graphite expert so if I link the results down low could someone decipher them for me LOL?

I really like the looks of Graphite One mainly because of what they‚Äôre trying to do but also because I think the demand of electric cars is going to skyrocket in the coming years. If they manage to pull this off and end up supplying most of the graphite in the US they could be huge. Would love hear some other opinions on them and maybe even graphite and the US in general. How are we feeling about the future of electric cars?? Have a good one everyone!

"$DFLI PR. Dragonfly Energy Exploits Significant Revenue Generating Niche In Lithium-Ion Energy Markets 

The EV sector is here to stay. More accurately, its staggering growth is the precursor to much more to come. With that comes investment opportunities. And a significant one is in play for those looking beyond the surging demand in the general vehicle space. In other words, finding companies working to¬†*NOT*¬†directly compete with Tesla

**TSLA-3.24%+**, Ford **F-2.79%+**, General Motors **GM-2.32%+**, and a growing number of smaller manufacturers, could be the right way to allocate investment dollars. Focused on developing and selling its lithium-ion energy sources to significant markets outside of those behemoth's interests, Dragonfly Energy **DFLI+4.10%+** makes that list.

And they are not newcomers trying to find footing. They already have it. Dragonfly is over a decade old, initially founded as a developer of intellectual property focused on Lithium-ion cell manufacturing. They've grown considerably since, revolutionizing the industry by making lithium-ion batteries more accessible for RVers while facilitating an entirely off-grid experience for RV consumers. That differentiation continues to pay growth dividends, with DFLI consistently increasing its market share and sales within the RV, marine, and off-grid solar sectors. Sales in 2022 reached $86 million. More than a sizable total for a smallcap, it represented its fifth consecutive year of revenue growth, an impressive stat since DFLI only started shipping products in 2017.

That streak is expected to continue; DFLI even guided that way. And as a more comprehensive lithium-ion battery technology company today than ever, growth is likely well beyond the forecast period. Considering that operations expanded to developing cell manufacturing processes, designing and assembling battery packs, integrating these packs and other innovative ancillary components into complete energy storage systems, and marketing and sales of these systems into diverse consumer and industrial market channels, it's more than likely; it's probable.

**Better Energy Sources Disrupt Traditional Markets**

Disruptive technology tends to have that effect, and Dragonfly has it, changing the traditional approach of powering RV, marine, and off-grid markets that have relied on lead-acid batteries. Remember, lead is toxic and remains a significant problem for the environment. As a result, demonstrated by its revenue growth, the target markets have been quite receptive to Dragonfly's technology. They should be. It supports a global effort and mission to convert to green, renewable energy. Moreover, unlike competing lead-acid alternatives, Dragonfly and Battle Born batteries are environmentally safer, provide 2-3 times more power, last over ten times longer, are one-fifth the weight, charge faster and require no maintenance. That's game-changing.

To get them into customers' hands, DFLI sells its deep-cycle lithium-ion batteries under two brands. The first is its Dragonfly Energy brand, which serves its Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) customers and partners, including the industry-leading THOR family of recreational vehicles. The second is its direct-to-consumer retail brand, 'Battle Born Batteries,' named after the battle-born state of Nevada, where Dragonfly is headquartered. Beyond the revenue contributions from its branded batteries, income is generated from being designers and resellers of accessories, a defining factor making DFLI a total system integrator for its customers, a value strengthened after acquiring Wakespeed Offshore in 2022.

That deal facilitated Dragonfly to better integrate its storage systems with vehicle engines and alternators. Combined with battery pack monitoring and communication innovations, it sets the 2023 stage for DFLI to capitalize on opportunities presented by larger stationary storage applications. They've earned that position.

Today, Dragonfly is recognized as an expert in lithium-ion batteries and entire lithium battery storage systems. That results from having a robust patent portfolio continually strengthened by innovation, including Dragonfly's dry powder coating cell manufacturing technology and non-flammable battery technology. Production of the cell pilot line for that technology is in progress, with plans to monetize cell manufacturing in the United States next year.

**Stage Set For 2H/2023 Growth**

All told, revenue contributions from its segments are expected to deliver significant YoY growth. The guidance calls for Q1/2023 revenue to range between $17.0 - $19.0 million. Lower overhead is expected to increase margins, though not appreciably. However, revenues and margin curves are expected to steepen as the year goes on, benefiting from the market strength inherent to its OEM business. That's led to DFLI, despite challenging but moderating headwinds, to forecast net sales between $112 to $122 million, or 36% year-over-year growth at the mid-point of the range.

Most important, and the reason for investors to pay attention to the DFLI value proposition at current levels, is that DFLI expects to return to being net income positive in the second half of the year. Thus, recent share price weakness exposes a disconnect between value and expectations. Knowing that savvy traders invest with a forward-looking perspective, it's a window that could close sooner than later. And by ending last year with $17.8 million in cash and access to a $150 million equity line of credit, providing reasons that justify closing that gap may very well be in the news queue. Trading ahead of that likelihood may therefore be a wise and timely consideration.

"Crutiss Motorcycles ($CMOT) - Curtiss Motorcycles With A New Luxury Electric Bike$CMOT

**Introduction**

I've never really been a bike guy in the past, but recently my uncle got a new motorcycle and it got me thinking about the world of bikes. I've always heard about the tough Harley Davidson guys that have all the flames across them, but I always thought what about electric versions? Is there an explosive or cruising version that could be electric and still have that gritty feeling of a bike? In the depths of the research, I found Curtiss Motorcycles who seems to have fulfilled that niche.

https://preview.redd.it/f12jpnlmcl0a1.png?width=179&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd52303784cce07a69e020ce44209737202007c8

**Who They Are**

Curtiss is a luxury motorcycle company that is creating an electric bike for that new version of the glory days of motorcycles. I honestly haven't found any other companies that have the same level of detail. Most other bike companies have premium or less quality, while Curtiss has the highest level of luxury that demands exclusivity.

https://preview.redd.it/modakfcncl0a1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4b6d4f5b45025dee35c032eadf8e218b7ea4b24

**Product**

The 1(Work of Art Edition) - Currently the only model they have created. It has a battery that would need changing roughly every 7 to 10 years. The entire rest of the bike would last a lifetime given fair maintenance. The bike is able to be charged at home for you convenience, making it very easy as an everyday driver. Production is said to be happening next year and for orders to be going out as well.

It looks very futuristic and a great upgrade for the world of motorcycles. The bike is also fully customizable in terms of colour coding. You can make any colour scheme and make your bike pop and stand out on the road. Making your ride truly a 1 of 1.

https://preview.redd.it/w7j10fjocl0a1.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=99a3df7c6b77b2da1529c1c8f84beeee79172f33

**Macro Trends**

Everyone knows the wonder of the EV market. Tesla is leading the way in cars and potentially the truck with their new edition. Curtiss is looking to lead the market in the bike category. As the world of fossil fuels are being reduced, electric vehicles are becoming cheaper and more accessible for all. Not only would an electric bike be much cheaper on a daily driving basis with the cost of fuel reduced, but also is a lot cleaner and quieter so you can driving knowing your not annoying others.

**Final Thoughts**

I'm not personally in the position to purchase a new vehicle, but for those who are looking for a luxurious new bike Curtiss looks like the one to have. It has great long-term prospects being very cheap to maintain with only the battery needing replacement. The electric aspect is the new trend that doesn't have any showing of slowing down. The 1 by Curtiss Motorcycles is changing the motorcycle industry for the better.

"Quantum Computing To Revolutionize Cyber SecurityIn light of the opportunities and threats presented by quantum computing, many tech companies have taken initiatives in the recent past to develop cybersecurity solutions that address the threats posed by quantum computing while using the same technologies to foolproof their product offering. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one such tech giant at the forefront of this movement. The company, in recent quarters, has highlighted the importance of developing post-quantum cryptography to build encryption systems that cannot be deciphered easily with quantum computing. The company recently launched the NIST Post-Quantum Project, inviting cryptographers worldwide to submit candidates for peer review. Microsoft is currently experimenting with four post-quantum project candidates: FrodoKEM, SIKE, Picnic, and qTESLA. With its deep pockets, Microsoft is well-positioned to spend millions of dollars in R&D investments to build cybersecurity solutions that alleviate the threat posed by quantum computing.

Hub Cyber Security (TASE:HUB) is another company to look out for in the cybersecurity space. The company‚Äôs confidential computing solutions are some of the only ‚Äúquantum-ready‚Äù solutions. HUB is already partnering with QuantLR to develop a quantum security solution for the Israeli Ministry of Defense and other high-end customers such as government entities and multinational organizations. This year, the company has agreed to merge with SPAC Mount Rainier Acquisition Corp. (RNER) and is already collaborating with private and government entities in Israel and other key markets to deploy cybersecurity solutions that address the threat quantum computing poses.

The rise of quantum computing offers opportunities and challenges for the cybersecurity industry. As a result of this, the industry is changing dynamically today. Both established and young companies are developing solutions to protect sensitive data from the risks posed by quantum computing while making the most of this advanced technology. These companies are likely to gain lucrative financial rewards in the long run.

"Sector Rotation And 9 Stocks To Watch During A RecessionIs the United States heading toward a recession?

This has been the looming question on the minds of Americans since inflation topped at 8.5% in March, matched with other indicators such as¬†rising interest rates and the bond market‚Äôs inverted yield curve.

Top economists are split on the inevitability of a recession.¬†Former¬†**Goldman Sachs Group Inc**¬†CEO **Lloyd Blankfein** said over the weekend, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly a very, very high-risk factor,‚Äù but believes that the Fed is responding well to the risk.

**Moody‚Äôs Corporation**  chief economist **Mark Zandi** predicted a 35% probability that America will enter a recession in the next two years. **Twitter Inc.'s**¬†¬†most-loved **Elon Musk** predicted¬†a recession as early as the summer of 2022.

**Conflicting outlooks aside, it is essential to look at the facts and what has historically preceded a recession.**

The yield curve inverted on March 29 for the first time since 2019. This occurs when the short-term U.S. treasury is paying a higher interest rate than long-term U.S. treasuries. More than that, Fed Chair **Jerome Powell** indicated a 50 basis point increase, up from the traditional 0.25% at the last FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.

**The known definition of a recession is a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced, generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters.** According to the Bureau of Economic analysis, the GDP decreased at an annual rate of 1.4%, down from 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021.

**While the macro outlook is pessimistic at best, it is critical to understand the broader market trends that indicate where money moves, such as¬†the economic cycle and sector rotation.**

It is¬†known that a recession is a natural part of a growing economy and¬†as part of the economic cycle. The cycle can be simply defined as when the economy moves from a growth stage to a recession and back to growth. This is probably the most influential force on the broader markets because it directly relates to stock prices vis-a-vis company profits.

The stock market's relationship with the economic cycle lies in the various sectors that make up the markets, which are sensitive to different stages of the cycle.

**Are you confused yet? This should make it easy.**

Some sectors will outperform when the economy is growing (Industrials, Consumer names, Real Estate) and others when the economy is in a recession (Healthcare, Food, Consumer Staples, Utilities)

**This is known as sector rotation or the way investors move money during the various stages of the economic cycle.**

When the economy moves toward a recession, investors usually rotate into sectors that are less sensitive to the economic cycle, such as¬†Consumer Staples and Utilities; these are known as **defensive sectors** because they can offer a relative level of protection during an economic downturn.

Some of those defensive names include:

**Coca-Cola Co** **KO**  
**Albertsons Companies Inc**   
**Altria Group Inc**   
**NRG Energy Inc**   
**PG&E Corporation**   
**Clearway Energy Inc**   
**National HealthCare Corporation**   
**HealthStream, Inc.**   
**Regencell Bioscience Holdings Ltd** 

On the opposite end, when emerging from a recession, investors rotate into highly sensitive names to the cycle, such as¬†**Industrials and Consumer** **cyclicals.**

Some of those names include:

**Caterpillar Inc** 

**CAT**  
**Johnson & Johnson**   
**Ecolab Inc**   
**Chevron Corp.**   
**Tesla Inc**   
**JPMorgan Chase & Co.**   
**Boeing Co**   
**Mastercard Inc**",07-28-2022

"Undervalued Plant-Based Stock PlaysA great investment philosophy is simple. Invest today into tomorrow‚Äôs future. Applied to the food world, this philosophy has one straightforward takeaway: buy vegan and plant based stocks. Plant-based food is the future of eating and over the next decade, the enormous legacy animal-based foods industry is going to be entirely disrupted by emerging plant-based foods companies that are winning over the hearts (and wallets) of young consumers (who, for what it's worth, are becoming the driving force of the global consumer economy).And this trend goes beyond mere investment philosophy; according to Statista, revenue in the e-commerce market is expected to reach $4.15 trillion in 2022 and rise to $5.73 trillion in 2025. This equals a growth CAGR of 11.35% between 2022 to 2025. 

In other words, it‚Äôs time to buy vegan stocks‚Ä¶

The first entry on this list of vegan stocks to buy is the most well known vegan stock of them all: Beyond Meat (BYND). The plant-based meat maker is for all intents and purposes the face of the vegan revolution. The company‚Äôs meatless burgers, sausages, and other meat products are served fresh. Beyond Meat accomplishes this through various fast food chains like Blaze Pizza, Burger King, Carl‚Äôs Jr., and Del Taco. Moreso packaged through various grocery stores. Beyond Meat will be able to leverage its first-mover‚Äôs advantage, strong brand equity,  awareness, advanced faux meat construction process, robust production capabilities, widespread fast-food, and grocery store distribution to sustain leadership in the vegan meat market over the next several years. Indeed, Beyond Meat is seen as the Tesla of vegan meat.

The second on the list and in my eyes the most promising vegan stock at the moment is PlantX ([VEGA.CN](https://VEGA.CN) and VEGA.C). PlantX is fast making a name for itself as the Amazon of the plant-based/health food/vegan community by leveraging a tech-centric approach to capitalize on the massive growth potential of the industry as a whole. As the digital face of the plant-based community, PlantX's platform is the one-stop shop for everything plant-based. The company currently offers over 5,000 vegan products on its ecommerce catalog, as well as meal and indoor plant delivery services.

PlantX continues to report robust month-over-month and year-over-year revenue increases, as shown by previous financial results. For the month of March 2022, the Company generated gross revenue of $1,719,577, reflecting a 28% increase from February 2022, and 168% increase, net of wholesale revenue, compared to the month of March 2021. Following this strong performance up the next month, PlantX recently announced April 2022 revenue growth that are likewise impressive. Last month the company generated monthly gross revenue of $ 1,744,248, representing a 168% increase from April 2021.

The Company‚Äôs ongoing financial progress has been consistent with management‚Äôs efforts to invest in strategic partnerships to accelerate expansion efficiently and proactively. Beyond the growth that PlantX is experiencing, the Company has been heavily investing in maximizing the quality of its current services and programs to better serve its growing customer base.  This growth clearly indicate PlantX‚Äôs potential for consistent growth. As PlantX continues to focus on business to consumer efforts, they are seeing increases in margins while establishing a loyal customer base. Their focus is on investing in quality, innovation, and strategic partnerships, which is clearly a rewarding strategy for PlantX. 

To grow its customer base, the company has formed partnerships with celebrity chefs and well-known vegan brands. PlantX is leveraging the growing e-commerce market to offer high-quality items to the plant-based community. Its products can be found on [thebay.com](https://thebay.com), [amazon.com](https://amazon.com), [walmart.com](https://walmart.com), and [walmart.ca](https://walmart.ca). The company is becoming a go-to plant-based brand with a growing customer base and as it expands its online presence, there will be more lucrative opportunities in the future. PlantX stock currently seems undervalued, which seems to be THE perfect time to invest in the company to gain exposure to the plant-based market.

That's my take on plant-based stocks folks, do your own research and see the overflowing potential for yourself.",05-10-2022
"Show r/StocksAndTrading: Explore correlations between stocks.I built a website that lets you explore correlations between stocks. I built it for myself because I wanted to find stocks that are inversely correlated with Tesla's stock. Maybe the website has value for some of you.

It shows you the 10 most strongly and inversely correlated values of every stock in the database.

I see 3 applications for correlations in regards to investing:

   * Reduce the risk of a portfolio and ensure that assets are not overly correlated.
   * Find an alternative to hard-to-trade assets. For example, it is difficult for a retail investor to trade oil. Therefore, it may make sense to look for investments that strongly correlate with the oil price.
   * To bet against the price of a stock with an inversely correlated stock. If you think a certain stock is overvalued, you can search for stocks with inverse correlations. You can then invest in them, thus creating an implicit short position. This method is much less risky than typical methods such as shorts and put options.

"WHY TESLA COULD BE LARGER THAN GM & FORD COMBINED BY 2027 

#### Key points:

* Morgan Stanley expects Tesla revenue to outshine GM and Ford quicker than you might think
* Tesla recorded year-on-year growth of 63%, whilst the broader market dropped 10%
* Tesla appears well-posiitoned with share donors

Tesla dominates the EV market; we already know that. As companies turn towards the emerging market trend with hopes of securing a slice of the market share; competition is incredibly rife‚Ä¶or is it? How much does Tesla‚Äôs position outweigh the possibilities and approaches of burgeoning EV makers? Not just that, but how much are long-standing automobile favorites like GM and Ford under mounting pressure?

In a recent note from Morgan Stanley, the firm expects Tesla revenues to be larger than GM and Ford combined in the next five years. Tesla is outperforming the market, and that‚Äôs where the long-term outlook derives from.¬†

Tesla's U.S market share was 4% on year-on-year growth of 63%, whilst the broader market volume was down 10% ‚Äì Morgan Stanley expects the full-year market share to stand at around 3.5%. Also, the average Tesla sold commands a price of $60,000, 30% above the US average price, implying, as Morgan Stanley points out, an adjusted ‚Äòwallet share‚Äô of 4.6%.

The firm estimate that Tesla's share of US wallet should reach 10% by 2025 and 13% by 2030. The firm also believes that Tesla is well-positioned with share donors, as movement in a low-growth auto market normally points to a group of share donors.

So, looking at GM, the company‚Äôs market share is expected to drop from 14.6% (2021) to 14% by 2025 and less than 12% by 2030. Similarly, Ford‚Äôs market share is expected to drop from 12.5% (2021) to just over 10% by 2030. With this information, Morgan Stanley expects Tesla‚Äôs revenue share to surpass GM by late 2026/2027.",02-03-2022
"THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD SHORT LUCID GROUP STOCK (LCID) IN FEBRUARY 

#### Key points:

* Lucid stock is down 30% since the start of the year
* With little fundamental developments, are investors hung-up on ambitious projections?
* Growth stocks are likely to remain under pressure by continued market headwinds

The last two years have seriously outlined the reality of EV speculation. Slippery SPAC mergers have revealed fraud allegations, retail traders have overhyped public trading debut‚Äôs, and still, Tesla dominates EV market share. The [Chinese market has proved a critical landscape for sales](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/the-chinese-ev-boom-is-proving-critical-for-overall-tesla-sales/) as the country continues its decarbonization journey one step ahead of the U.S, and [EV charging companies are slowly depreciating](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/heres-why-blink-chargings-new-partnership-isnt-exactly-inspiring/) as demand isn‚Äôt quite where it needs to be.¬†

All in all, it‚Äôs been an exciting time for the emerging market, but I can‚Äôt help wondering how far down the line will we see profitability from the fresh faces on the scene. After all, it should take a little more than ambitious projections to win the bids of investors; especially when the company has next to no data to prove it.

Lucid Group ‚Äì a promising EV manufacturer that does have potential, but in my opinion, not in the short term. Running through some overall technicals, Lucid is still up 168% since its merger in 2020, after reaching prominent heights late last year the stock has continued to drop; now sitting 35% down since the start of the year.¬†

So not a great start to 2022, and there are numerous reasons for this. Unfortunately for the company, due to a hawkish monetary policy, investors are rotating out of high-growth tech stocks amidst rising interest rates and inflationary worries ‚Äì spurring a wide sell-off across the board.¬†

We would love to see this as nothing but a temporary hurdle; but with the fed expected to increase rates multiple times throughout the year, uncertainty is wreaking havoc in the markets with sentiment wavering on a bearish outlook.¬†

Yet this certainly isn‚Äôt the key reason you should be looking to short Lucid. We haven‚Äôt really seen much fundamental change in Lucid‚Äôs pragmatism; just rose-tinted projections met with hollow deadlines. The Lucid Air, which was expected to reach the market in Spring 2021, still hasn‚Äôt gone further than, well‚Ä¶ anywhere really. Sure, [reservations are apparently increasing,](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/lucid-group-stock-rallies-9-after-increasing-vehicle-reservations/) but the company still has nothing to show for itself apart from consistent delays, as well as cutting back 2021‚Äô‚Äôs delivery targets from 6,000 to a mere 520.¬†

A further red flag late last year, Lucid issued a convertible note offering in a [$1.75B debt financing agreement](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/lucid-group-stock-falls-10-following-1-75b-debt-financing-decision/). This is by no means shocking when it comes to new company‚Äôs, and although it can result in stock dilution further down the line, generally isn‚Äôt a problem. In the case of Lucid, stock dropped 10% following the agreement, alluding to the fact that investors were clearly worried about the company‚Äôs financial stability amidst its bold projections with little actual backing.

The only place where Lucid seems to be gaining fundamental traction is the Middle East. January 19th marked the lockup expiration for Lucid; meaning shareholders are able to sell off unwanted stock. Whilst this normally provokes a sharp downside in the market, Lucid stock is being held up by The Saudi Public Investment Fund, which holds a 62.7% stake in Lucid and held its stake following the lockup expiration. It seems that Lucid does hold a strong position in Saudi‚Äôs transformation efforts; with Lucid in advanced talks to establish manufacturing units.¬†

Once again, projections, expectations, and rumors have been the sole catalyst for Lucid‚Äôs sustainability, but I‚Äôm not convinced this will last long, unless we see actual production targets being met, and unless Lucid has the capability to deliver on their well-polished outlook. Although the financial outlook is an important crux of an investment decision; when it comes to Lucid Group, that is all they seem to have. Further market headwinds could increase with the looming conflict in Ukraine, but that isn‚Äôt for certain.¬†

Lucid Group has the potential to capitalize on a portion of market share should they start meeting their targets and continue to impress in the Middle East. In the meantime, however, based on the company‚Äôs position, financial stability, and other market headwinds, I can‚Äôt see Lucid stock finding much support, especially in the next month or so.¬†",01-29-2022

"Tesla Snubs Cybertruck In 2022Shares of Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) dipped 0.80% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the electric vehicle company posted positive earnings mixed with supply chain woes.

Financials: Tesla reported earnings per share of $2.52 and revenue of $17.7 billion; both were better than expected.

Trouble: While the financials looked good for Tesla, including an impressive 29.2% ex-credits automotive gross margin, many investors wanted more from the company. Tesla also said that it experienced challenges related to supply chain, labor, and manufacturing.

Priorities: CEO Elon Musk said during the earnings call on Wednesday that the chip shortage has resulted in the company prioritizing deliveries of current vehicles this year instead of developing new vehicles. That means the company will not roll out its highly-publicized new Cybertruck in 2022.

Final Thoughts: How will Tesla balance demand and supply chain issues in 2022? The company is a giant in the electric vehicle space, but the valuation of the stock is still too high for some investors.

"YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO TAKE TESLA‚ÄôS ‚ÄòIMPRESSIVE DELIVERIES‚Äô FOR FACE VALUE 

* Tesla' ‚ÄòBlockbuster Q4 deliveries' doesn't quite tell the whole story
* Due to safety issues, nearly half a million models were recalled
* Tesla is up 10% and approaches 2021 high's as investors latch on to Q4 positivity

Overall, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) had another stellar year. Sure, there were a few bumps in the road ‚Äì Musk‚Äôs twitter-sparked stock sell-off led to sizeable retracement; but nothing that the EV market cap giant couldn‚Äôt recover from. Tesla has been around for a while now, but more importantly, so has the hype.¬†

Tesla has earned somewhat of a reputation as the ‚Äògolden child' of the EV family; trustworthy, consistent, and well-known, Tesla has made its way to the top through a perfect blend of top-end engineering, the formidable personality of its CEO, and a general aura of excitement‚Ä¶

In light of recent news, disguised by Tesla‚Äôs winning vendetta against the global chip shortage, concerns are arising regarding safety issues in its Model 3 and Model S models. Strangely, investors still appear to be latching on to Tesla‚Äôs stand-alone stance when it comes to the chip shortage that has hit EV manufacturers but hasn‚Äôt affected the dramatic growth of Tesla sales.¬†

The crux of it is, Tesla is currently recalling nearly half a million of its vehicles to address these safety issues that apparently, in the words of the U.S road safety regulator, ‚Äòincrease the risk of crashing‚Äô. Unfortunately for the high-end company, this wasn‚Äôt a one-off misdemeanor ‚Äì the cars affected ranged across model years 2014 to 2021. So looking at the shiny, lucrative exterior of Tesla ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy enough to be enticed, and to be frank, investors would have relished the 50% rise in Tesla stock price from 2020; but a bit of polish won‚Äôt always cover the cracks.¬†

Out of the 936,000 vehicles delivered in 2021, Tesla has had to recall 475,000 ‚Äì nearly equating to the total amount of deliveries in 2020. This should really raise a few red flags for investors, but yet Tesla stock is currently showing a daily gain of around 9% ‚Äì are Tesla investors blinded by unconditional trust in Musk? Or are these callbacks nothing more than a minor pothole in the long road to market share domination? Or perhaps it is the company's chip-shortage navigation that puts the company one step ahead.¬†

Ramping up China production has been huge for the company; [cashing in on government-issued EV subsidies.](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/buyers-flock-to-nio-xpeng-more-to-avoid-2022-subsidy-cuts/) Should safety issues continue to be reoccurring features of Tesla vehicles, we might find inventors opting for other, reliable companies that still offer a low-price entry. However, [Tesla is still very much a force to be reckoned with;](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/hype-aside-these-are-the-3-ev-stocks-you-need-in-your-2022-portfolio/) and buyers will most likely continue to drown out periods of short-lived volatility. Still, the large-scale vehicle callback should act as a wake-up call for many; even the giants have their downfalls.¬†",01-04-2022

"When Tech Eventually Fizzles, Will U.S. Continue to Dominate? Backtesting Excluding Tech vs. Global MarketsEdit: People are misunderstanding the question. I‚Äôm not bearish on tech. It‚Äôs more of a question of US continuing to out perform the global market once the expected returns on tech slows.

TL;DR: As tech‚Äôs strong performance fades (maybe it doesn‚Äôt, but eventually, it might), why should we believe the U.S. market will continue to outperform globally? Has anyone already backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech‚Äîespecially the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù‚Äîand compared its performance to developed and emerging markets?

Over the past 15 years, the U.S. market has massively outperformed global equities, leading to the narrative that U.S. governance, monetary policy, the strength of the dollar (as the global reserve currency), and favorable geopolitical conditions will continue to support this dominance. This view is widely accepted in this community (you can find tons of discussions on this by searching ‚Äúinternational‚Äù here if you haven‚Äôt already).

However, the primary driver of U.S. outperformance has been the tech sector, particularly the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta). A quick search shows that these companies have been responsible for a significant portion of U.S. market returns over the past two decades, with tech alone contributing heavily to the growth of the S&P 500.

But what happens when the tech sector eventually hits a slowdown or correction? While it could continue to dominate for another decade, at some point, the market may shift, and another sector or region could rise to prominence. So, if tech (especially the Magnificent 7) loses its edge, what is left to support U.S. market dominance?

I‚Äôm particularly interested in whether anyone has backtested the S&P 500 excluding tech stocks (especially the MAG 7) and compared its performance against global markets‚Äîboth developed and emerging. Excluding the top tech names from the S&P 500 could provide a more realistic view of the underlying market performance without the distortion caused by these mega-cap stocks, which are arguably overvalued or at least priced for significant future growth.

I‚Äôm asking this because, as a long-term, passive investor, I think the MAG 7 may be overvalued, and their strong returns over the past 15 years might not be sustainable. To further diversify my portfolio, I‚Äôve begun investing in US mid and small-cap S&P funds, but I‚Äôm also looking to increase my exposure to global equities. From what I can see, excluding tech from the equation, international equities don‚Äôt appear to underperform as much relative to U.S. stocks. So, I‚Äôm interested in seeing if global diversification, especially in emerging markets, would still yield solid returns after this adjustment.

A few questions I have:
Has anyone conducted a backtest or analysis of the S&P 500‚Äôs performance excluding the Magnificent 7? How does it compare to global markets, particularly developed and emerging markets?

If tech returns eventually fizzle out (or at least grow more slowly), should we expect the U.S. to continue outperforming? What other sectors or factors might drive U.S. market growth in the future?

I‚Äôve prepared myself for critical feedback‚ÄîDrag me.",12-23-2024
"Every Monday morning I invest $1,885. Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

Please provide any thoughts or constructive criticism below. Thank you",12-20-2024
"Could GOEV (Canoo Inc.) Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only?Hi investing friends, could GOEV (Canoo inc., I've bought quite a significant number of shares at least significant for the budget; always with cross-referencing do your own research and trust your own instincts after the data, always doing due diligence and this is not financial advice) be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents (Bitcoin even started at $0) about a decade and a half ago? It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.'

"Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemesI often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I‚Äôm going to blow your minds a little bit.¬†

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit.¬†

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price.¬†

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc.¬†

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990‚Äôs. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?

I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don‚Äôt think anything I‚Äôm going to say beyond this point is going to help you.

The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.

So, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is ‚Äúa fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.‚Äù

That seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: ‚Äúthe scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.‚Äù This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high.¬†

The part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren‚Äôt able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you‚Äôre essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you‚Äôre able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described.¬†

Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi‚Äôs almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets.¬†

**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year‚Äôs time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there‚Äôs only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud.¬†

I will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.

Returning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again.¬†

I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi‚Äôs on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn‚Äôt a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this.¬†

**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company‚Äôs market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.

**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren‚Äôt), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",12-17-2024
"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More MoneyI've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",12-16-2024
"Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",12-16-2024
"Savings Diversity - General QuestionsSo I have a general question about the cash that I'm keeping on hand.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options? Are there other options I should look into?",12-16-2024

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is¬†**73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).¬†**TL;DR:**

>‚Äú‚Ä¶AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn‚Äôt make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it‚Äôs the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what‚Äôs coming thanks to NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA (moat), among¬†[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).‚Äù

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

"Returning to active stock portfolio managementI recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I‚Äôve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn‚Äôt trading rationally. I‚Äôd look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn‚Äôt offset the losses caused by Bitcoin‚Äôs decline, PaySafe‚Äôs terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin‚Äôs recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn‚Äôt capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I‚Äôve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to ‚Äúbuy low today and sell high tomorrow‚Äù because it‚Äôs too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn‚Äôt pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just ‚Äúokay‚Äù rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",12-12-2024

"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

  
I think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",12-08-2024
"What is your thought on my portfolio and strategy?I'm 30M. I recently started investing in ETF & individual stocks. Below is my portfolio I figured it out myself, but I am not sure if it is reasonable in the long run, and I want to hear other people's opinions, comments, and criticism on it. I put in a lump sum (a large amount of my saving money after I excluded emergency money) and plan to DCA monthly.

**ETF 75%**  
\- iShares Core MSCI World (Acc) - IWDA

**Individual stocks 25%**  
\- **Tech Growth 12%:** Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Palantir, Nvidia, Tesla  
\- **(High-)dividend 5%:** Siemens, Merck & Co, Swiss Re, Exxon Mobil, McDonald  
\- **Consumer defensive 3%:** UnitedHealth, Mastercard, Cola  
\- **Personal favorite 3.5%:** Garmin, Air Product and Chemicals, Walmart, Rolls-Royce, Airbus  
\- **Aerospace & Defensive 1.5%**: Rocket Lab, Howmet, RTX Corp

The reason that my portfolio contains more than 20 stocks is that I want to diversify it in terms of the stocks, not types of assets. 

My concerns/questions are:

1. I'm not sure if I hold too many stocks in the same category (e.g. tech stocks) and most of them are already covered by the IWDA ETF.
2. I'm also considering holding only 1 or 2 high-dividend stocks like AbbVie, instead of 5 dividend stocks. Is it a good idea?
3. My long-term plan follows ""time in the market > timing the market"". So I plan to split DCA in half and put in ETF and stocks equally. I also read about the [Enhanced DCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1b40399/enhanced_dollar_cost_averaging/). Statistically, is the Enhanced DCA worth a try?

All suggestions are welcome. I'm happy to give more information and appreciate any help you can provide. :)",12-05-2024
"A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car IndustryHi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

"Thoughts on Tesla in DecemberSo right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

But I really feel like it is so risky to invest in the stock. Maybe a smal call option just to not miss out but also keep liquidity?",12-01-2024
"Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was BornHi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

"Talking with my dad about Nvidia over ThanksgivingMy dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

"the TRUTH about investing no one tells you# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there‚Äôs **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who‚Äôs really winning here? Hint: it‚Äôs not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn‚Äôt about being the smartest‚Äîit‚Äôs about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here‚Äôs your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it‚Äôs easy to find the next Tesla? It‚Äôs not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can‚Äôt value the stock, you can‚Äôt invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can‚Äôt invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it‚Äôs incredibly hard‚Äîthink Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt win.The winners aren‚Äôt the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

"Need help regarding intrinsic value So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it‚Äôs finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham‚Äôs valuation model ($179.41)

Would you:

A- Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV

B- Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value ($81 would be the average), but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether

"1 Is there a process by which info about a stock goes from insider knowledge to widespread knowledge, and how that relates to bubbles?Warren Buffet once said something like 'be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy'

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors. However Tesla has had both dips and peaks since it lowered from its peak.",07-16-2024

"Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI EraWhenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",07-03-2024
"Diversify once you hit a gain % threshold?Hey everyone, I‚Äôm 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I‚Äôve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it‚Äôs around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight. Is there a threshold in the gain % where you start taking out and diversifying? For example, if I make 500% return on a given stock, anything over I would invest in something else. 

Just want to hear your thoughts because I‚Äôm still young and haven‚Äôt been around too long in the market. I want to use this money for retirement and I‚Äôm a pretty stable investor (I invest for the long run, no day trading). Thank you",07-02-2024

We all know the price of bitcoin now. I have thought of jumping into crypto with something like SHIB where I could buy a ton of shares for little to nothing with spare cash. 
I already have some safe investments in mutual funds and Tesla stock but hoping to ride the wave of something and crypto seems like a good wave to ride. Do I need to think differently about investing in crypto? I can't even use my Charles Schwab account to buy. ",06-19-2024
"Selling NVDA with $1m gainsI‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I‚Äôve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I‚Äôm sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I‚Äôm a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I‚Äôm also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can‚Äôt really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can‚Äôt imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I‚Äôve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

"Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!)I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

I only ask this question over here in this sub because I wanna hear the community's thoughts. 

As it stands, Tesla has a total shares outstanding of 3.189 Billion. Something along those lines.

"Musk/Tesla Insider trading question\*\*I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn't give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry.

Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.

I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?

Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I‚Äôm still well within the ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôm just lucky‚Äô phase since it‚Äôs only been a couple years, but I‚Äôve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past:¬†

1. Insight¬†
2. Conviction¬†
3. Patience

**Insight**

I‚Äôve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).¬†

Ben Graham‚Äôs quote rings true:¬†

>‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.‚Äù

Perhaps counterintuitively, I‚Äôve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.¬†

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.¬†

# Math

In 2023 I also started¬†practicing math daily¬†(243 days straight¬†as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I‚Äôd done any meaningful math.¬†

I‚Äôm not sure how much, but it¬†*feels*¬†like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.¬†

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.¬†

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.¬†

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I‚Äôve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I‚Äôm happy I did.¬†

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.¬†

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,¬†you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I‚Äôm much more patient in my investing these days and don‚Äôt react to the day-to-day.¬†

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

"How, and what are the best way to financially analyze growth companies? Hey folks! I have a question‚Äîhow to analyze a growth company.

"NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV MarketInvesting in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

"Are EVs a bad investment right now?The EV industry, previously recognized as an area of growth and technological advancement, now appears to be under considerable pressure. Recent developments reveal a general downturn across the sector, with Tesla, one of many players, implementing significant job cuts. The company has announced a reduction of over 14,000 jobs worldwide, particularly impacting its major operations in the U.S. and China.

Elon attributes these layoffs to a drop in sales and increasing competition in the EV market. This decision is reflective of broader challenges facing the industry, not just Tesla. A recent analysis indicates a significant reduction in job postings among leading EV manufacturers over the past three months. This trend could be an early indicator of the challenges that lie ahead for the sector, suggesting a possible reevaluation of growth strategies among these companies.

"What if self driving takes over?Hey,

First of all. Do you think is it realistic that self driving takes over and becomes a normal thing?

With the progress of technology we‚Äôre really not that far, fsd 12.3.4 is doing really good and we probably full self driving without supervision could be legal in the next 10-20 years.

If it does, we‚Äôll be having an interesting progress of :

- TSLA : will may be in the top 10; actually they‚Äôre selling the self driving as a subscription of 99$ monthly, what if every Tesla owner have this feature?

UBER : if Uber replace all drivers by self driving cars. They‚Äôll be saving all payrolls and injecting it to develop other delivery business (could be drones delivery; maybe I went too far but it‚Äôs feasible).  There‚Äôs a lot of potential and whatever between 45$-55$ is a good buy price.

"Is it easy to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù now?Short question, if you invest in the top tech companies, is it easy to beat the marketing meaning the S&P?

We‚Äôve all heard the mantra ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never beat the market‚Äù but is that really true any more or does the phrase need some sort of updating?

I‚Äôve been investing for 15 years now and I think I be beat the market or at least the overall S&P500 every single year.  There might have been a year that I nominally missed but if you add up all my investments and look at the gains, it‚Äôs significantly higher than if I just invested in a boring S&P ETF.  My Fidelity account does this for me automatically and I‚Äôve always been higher‚Ä¶for over a decade now. 

So hear me out, I‚Äôve made some dumb mistakes and lost $$$ along the way but my winners have always offset that. My game plan is pretty simple: always invest in large cap stocks.  

With a diverse portfolio made up of Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook (now meta), Amazon, Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, Amd, and a few others, I‚Äôve found this sector completely destroys the overall ‚Äúmarket.‚Äù Sure I have a few outliers like Home Depot and OLIN but when I look at my pie chart, it‚Äôs very aggressive and very heavily in tech.  

The difference in the S&P vs the NASDAQ confirms this over the last 20 years or more and you could argue I‚Äôve built my own sort of NASDAQ mutual fund in a ways, but I‚Äôm still beating the NASDAQ too.  

The contrarian‚Äôs argument is that given enough time, my large cap tech picks will eventually falter and I will begin losing but at the amount I‚Äôm up right now, for over a decade, that correction would have to be astronomical and I don‚Äôt see how the whole world economy wouldn‚Äôt fall if these tech picks crash down 50% at once.  

I‚Äôm not trying to brag or troll this group or anything like that.  I‚Äôm just genuinely interested to know if tech has made it relatively easy to now beat the overall market, and if so, what consequences does that have on the stability of the whole market if more investors start doing what I‚Äôm doing?  

Is there a point where the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù is all tech now?  It sure feels like the S&P is so heavily weighted by tech now that maybe that‚Äôs the real underlying answer to my question.  ",04-03-2024
"Frustrated with the amount of scammers in the financial spaceHello,

It feels like almost everyone in the financial sector is a scammer sometimes. I know this isn't strictly true, but man the scammers are everywhere.

I was doing research on Sam Bankman Fried in the past week, and even when I searched for terms like ""financial scam"" or ""financial fraud"" or whatever the exact terms I used, I got results back from known scammers like Warrior Trading, who was going to warm me of frauds!

I clicked on a Youtube video from 60 minutes on Sam Bankman Fried, and I said to myself, 60 minutes won't scam me. And then Michael Lewis comes on and starts shilling for SBF. What the heck??

Didn't Michael Lewis write a book about toxic assets, which were then sold to investors as safe and AAA and then leveraged to the hilt, from various Wall St. banks and credit ratings agencies, in a combination of folly/stupidity and greed/fraud? The main question often was what percentage was stupidity and what percentage was scamming the public. That was The Big Short.

Here Lewis takes the side of someone who embezzled billions, freerolled the bezzle with an insane risky bet, recommended lots of shitcoins to unsuspecting investors, encouraged them to use even more risks with derivative bets on these shitcoins, and then outright stole what remained from investors to prop up his failing crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, which has lost billions in bad trades.

CNBC and Bloomberg are always hyping various scams. Elon Musk posts he will make a flying car at Tesla a few years ago, the stock jumps double digits on the news, and CNBC hypes it up. Then invite Michael Saylor to pump his crypto scheme even though he was a scammer way back from the dot com bubble. His firm had major accounting ""issues"" and somehow he is still not only CEO of his stupid company, but invited to pump it while he is dumping shares and has been selling consistently for the past six months or so.

I remember when CNBC was endlessly hyping Nikola and their electric truck and then a few weeks later that was revealed to be a scam and the truck towed up a hill and then a fancy promo is shot making it look like it's running on EV power and CNBC never apologized at all!

Don't get me started on WallStBets and RDDT or DJT. It's scams all the way down!",03-31-2024

"Once a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely too lateOnce a Hot Stock-Market Trend Has a Name, Its Best Days Are Likely Past -- Journal Report  
March 1, 2024 (Dow Jones)  
By Derek Horstmeyer  
Once a stock-market trend has been identified and named -- think FAANG or the Magnificent Seven -- the headiest gains are typically past. But riding a trend after it has been named can deliver market-beating returns for another year or so before the trade loses momentum and gives back some of the gains.  
To study the performance of named stock-market trends, my research assistants (Matthew Rickard and Camila Mar√≠n Builes) and I did a deep-dive on eight named trends over the past 10 years that were popularized by the mainstream media and covered by more than three such organizations.  
The final list of named trends we researched was:  
\-- Watch -- for retailers Walmart, Amazon.com, Target, Costco Wholesale and Home Depot.  
\-- FANG -- for tech titans Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet.  
\-- FAANG -- for Facebook, Amazon, Apple (the second A after 2017), Netflix and Google.  
\-- Granola -- for big European companies GSK, Roche, Nestl√©, L'Or√©al, LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, ASML Holding, AstraZeneca, SAP and Sanofi.  
\-- The Magnificent Seven -- for tech giants Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft.  
\-- MT SAAS -- for cloud-computing players Microsoft, Twilio, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon and Shopify.  
\-- BAT -- for Chinese tech firms Baidu, Alibaba Group and Tencent.  
\-- Cloud -- for emerging cloud-computing stocks, notably PayPal, Zoom Video Communications, Vimeo, Dropbox, Alphabet, Adobe and Salesforce  
Smaller named trends like Mamaa (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet) and Emcloud were omitted because of overlap with other named trends, and their inclusion wouldn't have changed results.  
From first mention  
Next, we identified the first date each trend was mentioned in the popular press. Then, for each named trend we looked at the stock returns around this date going back 24 months before the zero-date (date of first mention) and 24 months after the zero-date.  
For each named trend, we use an equal weighting to calculate the return of the trade. So, for instance for FAANG, we applied a 20% weight to Meta's return, a 20% weight to Apple's, a 20% weight to Amazon's, 20% to Netflix and 20% to Alphabet. Finally, we calculated the cumulative excess returns over time for each named trend, where the excess return is the return for the trade minus the return on the S&P 500.  
The first interesting finding: When we look at the average of all these eight named trends, we see considerable price run-up before the trade being named. For the 24 months before the zero-date, we see the average named trend deliver 36% in excess returns. This means that if you magically knew about a new named trend before it happened, you could earn 36 percentage points above the S&P 500 for the two years before it was named.  
Worth the ride, until...  
But even if you don't have this magical foresight, it still doesn't hurt to ride a trend once it has been coined. On average, once the trend has been named and looking ahead 12 months, an investor can still earn about 13 percentage points in excess returns.  
Yet 12 months following the naming is about the best you can do as returns peak at this point on average and decrease a bit subsequently. From the 12-month mark to the 24-month mark after a trend has been named, the average named trend lags behind the S&P 500 by about 2 percentage points.  
When we look at the individual named trends, it might surprise people that the two best trades from the zero-date to the 24-month mark in our sample were the BAT and Cloud trends -- both earning more than 60% in excess return over the two-year period once they were coined by the press.  
On the other end, the MT SAAS trade did the worst, dropping more than 95% in excess returns over the two-year period after being named.  
All in all, this means your best option is to jump on a named trend as soon as you first hear about it -- provided you haven't been too late to the party -- and ride the initial momentum, if it happens. But if you get in past the 12-month mark, the returns might not be so magnificent.

The bet on Tesla to be a robotics leader is the biggest gamble however they need to do something to justify their tech valuation because at the moment their primary source of profit stems from automobiles and as opposed to previous predictions they will not have a monopoly over this industry when the EV revolution is realized.

"Is China set for ""finally"" bottom and an epic rally?DISCLAIMER: This post can disturb US readers:

  
What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:  


|In Millions|2014|2023|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491|
|Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583|
|Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|

When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a ""value play"" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)

China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)

Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.

* BYD took over TESLA. 
* eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions
* They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei

China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life. An order has been implemented where they will still exist, but won't cross lines with their algorithms as happened on our side - we are sorrounded by fake news, extreme division, teenagers suicide rate very high, adults depressed and anxiety, etc...

That story is over - I believe China is set to rally and this is the bottom (you read it here first). Recent news signalling this:

"NVIDIA - 2023 Q4 earnings projections[The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware)](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook):

*Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*  


***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***    


**Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**  


META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:

[*‚ÄúBy the end of this year, we‚Äôre going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.‚Äù*](https://www.pcmag.com/news/zuckerbergs-meta-is-spending-billions-to-buy-350000-nvidia-h100-gpus)  
, which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *""find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute""* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.  

  
I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)  
Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.   
Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.   


Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.  


Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).   


The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.   


**\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.

[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).    
A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.     
2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.   
Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.   
No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.

  
Last note,

the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.

"Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause. 

> These captains of the SS S&P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?

> Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&P 500 depending on which day you look at it.

> Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?

> Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.",01-20-2024
"No one knows anything: Here‚Äôs How Barron‚Äôs Stock Picks Performed‚Äîand Why We Trailed the Market>  Investors who avoided the tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven last year were almost guaranteed to underperform the market. Unfortunately, Barron‚Äôs writers only picked one‚ÄîTesla

**The magnificent seven ‚Äú‚Äîreturned 112% on average last year, versus a 12.5% gain for the other 493 names in the S&P 500‚Äù**

> Those omissions proved costly on the scorecard of Barron‚Äôs 2023 stock picks. The 77 companies featured in bullish articles returned 9.9% on average from the date of publication to the end of the year. Their benchmarks returned 12.7% from the same dates. The two bearish picks featured in the magazine moved in opposite directions, for an average gain of 30.2%.

William Goldman, famous screenwriter and novelist (Princess Bride, All The Presidents Men, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid,etc) wrote a book on his life in Hollywood with the tag of no one knows anything. This was directed at studio execs who couldn‚Äôt predict flops or hits or who would be a star and everyone was often wrong on their guesses. 

I was impressed that Barrons came out and showed their abysmal stock picking record and how if you blindly put your money in the leaders you would have crushed the so-called experts.

"20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 yearsHello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. 

I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.

https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e

The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.

So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. 

So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. 

Here is my list so far. 

1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )
2. Costco
3. Johnson and Johnson
4. Waste Management
5. CVS
6. Home Depot
7. Boeing
8. Caterpillar
9. GE Aerospace
10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia
11. Walmart/Target
12. Starbucks / McDonalds
13. UPS
14. JP Morgan / Bank of America
15. Berkshire / Markel
16. Disney
17. Tesla / GM
18. Hershey
19. Dollar General
20. Lockheed Martin

Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. 

Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.

Edit: Some really good points in the comments. 

1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment 
2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?",01-18-2024
"Apple and Tesla may no longer be ‚Äòsafe investments‚Äô as China‚Äôs troubles grow**From Marketwatch:**

> China represented a 19% chunk of Apple‚Äôs revenue in 2023, and roughly 22% for Tesla in the first nine months of last year. 

This makes them ‚Äúthe two most China exposed companies,‚Äù of the Magnificent Seven. 

> Apple recently cut handset prices in the China where it battles competitors like Huawei. Tesla also reduced EV prices in the country where Berkshire Hathaway-owned BYD rules. 

‚ÄúFrom Peter Navarro, former White House trade adviser under President Donald Trump:‚Äù

> ‚ÄúLike GE before it, Apple and Tesla now have this grim mercantilist reality. Because Mr. Cook and Mr. Musk each directed the offshoring of the vast bulk of Apple‚Äôs and Tesla‚Äôs production to China , the companies are at the mercy of a merciless dictator in Xi Jinping,‚Äù he writes.

China is also in the midst of population woes and a stagnating economy. With US sanctions fears adding fuel. 

**From Barrons:**

> We expect the sequential growth momentum of the Chinese economy to stabilize at a subdued level over the course of 2024, with annual growth slowing to 4.4% in 2024 as the reopening effects fade, the property sector remains a drag, and government policies focus on containing downside risks rather than providing a major growth boost,‚Äù wrote Julius Baer economist Sophie Altermatt in a research note on Wednesday.

> Shaky consumer confidence and concerns over China‚Äôs demographics‚Äîthe population shrank for the second year in a row in 2023‚Äîare bad news for the e-commerce operations that big Chinese technology companies have built their businesses on.

**EDIT:** Crikey guys, I‚Äôm just quoting news to hopefully enrich this sub. But the articles ‚Äúpick on‚Äù the two most fan-fave companies and the debate I‚Äôm seeing sounds a lot like cheerleading. I have 0 invested in either. Just passing on news cuz I finally knuckled down and got some subscriptions. But plz don‚Äôt vent on me, I‚Äôm just a messenger. ",01-17-2024
"What industries are you most bullish on this year? Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?I‚Äôm paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track & trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.  
The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).

  
EV‚Äôs are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There‚Äôs not much to compare it with and no, it hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù.

  
Also, let‚Äôs not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We‚Äôre seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).  
I‚Äôm currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:  
$ALB - My safety net play  
One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).

  
$LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play  
One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I‚Äôve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company/stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource. (Lithium carbonate equivalent). For context, anything worth 1million tonnes is likely to attract major institutional capital.  
Does anyone else share by bullish outlook? What are your 2024 lithium/metals bets?

"Tesla stock grab ultimatumI just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is (practically) demanding he have his voting power **doubled** in the company. This after he sold huge chunks, such as to finance buying Twitter. 

>  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company‚Äôs stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.

> ‚ÄúI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can‚Äôt be overturned,‚Äù Musk wrote in a post on X. ‚ÄúUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.‚Äù

So the 2nd block he‚Äôs essentially threatening to spin off and make competition. 

But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?

Is this some insider key to the sell off they‚Äôve been experiencing? Cuz it‚Äôs frankly scary to me. And it‚Äôs scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company. 

OR am I blowing things out of proportion? I admit I don‚Äôt follow the company religiously and for all I know musk makes a post like this every month. 

What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs take?",01-16-2024

"Any means of getting exposure to Fidelity?With the Bitcoin ETFs, and a ton of brokerage firms banning the purchase of them, I believe Fidelity will take their business.

"20 yr with low expenses in HCOL areaBeen working since I was 18 and started investing little by little middle of 2023. Opened up a webull taxable account with at first just a few Tesla shares then I learned about different stocks and hold a variety of companies I think are solid and I did end in the green although I didn‚Äôt take profits. 

As title suggests I live with my parents in the California Bay Area and would like to stay here and I‚Äôm pretty frugal cuz I basically have everything taken care of for me besides paying my dad $250 as my rent and occasional car expenses(used and paid off). He intends to essentially give back what I‚Äôve paid over the years as well. 

So anyways I ended up with over 50k in my taxable account in stocks in 2023 and only a few I regret slightly but just wondering since my objective is to grow this money to afford a townhome/house here in the bay in like 6/8 years, is this the right route for me opposed to putting in an ira or saving all income with 5% apy?

I was able to perform a mega backdoor Roth and contribute a large sum to my Roth IRA. I‚Äôm mostly invested in a target date fund but have been buying solely VTSAX for the last couple years and will likely continue to do so with my yearly backdoor Roth. 

I‚Äôm thinking instead of VTSAX, invest the mega backdoor contribution into VOO for a little bit of variety or maybe 75% VOO and 25% into individual stocks (Tesla, Apple, etc - haven‚Äôt decided which specifically yet).

"Navigating the Electric Vehicle Landscape as a New InvestorHey fellow investors!  
  
I'm a relatively new investor, particularly focussing on long term investments. I spent most of 2023 learning the ropes of valuing companies and now I'm eager to explore a specific industry.  
  
Lately, I've been drawn to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. While it's tempting to dream of picking the next Tesla, I'm mindful that savvy investors often analyze historical data, seeking common trends that make sense as the sector matures. This includes looking at the miners of essential metals, as well as the hardware and technology necessary for battery production.  
  
To the seasoned investors out there, armed with your current knowledge, what advice would you share with your past selves when initially venturing into this space? Where should one start, and what pitfalls should be avoided?",01-04-2024

"Sell low priced stock with high volume or low volume of high priced stock?Hi guys,

I received some shares from my dad which are in the second biggest German bank, Commerzbank.

They're a lot, like 775 piece, but the price has fallen from like a high of 200 before the financial crisis to 2008 to a meager 10 euro per share. And the last few years, it has barely moved, performing atrociously.

On the other hand, I bought some stocks in Apple, Nvidia, Tesla and they've performed quite well, e.g. Nvidia is up 100%, but I only own a bit, like 20-30 shares.

However, both investments are worth around 8000 dollars lol, and I thought about liquidating one position because I need cash at the moment.

Would you sell option A (huge amounts of Commerzbank shares) or option B (low volume of high-growth stocks) if you needed the money today? And if so, why?",12-20-2023
"Entertaining recommendation for spare change in IRAFinally rolled over some old 401K's from Fidelity into an IRA in my Schwab account.     Put the money in, bought a few thousand shares of some ETF's and life is ok.  Managed to allocate all but $0.06 (6 cents) which I was wiling to ignore.

Since then I've gotten a little bit of interest and cash in my IRA has creeped up to ~$2.50.  Not enough to really do anything with, but I'd rather buy a fractional share of something that can attempt to grow or create dividends rather than leave it in cash.   Plus if more cash shows up I'd like to start figuring out a plan.

So any thoughts on stocks that would be worth throwing spare change at?    And, to be fair, i could just buy a 2% fraction of Apple or some other MANGA stock, or buy an old blue chip or Coke or whatever.... but what would be more entertaining to see in my IRA that won't risk the spare change too much?

$2 invested into a dildo company just for the laughs would be far more amusing than $2 in Tesla.",12-19-2023

Are they shooting for the moon? trying to look like they are ahead of the curb, or masking their slow roll into EV's? Is their Mirai vehicle not working out?

She already sold her stock. If I understand correctly (and please correct me if I'm mistaken), as a result of the settlement, the directors will have to pay some money back to the company. That could, in turn, affect the stock price.

Since she already sold her stock, one could argue that the company was valued lower than it should have been at the time she sold, because the company had 700M less in cash. 1) can she get any of the money being returned, 2) will she do so if she doesn't do anything in response to this notice, or 2) does she need to do anything to try and get some of that?",11-18-2023
"Taking advantage of a panic sell.90% of portfolio is in boring low risk etf‚Äôs or bonds. I‚Äôm more concerned with putting a large amount of my income away than maximizing returns.

With that said. Maybe a week or so ago Tesla (4% of my portfolio) sold off like 10% I think. I immediately doubled my position with cash, not margin) today after the stock recovered I sold my original holding for a loss and kept the newer holding that is up 10%.

"ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.  
Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.  
Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.

ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.  
  
Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.   
  
HazelTree ranks short bets with a ""Crowdedness Score"" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.  
  
In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).   
  
The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).   
  
The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.   
  
HazelTree said it tracks how ""hot"" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.   
  
Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.   
  
Exxon is down about 6% year-to-date, while Tesla has gained a whopping 76% this year but is dealing with headwinds stemming from uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition that has led to price cuts on its vehicles over the course of 2023. ",11-09-2023
"The case for/against diversifying ex-USA?I've read many people rooting for ex-USA diversification. My question is, what would the drivers of growth be for the rest of the world vs the USA? I could see the case for emerging markets outperforming, but can't really see how developed markets like England, Germany, France, Japan, etc. could out of nowhere just start being super innovative/productive and start cranking out Teslas, Apples, and Microsofts. 

I think at worst the US will perform similarly to these countries, and at best will keep on being the driver of innovation/tech in the world due simply to its culture of innovation and hardcore capitalism (which has many, many cons).

Would anyone not advise me to invest all that money into Lockheed Martin?",10-18-2023
"Should I remove my current tech stocks from my portfolio?I started investing a considerable amount of money by the end of 2021. Since then, I have been learning and studying different assets and I got interested in tech stocks and ETFs, among other sectors.

Right now techs represent almost 40% of my portfolio (stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Tesla or Spotify and an ETF that includes the 500 top tech US stocks) and after the AI boom I feel very exposed, even though it is not certain if we are heading to a recession nor we are in another tech bubble. I sold Nvidia a couple months ago thinking it would reverse after its huge rise and it actually continued to grow until now. 

What are your thoughts about this? Should I just hold it all? Or maybe it would be a good idea to check and adjust some positions to reduce my exposure until the bubble deflates (if there's such bubble)?",10-18-2023

Tesla cut the price of some Model 3 and Model Y versions in the U.S. after the company reported third-quarter deliveries that missed market expectations.  
  
The starting price for the Model 3 is listed at $38,990 on Tesla‚Äôs website, down from $40,240 previously. The long range Model 3 fell from $47,240 to $45,990. And the Model 3 Performance fell to $50,990 from $53,240.  
  
Tesla‚Äôs Model Y Performance sports utility vehicle now starts at $52,490, down from a previous price of $54,490.

Beginning at the end of last year, Tesla began cutting the prices of its cars across the world in a bid to stoke demand amid concerns over slowing consumer spending in markets like the U.S. and China and as competition in the electric vehicle space ramped up.

"How Much Is Tesla Worth? You DecideWall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.

The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today‚Äôs dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla‚Äôs other operations are worth.

The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:

1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars

2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.

3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations

4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations

Their assumptions are as follows:

> Our model is based on estimates of Tesla‚Äôs future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year‚Äôs FactSet analyst consensus.

> Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.

> Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla‚Äôs cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla‚Äôs core automotive business now.

> We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company‚Äôs cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.

Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.

"Need advice on allocationHello, guys. I need your opinion. I am in my early 30s and I am planning on investing ~200k. I have just made Fidelity Roth IRA account and will be maxing out contributions there (prob 100% VTI) and planning on allocating rest of the funds. I know that portfolio will heavily depend on individual‚Äôs risk tolerance, but i was wondering if this break down makes sense in terms of risk management. I will be moving within 2~3 yrs so won‚Äôt be starting mortgage any time soon.

Here‚Äôs my rough plan: 

30% VOO

30% VTI -> ‚ùóÔ∏èsuggested to VT

20% Fidelity SPAXX that has interest rate of ~4.97% (i assume this is default for cash sitting in Fidelity brokerage account, please correct me if i am wrong) 
-> ‚ùóÔ∏èsuggested to be increased, maybe incorporate other HYSA/CD?

20% into actual stocks - im thinking about around 10-15 conpanies, candidates being tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Apple, Tesla and non-tech companies like Berkshire Hathaway (prob will need ~5 more good retail/nontech companies)
-> ‚ùóÔ∏èsuggested to be decreased, if not 0.




My goal is to hopefully go aggressive enough for 10~15% gains per year and later, put half into mortgage downpayment. -> ‚ùóÔ∏èrealistic annual return ~7%

"How do I diversify? Trying to move out of single stocks into ETFs.I have a taxable brokerage account worth about 260k currently. 

There are currently 93 positions and account is mainly being carried by big tech stocks (Apple/AMD/Tesla) and a bunch of others for 1-2k each gain/loss.

How do I go about the process of getting out of these single stocks into ETF/Index Funds? I am worried about having to pay taxes on anything I sell but is this just part of the game? Sell something, buy something else, and pay taxes on whatever gains are from the stock I sold?

What about losses? I barely know anything about tax loss harvesting. 

I am kind of just trying to figure out if there is anyway to clean up this portfolio for myself for the future.

Thanks to all in advance!!

"What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?

# Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters

5-6 minutes  
2023-08-08  
Toby Nangle   
The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager  
This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.  
With such a high proportion of a market‚Äôs value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.  
Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market‚Äôs stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.  
Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.  
In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.  
Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits ‚Äî even after taking into account dividends.  
Bessembinder‚Äôs work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers ‚Äî with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.  
Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies ‚Äî even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region‚Äôs equity index can be something of a dark art.  
Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L‚ÄôOr√©al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.  
If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It‚Äôs easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&P 500 rally ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta ‚Äî might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market‚Äôs valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It‚Äôs hard to take a view on companies that don‚Äôt yet exist.  
I‚Äôve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.  
But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets ‚Äî or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known ‚Äî have such a lousy record.  
The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder‚Äôs research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.",08-08-2023
"Growth Stocks Ideas Non-TechI‚Äôve been trying to help my dad set up a new portfolio. We‚Äôve decided to go with a split between dividends, and value/growth. I‚Äôve taken care of the dividends side of things with him already, but I‚Äôm looking for some growth stocks that he can trade short-term (short term being a time interval of a few weeks to a few months or a year or two). I‚Äôve already taken care of the ETFs side of things, so please, stock recommendations only.

However, he seems to not want to invest in many tech companies, so things like AI or TESLA are out of the pictures. I e tried researching online for growth opportunities in other sectors, and have found a few things, but am wondering if any of you might have some suggestions for me to look into.

One final note. I noticed he prefers stocks that have a current share price below $100. Not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs more comfortable with I guess. I know it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but it‚Äôs his call.

"S&p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AIGreetings!  


I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).  


Investing into S&P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.  


I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.  


With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.   


What would you do and why if AI is the goal ? Just buy the Stocks or ETFs ?

"Compounding interest and issue with exchange rateI have this issue with the exchange as I am in the UK and holding GBP in my account.

I am buying the stocks when the price is low and once the price goes up I am selling and the purchase more stocks with the the profit earned . For example I bought tesla Stock at a $181.33 , then I sold some shares at $262.03.  After that I reinvested the same amount back into the at $252.2.  Each time I make a transaction I get hit with fx  impact (currency exchange)  with trading 212.

"What Am I Missing in my Analysis?Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). 

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...

So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?",06-29-2023

&#x200B;

I'm currently trying to brainstorm things that may factor into the decision to invest in a company that doesn't rely wholly on impulse. Here are some potential categories that may eventually turn into some sort of journaling or flowchart. I'd love your input as well.

\-What is the short interest? (How many days to cover all shorts based on average volume and total shorted shares? 8 days supposedly it gets hairy for bears)

\-What is the volatility?

\-What pattern is emerging or is it trading?

\-Why is it trading higher or lower? (faith in the product, news, cult of personality, faith in leadership, hedging against presumed cycles, et cetera)

\-Is it near support or resistance?

\-What is the price in relation to moving averages? (9, 20, 50, 200 day)

\-Has there recently been a cross up/down?(Seemingly very reactive on the 4 hour chart)

\-Is it filling a gap?

\-What volume is the price based on? (One trader accidentally paying way over market value at 5 AM doesn't mean everyone is going to pay that)

\-Are fund managers likely buying? (you don't affect the market, they do)

\-Is this a long-term or a short-term play?

\-Some people trade the same stocks every day--What does the chart tell you about their habits? (Does volume drop off at a certain time? Do bears take over early only for the stock to rebound? Does everyone seem to take a long lunch away from their trade station?)

\-Price to book ratio? (If they liquidated today, how much would they still have?)

\-Is this stock moving in sympathy with and industry? (Are there cheaper stocks in this industry trading in sympathy that you could increase profit potential with?)

\-What's coming down the pike? (For instance, currently Tesla is dominating because their charging stations are becoming the industry standard. Also in the news is that Honda and other companies are signing on to an agreement to use blockchain to trace the footprint of the minerals used in their batteries. If this becomes a regulation/requirement, will Tesla drop if less-than-scrupulous sources of lithium are discovered?)

\-Based on your own experience, what might you be able to forecast that others may not due to proximity? (E.G. How many fuel trucks can you see going into the pipelines, how many new fracking rigs can you see from the road, What are the names on the rigs? Et cetera)((Ben Graham said not to invest in things you don't understand, right? You don't understand AI--stay out))

And I wasn't predicting the oil price downward correction of last week, past-OPEC output cut neither. In a market context where commodities prices are becoming less and less predictable, what do you consider to be the most suitable ones for investment at this stage?",04-24-2023
"Lifecore: Opportunity or Bust?Been following Lifecore (ticker: LFCR) for the past few of days. I believe the stock is a compelling long but would appreciate some pushback.

Lifecore is an oddity in the pharma industry. It has two main business branches in two very different sectors. One is the CDMO business that manufactures injectables for drug companies. Another one is their commodity Curation Foods business. Salad, avocado, olive oil, etc. This combination makes no sense at all but if you ever read Joel Greenblatt's fancy title books you'd be intrigued by possible shift in business mix. Perhaps a spin-off or other corporate action would unlock shareholder value...

Well that's exactly what is happening right now. On March 16th, Lifecore made three important announcements.

1. 2023 Q2 results with 11% revenue decline, going concern notice, and statements on breach of covenants.
2. Expansion of contract with existing customer including 10m upfront payment in cash and up to 15m capex reimbursement.
3. Statement on looking for strategic alternative.

So what does this mean for the stock? First trading day after the announcement, the market reacted violently. The stock plunged 70%. High debt level combined with going concern notice and exploration of strategic alternative is almost never a happy marriage and it wasn't a great start. Moreover, in months leading to Q2 announcement, Lifecore issued a note telling investors that previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon due to errors found in its Curation Foods business. Doomed! Or so it seemed. Interestingly, the stock went up 80% on the following trading day and has since held its ground in $3-4 range despite reasonably high borrow fees for shorting this name. Perhaps there's more to the story.

I decided to go over the business this past weekend and found a few more interesting items.

1. The company has an activist investor on the board and has been selling off its Curation Foods business for the last few years. They sold their avocado segment this year and now olive oil sale completes the sale of Curation Foods segment. Prior to this sale, I believe this was the last remaining thorn in Lifecore path towards receiving forbearance from lenders as well as attracting the best possible bids. Lifecore is finally a pure CDMO play well positioned to capture bids from both financial and strategic buyers. These assets are highly valued and often trade at EV/EBITDA multiple of larger than 15 due to regulatory and technical reasons. Lifecore guided around 32.5 million before the meltdown and winning their largest contract to date would most likely push EBITDA run rate to \~40m.
2. The revenue decline only happened for non-material reasons. Their customer pushed the schedule back by a quarter or two and hence the quarter numbers looked disappointing. But this means next quarter or the following one should have higher than normal numbers.
3. The liquidity statement is most likely the result of covenant breach and they should have enough cash on hand to run the business. Why? They just sold their avocado business for 17.5m (goes into paying down debt) and got 38.75m in converts with $7 strike price. They have enough cash to run the business and fund their capex. My best guess is that miscalculating the timing of (2) probably had some impact on the covenants and they now need to negotiate the terms with lenders. Right now these debts are callable at any moment and that's probably why they needed to issue the liquidity statement. Technically, they don‚Äôt have enough cash right now to meet the theoretical obligations that could arise from accelerated debt payment. Does it make sense for creditors to call the debts? No. They are much better off letting the sale process go through and getting a kick back for granting forbearance.
4. They hired Morgan Stanley for their strategic alternative process. If Morgan Stanley is the Morgan Stanley I know, they would not advise companies on a tiny 6 million dollar deal that may or may not go through. It's not the olive oil deal that needs Morgan Stanley. This is most likely the sale of the entire company. For what it's worth, when I interviewed for Morgan Stanley internship a while ago, the interviewer told me that they don't look at deals below 500m--pretty sure they do look at smaller deals as well but guessing it's the minority. I went to buyside straight out of college so don't have any first hand experience there but is more or less in line with conversations I had with friends in bulge bracket banks. Moreover, Morgan Stanley advised on a similar deal last year when Alcami traded hands. Lifecore has the right advisor.
5. The interest level in CDMO asset is wild. They have been steadily growing and industry experts I've spoken to all agree that they are most likely getting dozens of bids right now. Given that board owns significant amount of shares and the company has set its sight on sale process, we have the right conditions for maximization of shareholder returns.
6. The short interest increased going into the belated Q2 announcement on March 16th and since then FINRA data suggests that good amount of shorting has taken place. Historically, high short interest led to poor stock performance but occasionally you see stocks like Gamestop and Tesla that totally burns the short sellers. Given that I believe LFCR is a misunderstood situation and borrow fees are relatively high, the elevated short interest offers more reason to yield significant return should forbearance be granted and going concern notice removed.

Why are some people short this name?

Short thesis for this name is fairly straightforward. You have a company with business not matching the debt structure. The loans are current and they don‚Äôt have sufficient cash to meet all obligations. They just issued 38.75m in convertibles and even then they breached the covenants so the future looks bleak. Short!

On the other hand, the value of CDMO asset and high borrow rate make such thesis highly risky for the shorts and favorable for those looking at this name from the long side. What is this worth? We can look at other CDMO transactions for some guidance. Somewhat recent rumors of Catalent buyout sent the expectation to almost 20x EBITDA. Pantheon and Cook Pharma were both acquired for around 17 times EBITDA. If you apply a more conservative 15x multiple and subtract net debt, you are looking at a $14-15 stock. Apply 20x and you have a $20 stock.

What I see is a catalyst rich stock with next earnings right around the corner trading far below any reasonable transaction price (note: given that they released their Q2 only a couple of weeks ago Q3 could be delayed by few weeks). Should going concern be resolved by then, I believe people will begin speculating on potential buyout and shorts would be in deep trouble. Why would you be short should lenders agree to forbearance and acquirer could multiples of current price?

I think everyone knows there won't be robotaxis by the year 2028 2029 2030 and not obviously with their hardware and that they as of yet have demonstrated no lead or advantage. Unless anyone can demonstrate it which they haven't been able to? What gives you as tesla investors the confidence to own this company for the longterm? ALSO WHY DOESN'T ANYONE GIVE SPECIFIC DATES FOR WHEN IT WILL BE RELEASED TESLA ROBOTAXI?,04-04-2023
Do people understand there has been low interest rates that are effectively subsidized for 15 years? And that if they re align to reality which is 8 percent stocks look to have much different valuations?Why do people not seem to understand how an 8 percent interest rate would effect them?

"Tesla Finished Down -6.12% After Topping Estimates? How?**Tesla (TSLA) Finished The Trading Session Down -6.12%**

This Comes After Topping First-Quarter Estimates of Deliveries & Production

*How is this possible?*

\- Tesla Delivered 422,875 Vehicles, Beating 421,000 Estimate  
\- Tesla Produced 440,808 Cars, Beating 432,500 Estimate

*So, Why is the Stock Down?*

1. Wall Street is in disagreement of the expectation number. Some people are saying analyst expectations for deliveries were 430,000

But, this isn‚Äôt the main reason for Tesla‚Äôs Selloff‚Ä¶

2. Tesla should‚Äôve blown it out of the water. You can use either number for the analyst expectations, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Deliveries should‚Äôve been more. Barely beating delivery expectations after massive prices cuts to every model isn‚Äôt good.",04-03-2023
"What are your Thoughts on REITS?I started investing in one REIT called ellington financial in January, I really love the concept: own a company, hold it long term, make consistent, monthly cash. It feels more in line with actually owning a business vs. holding a stock like Tesla where you can only really make money if people think what you have is valueble.

Ellington is great because you get monthly dividends, 15 cents a share monthly, at 10-15$ a pop I have made a monthly income boost of $35 every single month so far. They seem to be lowish risk to, because people want to keep their dividend they are more inclined to stay in.

what do you guys like or dislike about REITS in general? What is your favorite?",03-15-2023
"Reallocating my portfolio and had a quick question.So originaly when I got into investing I purchased mostly growth etfs along with some choice stock like Tesla, this was about a year ago or so and everything is down, especially my growth etfs (volatility). I‚Äôve been doing a bunch of reasearch and realized that my dump money into random stocks/ indexes was unsustained and not very safe. I want to sell my indexes and stock and reinvest in indexes such as VTI that are more stable, my concern however is since I am currently down 16% all time with my growth etfs, and VTI is not down that much (since it‚Äôs not as volatile) I‚Äôll be loosing money since it‚Äôll be harder to regain the money I‚Äôve already lost. Some VTI wont go up as fast. Advice here? I really just want to reallocate and then forget it and add to it a few times a year periodically, but I don‚Äôt want to loose money.",03-13-2023
"Query - What has more impact on an index like NASDAQ-100?NASDAQ-100 closed at 12302.48 yesterday. The previous close was 12290.81. So it gained 11.67 points yesterday. Now percentage wise, the highest price gain was by Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH) 3.77% 1.11 Billion, but the increase in market capitalization was highest by Apple (AAPL) 1.85%  41.5 Billion. 

According to Wikipedia, NASDAQ-100 is ""modified capitalization-weighted index."" So am I right in my inference that though ENPH went up by 3.77%, this would have a much lesser impact on the index price than AAPL going up by 1.85%?  


Similarly, Dexcom (DXCM) was the biggest loser at -7.87% (-3.63 B), but Tesla was biggest loser as per market cap -2.01% ( -13.98 B).  


Smaller changes in bigger companies ( by market cap ) impacts the index more.  Would this be a correct assumption?",03-07-2023

"Investing in Mexico to capitalize on the return of manufacturing to North America?As the title says, Mexico with its low labor cost and available working population could be an ideal country in North America to become the manufacturing hub. On the heel of the upcoming announcement of the Tesla plant opening there, I wonder if we are going to see strong growth in the Mexican economy in the next decade.

"Has anyone heard that a portfolio balanced equally by sector will beat the S&P 500 over time?I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&P 500.

Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.

Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&P by 1.5% to 2% annually.

I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.",02-28-2023
"Chat Bots - Where is this technology headed and how to participate?This was an enlightening article for those interested in AI / Chat future.

[https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/](https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

It explains Microsoft's position relative to  OpenAI's Chat\_GPT and Google Bard.  It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed

Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.

As a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.

Circle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  ""And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.""

This is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

""\[NVIDIA\] has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the [computing power](https://techwireasia.com/2022/11/nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-to-build-the-most-powerful-ai-supercomputers/) of the world‚Äôs six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.""

Google and Microsoft may have ""the data"" to be leadership in AI.  But they haven't yet touched gloves while the opening bell is still reverberating on what is certain to be a 15 round cage match with a number of other 800 lb gorillas.   Nvidia on the other hand earned [$14.5B revenue](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q323.pdf) TTM on data center hardware -- primarily focused on AI training and inferencing.   So let google and msft and amazon and the rest slug it out -- it's impossible to know who will win.

"Exposure to carbon offset creditsI need the advice of the hive mind here.

My thesis is that carbon offset credits will appreciate in value. As time goes on, supply will go down and demand will go up.

Tesla selling their carbon credits and being able to claim it as revenue is setting a precedent that there is inherent value in carbon credits.

My question then becomes, independent of buying Tesla stock (I‚Äôm already overexposed there), how do I get direct exposure to carbon offset credits in a balanced portfolio?",02-10-2023

"Tech growth stock portfolio reallocation and diversification out of AppleI'm looking to create a portfolio with relatively safe tech growth stocks. I know that sounds like a bit of an oxymoron, but I'm looking to diversify out of my AAPL position. 77% of my portfolio is in the s&p 500. The rest is in AAPL.

I don't think AAPL is going anywhere, and they obviously have a loyal customer base and I think Apple TV is putting out some great content. I also love how vertically integrated they are. That being said, I think they've reached market saturation in most areas and it seems the pace of innovation has slowed. I'm thinking about selling 50%+ of my AAPL position because over the years it has grown to represent 23% of my portfolio and that just seems like too much for any one individual stock.

I'm considering divesting and reallocating into the following positions:

GOOGL
MSFT
AMZN
TSM
NVDA
META
TSLA

1. Google needs no introduction, but the stock is at super low p/e ratios and they continuously try (mostly unsuccessfully) to innovate across multiple sectors. Ads are obviously the bread and butter, but YouTube is the biggest threat to cable and streaming services. YouTube content is vast, high quality, and free!

2. Microsoft is also at pretty low p/e ratios. Azure is #2 cloud service. Gaming sector is growing and Sony/PlayStation is falling behind. Biggest thing for me is their investment into AI tech such as OpenAI (aka chatGPT). Overall they have diverse revenue streams and continue to innovate.

3. Amazon is not just ecommerce, but at absolute logistics giant. #1 cloud service. Decent streaming service. And they continuously reinvest into the company. They're also down more than others on this list in the past year.

4. Taiwanese Semiconductor is the world's leading chip manufacturer. P/e is low, but partly because of inflated chip prices. Biggest fear is Chinese government interference, but the $40 billion investment into the Arizona factory is encouraging.

5. Nvidia makes the most powerful chips in the world and has great partnerships with other leaders in tech. Also one of the leaders in AI technology. Downside is sky high p/e and it's down the least over the last year, so not the best value.

6. META for me is the hardest to evaluate. On one hand Facebook and Instagram are absolute social media giants that print money, but on the other hand I don't see nearly as much potential for growth. VR technology is cool, but it's a long way away from being mainstream. If that ever happens, there's no guarantee that META will be the ones to do it.

7. Tesla has obviously been hammered the most on this list, but I'm not sure it's totally warranted. Whatever Musk is doing at Twitter shouldn't really affect Tesla as much as it has. P/e ratio is back to reality somewhat and they continue to lead ev sales. Other manufacturers are struggling to catch up, it's happening, but much slower than anyone expected. If Tesla continues to keep it's foot on the gas and continues to improve it's qc and manufacturing processes, I see them remaining a leader in the ev field for years to come.


So Reddit, what do you think of my choices? And are there any other companies you think I missed and should look into? What percentage would you allocate into the above companies?",02-01-2023
"Will the EV market implode --consequences for investors?Many analysts have insisted that EVs are the future, that car manufacturers like GM, Ford, and Toyota need to do more to move into this space. But from what I see in the data, this entire sector could easily implode within 2-3 years, and simply doesn't have a future in the US. Why?

1. China produces close to 60% of all EV batteries--the US has virtually no domestic construction of these devices
2. The DRC accounts for 70% of all Cobalt mining, and that country is in the Chinese sphere-of-influence (they joined the belt-and-road initiative).
3. The US does not have any meaningful source of Colbalt, Lithium, or other elements needed for the manufacture of batteries. It depends entirely on imports

and then we have other factors:

1. EVs are scarce due to supply-line issues, manufacturing capacity, and logistics. There are very few available from any brand within 100 miles of where I live
2. The price of EVs is going up, not down, and dealerships are routinely slapping 15-20% markups over MSRP for these vehicles, outraging consumers
3. Outside of Tesla's charging network, other networks are plagued with reliability problems, and implementation has largely stalled.
4. The US electrical grid, in many areas, simply cannot support widespread EV adoption
5. With rising interest rates, recession looming, and a weak economy, the average consumer is in no position to shell out $55,000 - $80,000 for an EV

The math doesn't work anywhere here. A hostile power controls the import and manufacture of the components necessary to build these things, they are too expensive, and the grid won't support them.

Goin forward, I am going to look at shorting the stocks of any car manufacturer who is heavily investing in EVs, and the more money they throw at them, the more attractive a short they become.

This whole thing is going to implode with tens of billions in write-downs and widespread plant-closures. Am I wrong?",02-01-2023
tesla counts fsd revenue when the vehicle is delivered to the customer before that it is deferredIt seems shocking to me that so many people down vote the last post I did so I went and looked up the quarterly report. When tesla gets paid for the full fsd it is classifies as deferred revenue until it is delivered to the customer and then it counts as revenue. Do people understand this? My last post was basically the same thing but someone said they don't count revenue since it's deferred in the quarterly report and that as upvoted but if you actually read it which apparently no one does that's not the case. Do they are getting paid for a product that does not yet exist every single car company has a different strategy and its not even known if full fad is possible and no one here in the investing spot bats an eye? Like steven mark ryan cashes in with his patreon by telling gullible people that twsla will be worth 500 trillion dollars. Again Do you people understand that this technology has been promised by a man who only has stock in a company where if he didn't have full fad and record it as revenue that he would be massively in the red and hemorrhaging cash? Can no one see the similarities between tesla and enron????? Foes anyone see red flags here how even the people on this forum can't even read the quarterly report and then they cite profit margins that are again BASED ON A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS NEVER EXISTED AND HAS NOT BEEN SHOW TO BE ACHIEVABLE within the next decade? Every single oem has a different fsd strategy with different hardware etc. Again if someone promised a company that had a cure for lung cancer took cash today and then said ok well have it in 5 years and then every year after pushed back the deadline it would look awfully close to theranos or sbf.......anyone see the red flags heee?,02-01-2023
when people talk about tesla profitability and margins do they comprehend that they are counting fsd revenue?When people talk about profitability of tesla do they comprehend that they are factoring in full fsd and the technology at this point does not exist and that they are saying oh well well have it eventually anyways so we'll just register the profit now. But every single self driving company has a different strategy and no one has EVER built full fsd ever. And there are estimates that it will be in the 2040s before it's made. Do peoppe understand this? Cause essentially enron did the same thing with their accounting and that's what got them into trouble they counted Capex as profit. So a company can do all sorts of things with its accounting. Also it seems like the feds uber low interest rates which still have inflation at 6 or 7 percent which is 3x 3.5x their target seems to be interesting since that directly is a subsidy to growth stocks since rates are effectively negative 6 percent. Do tesla people understand this or are they just obsessed with a man's confident assertions whose whole net worth is in stock which he makes wild assertions about and has every incentive to do so.,02-01-2023
"Best way to invest bonus..Finance geniuses.

"Meta and Amazon Earnings: Time to Buy these Beaten-Down Tech Stocks?Breaking down Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Amazon (AMZN) ahead of their upcoming earnings results to see if investors might want to finally buy these beaten-down tech stocks.

**The Nasdaq climbed again through mid-afternoon trading on Friday, alongside the wider market as Wall Street continues to buy tech stocks**

>meta exclusive newsÔºö[https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment\_CA/comments/10an9pr/us\_stock\_marketdow\_futures\_steady\_after\_cpi\_eases/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopInvestment_CA/comments/10an9pr/us_stock_marketdow_futures_steady_after_cpi_eases/)

The market faced a big test mid-week and the bulls won out, for now, helping push the S&P 500 back above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages and the 4000 level.

More importantly, the Nasdaq jumped above its 200-day moving average for the first time in roughly a year. The market has bought up Tesla since its report, with the stock up 10% in back-to-back sessions. Microsoft stock has already erased its post-earnings pullback to extend its bullish start to 2023.

**The broadly upbeat start to the busy part of quarterly earnings season suggests that Wall Street thinks the earnings downturn is already mostly priced in. If the outlook for earnings does indeed hold up, the market could easily extend its recent bullishness.**

Plus, Wall Street feels the Fed is all but certain to roll out a 0.25% rate hike when its FOMC meeting concludes on February 1. Investors also appear convinced that a Fed pivot is on the horizon sooner than later.

This upbeat market backdrop likely has more and more investors wondering if it is time to dive back into the beaten-down tech titans, with Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) as the primary examples.

Meta, formerly Facebook, reports its Q4 FY22 financial results on February 1. The social media giant posted its second consecutive revenue drop in Q3, while its metaverse bet is off to a brutal start.

Meta‚Äôs growth days are no doubt over for now. But Wall Street spent a long time beating down the stock to help it more accurately reflect where Meta is in its lifecycle.

Meta's valuation is looking enticing and let‚Äôs not forget that it still reached 3.7 billion people a month across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp and nearly 3 billion daily. Meta stock has soared around 70% off its November lows, as investors start to dive back into the company for its ability to play a dominant role in a crucial area of the digital economy and venture into new areas with a balance sheet that‚Äôs still very impressive.

**Like Meta, Amazon stock has suffered a massive fall from grace as it too made big bets and faces a major slowdown from its days of huge growth.**

Amazon is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2022 results on February 2. AMZN, under the guidance of CEO Andy Jassy, is fighting to cut costs where it can as it aims to slim down a business that expands from e-commerce and cloud computing to an online pharmacy and movie and TV production.

Amazon‚Äôs growth is slowing, but it is still projected to expand its top line by roughly 9% in FY22 and Y23, which is no easy task for a firm set to pull in $510 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022. Amazon is still down over 40% from its peaks, including its nearly 25% climb in January.

I'm not suggesting he's going bankrupt or Tesla will disappear... but there was a time that people looked at the stock going to 7k, 10k, 15k. I think those are pipe dreams now, but what's the real, actual potential for the company in the next 5-10 years?

Am I overstating how much Musk drove that price vs. the actual company? It makes cool cars, that some feel have quality control issues.

"""Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany"" and the future of EV competitionI often see interesting articles posted in this sub but don't think this was posted before even though it's over a week old now. So many posts related to Tesla these days, I thought the results of this survey carried out by Der Spiegel would be interesting, in particular for Americans who maybe don't read European media. There are graphs/data on the article page itself.

*Musk Destroys Tesla Image in Germany* (14/12/2022)

https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/der-spiegel-survey-musk-destroys-tesla-image-in-germany-a-fcc01ca2-d5fe-4c57-ac11-b48a560771f7

Germans have a disastrous view of Tesla, with company founder Elon Musk's behavior hardly helping. Whether from a likeability or quality perspective, the Tesla brand is far behind its German competitors. 

Elon Musk, it would seem, is eager to drag his followers into the abyss of conspiracy theory credulity ‚Äì but is anyone taking the bait? The top dog of Tesla and Twitter has never been shy when it comes to polarizing statements, of course, but even by his standards, the last several days have been disturbing for his willingness to make right-wing positions his own. He went after the U.S. virologist Anthony Fauci, he has made light of people who want to determine their own sexual identity and he has generally declared war on ""woke."" During an appearance in San Francisco, Musk was booed for several minutes, and actor Billy Baldwin launched a trend with the hashtag #BoycottTesla.

In Germany, the calls for boycott were hardly necessary. That is the clear message of a survey conducted on behalf of DER SPIEGEL by the public opinion research institute Civey. Some 47 percent of the auto enthusiasts surveyed responded that Musk‚Äôs current behavior has had a ""clearly negative"" influence on their opinion of Tesla. An additional 16 percent said their reaction has been ""rather negative."" Only 3 percent said they have a ""rather positive"" impression of Musk‚Äôs recent behavior, and an additional 6 percent rated their impression as ""clearly positive."" The survey was carried out between Dec. 1 to 9, prior to Musk‚Äôs most recent outbursts.

In late October, after Musk took over control of Twitter, a number of public reactions already began indicating that the image of Tesla, the world‚Äôs leading electric car brand, was taking a beating. Alena Buyx, chair of the German Ethics Council, said at the time that she was no longer interested in buying a Tesla. ""It‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt do anymore,‚Äù she said.

In the U.S., the public opinion research company Morning Consult reported that Tesla‚Äôs popularity has suffered a nosedive primarily among supporters of the Democratic Party, which have traditionally dominated the e-car market. Since the beginning of the year, trust in the Tesla brand had been trending downward only slightly, says Morning Consult, but that Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter ""acted as a break in the dam."" Elon Musk‚Äôs polarizing personality, the consulting company found, is negatively impacting Tesla.

The new survey commissioned by DER SPIEGEL has now revealed the same impact on the company‚Äôs image in Germany as that seen in the U.S. ‚Äì just nine months after the carmaker opened up a new gigafactory outside of Berlin. And in contrast to the U.S., where Tesla seems poised to replace at least some of its disaffected supporters with new fans among pro-Trump Republicans, the same dynamic is nowhere to be seen in Germany. The broad rejection of Musk‚Äôs persona is apparent across all age, professional and educational groups in the country and it is independent of gender, region, family status, degree, religion and political affiliation.

The only exception is among those who proclaim to be supporters of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD), with only 35 percent of such respondents saying they had a negative reaction to Musk‚Äôs behavior. But even within this group, the negative reactions outweighed the positive (23 percent).

Even without explicit mention of Musk, only 9 percent of Germans said they find Tesla to be ""very"" or ""rather likeable."" Fully 69 percent, by contrast, said they found the manufacturer to be ""less"" or ""not at all likeable."" That makes Tesla by far the least popular company among large carmakers with production sites in Germany, a finding once again independent of political party preference.

The survey revealed more polarization when it comes to Germany‚Äôs tradition-rich luxury brands like Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi, which are generally viewed negatively on the left side of the political spectrum, but more positively on the right, with center-left Social Democrats also showing a weakness for Audi. Mass producers like Volkswagen, Opel and Ford, by contrast, tend to be more balanced, or they trigger very little reaction at all. Only Tesla is viewed negatively across all political parties. Musk‚Äôs company generates the highest likeability ratings among university students (27 percent), those under the age of 30 (22 percent), voters for the far-left Left Party (21 percent) and civil servants (17 percent). In all cases, though, Tesla supporters make up a clear minority.

Tesla also isn‚Äôt able to rely on its aura of being a technological leader. In response to the Civey question as to whether respondents view the vehicles produced by the different brands as high-quality products, only 21 percent answered positively when it came to Tesla.

That value puts Tesla at the very back of the pack, behind even Ford and Opel, both of which are also produced in Germany but which belong to foreign companies. Traditional German producers received top marks on the quality question. But Tesla has also been the focus of numerous negative reports  in the U.S. when it comes to quality and safety, in part because of the disastrous press its driver assistance system has received.

The survey does not allow for conclusions to be drawn on general attitudes in favor of or against electric vehicles. Tesla is the only manufacturer on the list to specialize entirely in e-autos and leads the segment both in Germany and elsewhere in the world when it comes to the number of vehicles registered. But other brands are offering more and more battery-powered vehicles. From January to November, 52,000 new Teslas were registered in Germany, according to the KBA, the German agency responsible for motorized vehicle registration. That represents around one-seventh of all fully electric vehicles in the country, with VW hot on its heels.",12-25-2022
"Are people reading too far into Tesla‚Äôs stock losses?Their share price has declined considerably over the past year. Part of that is obviously due to a general decline in equities, with the s&p500 down 20% this year. More of that is due to the general decline in tech stocks (which is what Tesla is generally regarded as), as the nasdaq is down 33% this year. But Tesla went even further than that, and is down 66% this year. 

The reasons people ascribe to this are generally either that the company is in trouble or that it‚Äôs because Elon isn‚Äôt there to right the ship (or both). But what if Tesla was just dramatically overpriced and it‚Äôs only now coming down to earth as first time retail investors who pumped money into stocks irrespective of fundamentals or even sound qualitative reasoning exit the market (which for the past 2 years held, by %, an unusually large proportion of Tesla‚Äôs shares)? What if, in a poor macro environment, people have just lost an appetite for risky assets? 

What if, and I know this is speculative, a stock that people were paying $1100 for each $1 in earnings for in 2020 *may* have been overpriced?

On top of all of that, I think some may have overestimated the size of Tesla‚Äôs moat and how difficult it would be for other car makers to catch up, and also may have failed to consider the strain increased competition would place on the vital and not exactly abundant supply of inputs necessary to make EVs. But I don‚Äôt think this point must necessarily be true to explain Tesla‚Äôs share price decline given what I said above. But I do think to some extent the current explanations for Tesla‚Äôs share price decline are the result of our tendency to look for a single person to blame for adverse outcomes - although I am not entirely condemning this view in this particular case as Elon being stretched this thin and spending so much time at twitter is objectively cause for some concern.",12-24-2022

Well, here we are with a major exchange filing for bankruptcy. I don't blame crypto but rather these kids trying to run companies that they do not know how to manage properly and more importantly surround themselves with smarter people in the room.

More important, during earnings call Elon admitted **""demand will be harder""** referring to the global recession he expects.

Also when asked about **deliveries** he again used the ""in transit"" argument which makes me wonder he already anticipates a Q4 miss.

Musk also said that 50% annual growth will be ""on average"" in other words he probably knows they won't meet that goal this year.

Overall would not be surprised if Tesla in coming weeks and months **will again miss alot of their targets once hard data comes in, esp. demand and delivery number updates.**

"Apollo Global Management Backing Out of Twitter Financing for Musk([Via Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apollo-global-management-backing-out-of-twitter-financing-for-musk-432SI-2905883)) 

According to Chibuike Oguh from Reuters, Apollo Global Management,  Inc. (APO) is backing out of Twitter, Inc. (TWTR) buyout financing for  Elon Musk. According to a person familiar with the matter, Apollo Global  Management, which was looking to provide $1 billion earlier this year  to Elon Musk for the deal, is no longer in talks with the billionaire.

Twitter shares rose more than 22% yesterday after Bloomberg reported  that Musk is proposing to acquire the company for the original offer  price of $54.20 per share.

Later, it was confirmed that Musk has sent Twitter a letter,  according to which he intends to proceed to close the Twitter  transaction on the original terms. For the last several months, Musk  tried to pull out of the buyout deal due to ongoing disagreement over  the number of spam and bot accounts on the site, prompting a lawsuit  regarding the takeover.

According to Reuters, Musk's changed decision over the deal made  Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) investors fear that the billionaire, who sold over $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier in the year to fund the deal,  was spreading himself too thin.

According to Dan Ives from Wedbush, Musk‚Äôs interest in closing the  deal would weigh on Tesla‚Äôs shares. ""We see lingering impacts from Musk  stock sales as a drag dissipating but the big worry is Musk juggling too  many balls at the same time,"" Ives said.

"Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This YearShare prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived‚Äîand an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans‚Äô behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve really been taking a beating,‚Äù said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uncomfortable.‚Äù 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market‚Äîincluding on Friday‚Äîonly to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven‚Äôt yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders‚Äô activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***‚ÄúThe frenzied, frothy behavior isn‚Äôt there,‚Äù said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. ‚ÄúBut that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.‚Äù ***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed‚Äôs interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

‚ÄúI fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,‚Äù he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters‚Äô college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

‚ÄúI started off feeling very greedy,‚Äù Mr. Tafarella said. ‚ÄúI thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.‚Äù

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed‚Äôs rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôd be silly to sell stocks,‚Äù Ms. de Weerdt said. ***‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they‚Äôre like in 30 years.‚Äù***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

>>Individuals‚Äô willingness to backstop markets throughout this year‚Äôs selloff demonstrates that the group‚Äîfor now‚Äîhas been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

"So what exactly is ""blue chip"" anyway?Recently I got myself sucked into an argument about what is or is not a ""blue chip"" stock. I am very much afraid that I may be wrong, so I wanted to poll everyone else and get their input. (And yes I know people can just look at my post history to see what side of the argument I am on, but I will try and present the choices objectively.)

**A blue chip stock is 'too big to fail' regardless of its age.**

* The theory is that it will be around for a long time in the future simply do to the fact of its enormous size and so much of the economy being dependent on it. The amount of time it has existed in the past is irrelevant. It could very well be a new company that haven't weathered any major bear markets yet. Examples would be Tesla or Facebook

**A blue chip stock is old regardless of its market cap.**

* Again, the theory is that this will be around a long time in the future. But the reason is because it has been around for a long time in the past. It has lived through bear market after bear market after bear market and just simply refuses to die. The overall size and market cap does not factor in. Examples would be Hormel Foods or Emerson Electric.

**A blue chip stock is just fucking expensive.**

* Here, the future longevity is beside the point. The word origin comes from a bit of folklore where a traded back in the 1920s was looking at ticker tape and made an offhand comment about realy giant numbers being shown in the print. In poker, the ""blue chips"" have the highest value so likewise the stocks that are ""blue chips"" have the largest per share price. Could be an old company or new. Could be a big company or small. Examples would be Berkshire.A or Chipotle.

"Musk asks court to reject Twitter‚Äôs request for ‚Äòwarp speed‚Äô trialRelated post on reddit: [**Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk‚Äôs Claims in Four Trial Days**](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vyt06k/twitter_says_it_can_beat_musks_claims_in_four/)

(Financial Times) -- Elon Musk says he needs more time to prepare for courtroom showdown over his attempt to back out of $44bn deal

Elon Musk has accused Twitter of an ‚Äúunjustifiable request to rush‚Äù the trial to determine whether he should be forced to complete a $44bn deal to buy the social media company.

Musk has suggested a trial start in February at the earliest, according to a court filing from his lawyers on Friday. That is several months later than the September timing being pushed for by Twitter in its lawsuit, which was filed in Delaware chancery court just days after Musk announced his intention to terminate the deal.

Lawyers representing the Tesla chief executive on Friday said in the 16-page response to Twitter‚Äôs lawsuit that the question of spam accounts on the network ‚Äî one of the primary reasons Musk has given for attempting to back out of the deal ‚Äî was ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù to the case and required lengthier investigation and ‚Äúsubstantial time for discovery‚Äù.

Musk‚Äôs lawyers described the proposed trial date, and the suggestion by Twitter it could be completed in four days, as being on a ‚Äúbreakneck schedule‚Äù.

‚ÄúTwitter‚Äôs sudden request for warp speed after two months of foot-dragging and obfuscation is its latest tactic to shroud the truth about spam accounts long enough to railroad defendants into closing,‚Äù the filing read.

A hearing on the matter is due to be held on Tuesday. Twitter declined to comment.

The social media company‚Äôs lawsuit accused Musk, the world‚Äôs richest man, of trying to back out of the deal on account of the rout in tech stocks that has hurt the value of Twitter and many of its peers. On July 8, when Musk announced his intention to back out of the deal worth $54.20 per share, the stock had fallen to $36.81.

In a case that has captivated the corporate world, Musk‚Äôs defence rests on his ability to convince the court that the issue of bots ‚Äî automated spam accounts ‚Äî on the platform is far greater than previously disclosed, representing a ‚Äúmaterial adverse effect‚Äù that would give him the ability to back out of the deal.

Musk has alleged Twitter had breached the merger agreement by not sharing sufficient information on fake accounts, a position reiterated in Friday‚Äôs filing, which again questioned the company‚Äôs long-stated estimate that bots made up less than 5 per cent of users.

Following a meeting between Musk and Twitter‚Äôs chief executive Parag Agrawal, ‚ÄúMusk was stunned to discover that Twitter‚Äôs process for identifying spam accounts relied on human reviewers to eyeball a minuscule portion of the userbase rather than utilising the company‚Äôs machine learning capabilities‚Äù, the filing said.

In its lawsuit, Twitter argued Musk had been well aware of the site‚Äôs issue with bots, pointing to tweets posted by Musk highlighting the matter prior to the deal.

The social network also accused Musk of breaching the terms of the merger agreement that demanded he not disparage the company, by highlighting his tweets that appeared to be goading Twitter‚Äôs leadership.

Addressing that claim, Musk‚Äôs filing accused Twitter of being unable to take a joke.

‚ÄúWith the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji,‚Äù the filing stated. ‚ÄúTwitter ignores that Musk is its second-largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board.‚Äù

"Twitter Says It Can Beat Musk‚Äôs Claims in Four Trial Days(Bloomberg) -- Twitter Inc. wants a lightning-quick trial to resolve its claim that billionaire Elon Musk wrongfully canceled his proposed $44 billion buyout of the social-media platform.

Lawyers for the San Francisco-based company say they need only four days in Delaware Chancery Court to prove that the world‚Äôs richest man should be forced to honor his agreement and pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company hopes to start the non-jury case on Sept. 19. Legal experts, however, predict the case will take about two weeks to try.

Unlike some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial, Delaware Chancery Court generally moves quicker. Chancery judges -- business law experts -- are known for being able to parse through the legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly and thoroughly than other US courts. Even complex business cases are often argued before a judge within six or seven months of being filed.

The Twitter buyout agreement specifies all legal disputes over the deal must be heard in Delaware, corporate home to more than half of U.S. public companies, including Twitter and Musk‚Äôs Tesla Inc..

Musk and his lawyers didn‚Äôt immediately return emails Tuesday seeking comment on both the suit and whether the case can be tried on Twitter‚Äôs schedule. Musk did issue a tweet Tuesday, saying: ‚ÄúOh the irony lol.‚Äù

A judge hasn‚Äôt yet been assigned to the case, but Chief Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick already has taken on investor suits over the teetering transaction. She may pick up Twitter‚Äôs suit as well. McCormick, a Delaware native, is a former legal-aid lawyer and graduate of Notre Dame Law School.

Twitter‚Äôs legal team argues it can easily show in less than a week of court time that Musk didn‚Äôt have legitimate grounds to nix the $54.20-per-share buyout. Twitter shares rose 8.1% to $36.83 at 3:01 p.m. Wednesday.

‚ÄúLitigation on the schedule Twitter proposes permits the parties and their experienced counsel ample time to assemble a trial record,‚Äù the lawyers wrote.

That would provide enough time for a judge to rule and have the Delaware Supreme Court review the ruling before the Oct. 24 closing date for the transaction, the lawyers said.

Charles Elson, a retired University of Delaware finance professor and former head of the school‚Äôs Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, says don‚Äôt bet on it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say a four-day trial is way more than optimistic,‚Äù Elson said Wednesday in an interview. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of water under the bridge on this deal and I‚Äôd say it going to take more like 10 days to try it.‚Äù

Last year, Musk traveled to Delaware for over challenge from Tesla investors to his more than $2 billion purchase of renewable-power provider SolarCity, a company he founded with his cousins. That case ate up 10 trial days. A judge ultimately concluded Musk didn‚Äôt force an overpriced SolarCity acquisition down the throats of his fellow Tesla directors.

"Ford‚Äôs MachE ‚Äì a examination of Tesla‚Äôs competition, with $TSLA implications
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up √† market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford‚Äôs unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition‚Äîfor several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto‚Äôs outlook writ large.** 

Ford‚Äôs ‚ÄòTesla Killer‚Äô is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‚ÄòStandard Range‚Äô RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‚ÄòExtended Range‚Äô (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines‚Ä¶the trucks 230 mile range‚Äôs real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‚Äòsupercharging‚Äô network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers‚Äîif you nix Tesla‚Äôs superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla‚Äôs over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices‚Äîthey have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can‚Äôt afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla‚Äôs cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn‚Äôt for Tesla‚Äôs record setting CAGR‚Äîwhich has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‚Äòbuffer‚Äô to decrease prices‚Äîin an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.",06-27-2022
"Tesla Looking Bullish Again!! Or Really??Tesla has formed a textbook double bottom pattern on the 1-day chart. A similar pattern was seen in the Tesla chart back in March 2022, which took the prices from the lows of $750 to the highs of more than $1150, a rise of more than 50% in less than 30 days.

This time around even if we get a rise of 50%, it'll form a lower high; a price target of $900 for Tesla looks to be on the cards.

This might be fuelled by a small rally in Nasdaq, which seems to get a bounce of 20-30% each time it tests the 200-week SMA, before breaking down eventually.

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

"Can Tesla bounce back quicklyTesla stock has been on a recent surge, especially after Trump's victory, with shares soaring from $246.23 to $487, a gain of nearly 97%. This rise has been largely driven by politics, particularly Musk's relationship with Trump. But the question is, how long will this premium due to politics last?



Tesla's future is also closely tied to Fully Self-Driving (FSD). If FSD is successfully rolled out and receives regulatory approval, Tesla could transform into an online car company, which would be a steady source of cash flow. However, regulatory issues and technology rollout remain challenges.



Although Tesla's stock price has risen sharply, analysts have mixed views on its outlook. Barclays maintains a ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù rating, believing that Tesla's stock price is out of touch with the company's fundamentals, with a price target of $270. CFRA, on the other hand, is more optimistic about Tesla, raising its price target to $560, believing that the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit will help Tesla expand its market share.



Going forward, Tesla could be at risk of a stock price correction, but if FSD goes smoothly and there are no regulatory hurdles, Tesla's long-term outlook remains bullish.

"NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New RallyNVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

https://preview.redd.it/ok73jyoabk7e1.png?width=4274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdb19d0e917d566e957a8693d65590b1adecf12

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

https://preview.redd.it/2kg8hm6dbk7e1.png?width=4276&format=png&auto=webp&s=5917df78a1bf3692f719dc35622f9ad823fab4ba

  
From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible. ",12-18-2024
"Hindenburg Omen Hey all!

Do you think the covid hangover allows things to keep going up longer than usual? Or are you in the ""this time is different crowd""?

Or are you like me and thinking a serious rebalancing is in order?

Does anyone know how many times the 2nd trigger of the Hindenburg Omen has been wrong? I'm not an expert, just a retail guy who loves data.

Robotaxi - China is way ahead of the States when it comes to Robotaxi and I feel Waymo already has the first movers advantage 

Model Q - it‚Äôs at least 3-4 years away, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have the turn around time that Chinese companies have 


Chinese EVs - while they won‚Äôt be allowed in USA but they have made their point, they are cheaper, equally good and in some cases better - Tesla has limited international growth potential now. Like I hear in India people are paying over 100% in tariffs to buy BYD from Singapore - they say it‚Äôs still good value for money

Elon will have to make some tall promises (again) in the next earnings call to justify this valuation - because he‚Äôs not selling as many cars and Robotaxi or model Q are still a distant future. ",12-12-2024

"QUBT is about to crash hardContext: Quantum computing is having its moment. It‚Äôs risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

QUBT is junk

Quantum Computing Inc. has many problems. Iceberg Research‚Äôs recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that QUBT has made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

QUBT lacks talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of QUBT‚Äôs employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), QUBT ranks incredibly poorly among it‚Äôs peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues QUBT comes out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. Maybe QUBT is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of QUBT‚Äôs ‚Äútalent‚Äù comes from the Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company‚Äôs Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company QPhoton with QUBT. Notably he is both a QUBT director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of $SAVA). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang ‚Äî Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven‚Äôs. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company‚Äôs chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English literature at Steven‚Äôs, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven‚Äôs. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven‚Äôs is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees as QUBT. QBTS has six fold. All have similar market cap. What‚Äôs driving value? We‚Äôve established that it‚Äôs not human capital. Iceberg‚Äôs research reveals it‚Äôs not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well? QUBT‚Äôs high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of QUBT is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ, ~30% for RGTI and ~47% for QBTS. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment in QUBT while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with QUBT. In fact no Wall Street analysts track QUBT. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

QUBT‚Äôs 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it‚Äôs junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why QUBT has done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

QUBT is literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you‚Äôre a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It‚Äôs a regard trap. 

It‚Äôs like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co.

"RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

What do you guys think?",11-06-2024
"Why Donald Trump‚Äôs Return Could Boost Demand for Robots ‚Äì A Long-Term Investment OpportunityHey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there‚Äôs more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap‚Äîand robots could be the answer.

That‚Äôs where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let‚Äôs talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they‚Äôve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we‚Äôre talking about. RR‚Äôs service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they‚Äôre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn‚Äôt just conceptual‚Äîit‚Äôs been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there‚Äôs Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we‚Äôre after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",11-06-2024
"Educate me about stock So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it).

"Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental creditsTesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts‚Äô forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla‚Äôs growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

"Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google‚Äôs self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that‚Äôs over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google‚Äôs search business is under threat, it‚Äôs important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing *really* good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually.

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter
Tesla‚Äôs stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla‚Äôs growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.

In the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla‚Äôs lead remains substantial.

Tesla‚Äôs 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.

Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company‚Äôs upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.

"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and AtlantaUber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips‚Äîexclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo‚Äôs co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

The competition in the self-driving space is heating up, and Uber's latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

"Opportunity In OracleI‚Äôve been hearing how oracle expects 9% revenue growth for FY 25 they also said for Q3 and Q4 24 they had signed their largest contracts to date. 

I‚Äôve also heard examples of how‚Äôd they‚Äôd apply their tech. One example tied to the medical industry. Say a doctor wanted to pull up past CT scans, MRIs, or other tests when meeting with a patient they can voice request these from Oracles database. Hospital,  physician offices, and dentists offices at least in my area always feel like they have some of the most outdated data systems I‚Äôve ever seen. Whether or not hospital managers feel like forking out money to upgrade is another question, but if they were to upgrade to something this feels like it would actually improve efficiency.

I‚Äôve heard from Oracle execs before around integration of AI in automating some data pulls. It seems like something that‚Äôs been on their radar for years. To me this seems like a value offering of their DBMS and their cloud Services. 

I‚Äôm a little skeptical on near term feasibility of the more complex things Oracle claims on automated analyses. In practice there‚Äôs so much nuance to data that I wouldn‚Äôt currently trust this to handle complex questions that require strategic thinking and business knowledge. So personally I don‚Äôt buy claims around complex analyses anytime soon. 

One other thing was Oracle is also quite literally designing data centers that would be powered by SMRs in addition to expanding their existing data center footprints. SMRs historically have been quite expensive to install, but curious to see if there are long term cost savings by doing this. 

It seems like they have a feasible vision for how the products can be used everyday and commercialized. On one hand you have companies like Tesla promising C-3PO and on the other hand companies like Oracle are promising something that feels much closer and real, with practical use cases.

What are other things you think might drive value or detract value to Oracle in the future. Do you think it‚Äôs overvalued (if so why?)? 

Also, did anyone have any interesting reads around this to share? Trying to learn more about their business plan. ",09-12-2024

"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robotsRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since MayWaymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

"Tesla Stops Taking Orders For Its Least Expensive Cybertruck ($61K), Cheapest Cybertruck Now Costs $99,990 Tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry-level Cybertruck, which was originally priced at $61,000, leaving the $100,000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. This move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by CEO Elon Musk, who in 2019 projected that the Cybertruck would cost around $40,000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. Now, the least expensive model available is the dual-motor Foundation series, which is priced at $99,990 and offers a 318-mile range. This model is available for delivery as soon as this month, while the higher-end $119,990 tri-motor Cyberbeast, which has a 301-mile range, is expected to be delivered starting in October.

Despite Musk's earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations, some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected, especially for the higher-priced models. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, noted that this latest move ""shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks,"" particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option.

Tesla's shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability, even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. The Cybertruck, with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the ""Blade Runner"" movie and its stainless-steel body, has certainly captured the imagination of many, but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some.

Sales figures show that Tesla sold nearly 4,800 Cybertrucks in July, marking its best month yet and making it the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. priced over $100,000. However, maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. A spokesperson for Cox Automotive commented that while Tesla has sold more than 16,000 units so far, ""sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge,"" reflecting the potential difficulty Tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup.

The Cybertruck‚Äôs journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges, with deliveries only beginning in November 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp-up. With the latest pricing strategy, Tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high-end models to carry the day, but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen.

"Possible Bullish Thesis on HertzI know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

What are your thoughts?  
Do you see value in this thesis?  
Do you have a strong counter argument?

Looking forward to your thoughts. Thanks!",08-06-2024

"How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investmentüí∏Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes.

If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more.

However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well.

One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle...

https://preview.redd.it/lyt5r3kmn3cd1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe179e72d777caf49e6d8c0e66ec800f6f39d34a

Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors?

Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow.

This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.

James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get.

Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport.

I believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does).

I've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla.

Tesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too...

https://preview.redd.it/pnc5gnmsn3cd1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba5c2e8b2be1dcdd27e20bc81f604e2f627b7beb

When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government.

Seeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now.

# Positive Factors

The main factor is Volkswagen's recent $5B investment, which has significantly extended the liquidity runway.

**Additional key considerations:**

1. Strong balance sheet with $7.9B cash/investments as of Q1 2024
2. New factory in progress + tax incentives for existing facility
3. Positive sentiment around trucks and vans, with super loyal fanbase
4. R&D in Serbia, reducing costs
5. Shifting to base platform + add-ons model
6. New R2 model has more reservations than total yearly production
7. Potential for expanded partnerships.
8. Expected gross profit by year-end could boost stock to $20-25 range

# Challenges

Declining cash balance and high cash burn rate during production ramp-up since FY 2022 is a main risk.

Competition from established automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers is important to consider as the market becomes increasingly competitive.

# Technical Analysis

[Chart and analysis by takeprofit.com\/@mustermann84](https://preview.redd.it/7nc6yyt3e59d1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc8530008238aa27c0566f25c1875b06e5b5bded)

* Weekly chart indicates a possible trend reversal (depicted as a ""Black Swan"" pattern resembling a head and shoulders formation)
* Possible interim price targets in identified cluster zones
* MACD indicates a potential long-term reversal 

# Conclusion

Rivian's profile has improved significantly, addressing previous concerns. The Volkswagen investment is a game-changer for risk mitigation. However, cash burn remains a concern, with negative free cash flow of $1.5B in Q1 2024. The new investment extends the runway to 8-9 quarters, reducing immediate financial pressure.

I will closely monitor Rivian's performance and how it handles challenges, especially from Chinese rivals.

What are your thoughts on RIVN? Are you buying, holding, or staying away?",06-27-2024
"Rivian / The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern.# Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive?

# The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation.

¬†There is a so-called Black Swan pattern, which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal.¬†The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements.

* The smaller Fibonacci is the so-called conservative retracement.
* ¬†The longer-term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement.

For the technical analyst, the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible (interim) price targets. In this context, the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy, structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart.¬†

How do you view the merger, and do you see a realistic chance for VW to assert itself against BYD and Tesla with this collaboration? The chart at least offers a perspective on a fruitful collaboration.",06-27-2024

"VOO and chill but can you really not make smart moves?Hello, 21 year old here

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right? Could people, in tech, working for cisco or nokia, really not see the future of aapl and msft back in the early 2000s? Was it really that blinding? ",06-13-2024
"Tesla shareholders voting yes for Musk's $56 billion pay package, CEO tweets",06-13-2024
"Fear that I've already missed out (the opposite of FOMO)?I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think ""heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then, rather than buying in with that realization, I talk myself out of it. ""How much more can it really go up?"" I don't know... Examples: Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I've since watch both explode and its like ""damn! why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies?"" Those are the most obvious misses I've made.

I'm curious how you determine when you've missed your opportunity. I'm not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don't care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn't think most companies were a safe long-term bet. But, there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn't have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity, I'm like ""is now the best time to buy? Its already doubled since I was ready to enter."" 

I'm currently don't have much liquidity so I'm not buying. But, by the end of the year, I should have $20-30k freed up. And, if some of the stocks I'm currently interested in go up, I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere ""safer."" Besides the argument that over an x number of years, almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you've missed out.",06-12-2024

Tesla shareholder sues Musk for alleged $7.5 billion insider trading,06-02-2024
The Growth of Top Tech Stocks ( 5-yr period),05-30-2024
"Are You Proud of the Companies You Invest In?Hey!

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",05-26-2024

- Grouping includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia.
- The group has dropped 8% from its April peak, having surged 117% from Jan. 2023 lows.
- Nvidia fell 10% as AI stocks retreated.
- Earnings per share growth expected to slow to 16% from 42%.
- COVID-19 pandemic caused an asynchronous earnings cycle.
- Deceleration in large cap tech and acceleration in mid cap tech may lead to a reversal in stock leadership.
- Non-tech companies expected to see earnings shift from a 3% fall in Q1 to a 19% fall in Q1 2025.
- Shift may be disruptive in the short term, but UBS reiterates S&P 500 target of 5,400 for end of year, citing positive fundamentals and a robust economy.

Nearing the January 2023 gap.

Since Tesla announced a 10% global workforce reduction on April 15th, more challenges have arisen. 

According to reports, a key Tesla supplier disclosed a 30% decrease in supply to the company. Tesla's Shanghai factory, the supplier's biggest customer, has consistently placed stable orders in the past year. However, Tesla's sudden decrease in order volume has significantly affected the supplier, indicating an implementation of substantial production cuts.

Tesla's China wholesale volume fell 4% YoY to 220.9k units in Q1 2024.

"BYD Company (Chinese Stock) 

**BYD Company Stock (Chinese Stock)**

**My Thesis:**

BYD is unknown, undervalued and currently growing at a very aggressive rate and has a lot of future potential to do well.

In 2023 Q4, BYD overtook Tesla in the number of EV sales (526000 BYD to 484000 Tesla) meaning it became the number one EV player in the market. At the rate BYD is growing at, they will be a dominant force in the market in the years to come when cars transition to electric.

However there are many risks associated with a new, upcoming car brand in the industry of automotives particularly as it is a Chinese company. 

**Pros of BYD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4uygiuo47mc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b5e265ae4b72a5f6ee754ca9adafef3825dca7

**BYD** as a whole is growing at a very aggressive rate from almost doubling its revenue from 2021 to 2022. As it looks to expand into new horizons, there is more potential for growth as it taps into Europe, Southeast Asia, Mexico and Brazil where they have only begun rolling out their EVs in 2022/2023.

Strong balance sheet

Debt (Current 11,618 + Long Term 10,211) =  21,829 Billion CNY

From 2020 - 2022 BYD has been free cash flow positive.

BYD is undervalued compared to Tesla (28/2/24) at time of writing

**BYD Ratios**

PS 0.92

PB 4.09

P/E 18.64

EV/EBITDA 12.55

**Tesla Ratios**

PS 6.56

PB 10.14

P/E 46.9 

EV/EBITDA 41.24 

Vertical Integration allows BYD to keep EVs at an affordable price to help maximize its sales. Instead of purchasing parts/components from external companies, BYD makes most of its components by itself e.g. batteries, IGBT transistors (2 of the most expensive parts) and electronic components. The only parts BYD reported that they don‚Äôt make are the windows and tires.

BYD is heavily supported by the Chinese government through subsidies to help lower costs for them which allows BYD cars to be sold at a very affordable cost for consumers particularly in the Asian markets.

**Challenges + Risks** 

BYD is relatively unknown in the automobile industry and tapping into developed markets like Germany, Japan and America will be very difficult. There will be challenges in convincing consumers to transition from well-known brands with much longer history such as Toyota and Volkswagen etc... This is particularly true with the skepticism surrounding EVs and Chinese companies in general.

BYD experienced this issue when they tried to sell their electric bus fleets in North America back in 2015. However, through successful marketing and branding strategies BYD managed to win consumers and now 50% of electric buses are from BYD. There is a big question whether BYD is able to market strategically and convince the public of its electric cars.

Heavy tariffs placed on BYD in Europe/America will severely cut BYD‚Äôs margins where we are seeing 25% tariffs in the likes of America combined with the difficulty of marketing their EVs to the public. This is due to the ‚Äúunfair playing advantages‚Äù BYD has had from Chinese government subsidies. [EU anti-subsidy probe into electric vehicle imports from China | Think Tank | European Parliament (europa.eu)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2023)754553#:~:text=On%204%20October%202023%2C%20the,vehicles%20(BEVs)%20from%20China.) There is also a question of what will happen in the future if the Chinese government reduces the subsidies it is giving to BYD.

Currently most of BYD‚Äôs revenue is from China so there are risks associated with how the Chinese economy does. But BYD is looking to diversify by expanding globally as mentioned previously.

One of the biggest risks is the ‚ÄúChina Risk‚Äù. We have seen crackdowns in large Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent due to their market dominance, unfair competition and fraudulent practices. As a result we have seen Chinese stocks plummeting down and losing a lot of value in recent years. Whether BYD will be a target of this when they grow further in the future is a red flag for many investors.

There has been a recent announcement by Biden that Chinese EVs will be banned in America due to safety issues and it is possible that European countries may follow in the footsteps of America and the bans could spread to the developed Western countries (Australia, Canada, Western Europe) etc. This is certainly a big risk to BYD's opportunity to expand into the Western markets as they have just recently set up new bases in the likes of Germany and Australia. Future revenues will take a big hit and earnings potentials will be seriously limited if this is the case. The geopolitical tensions between the West and China is a major risk factor we have to account for.

**Summary**

In conclusion, BYD presents an interesting investment opportunity. The company has demonstrated impressive growth, overtaking Tesla in EV sales and expanding into new markets. Its strong balance sheet, positive free cash flow, and undervaluation compared to Tesla suggest potential for significant upside. Vertical integration and government subsidies have allowed BYD to keep prices competitive and penetrate markets effectively. While there are challenges, such as tapping into developed markets and navigating tariffs, BYD has shown resilience and adaptability in the past. The company's efforts to diversify its revenue streams and expand globally mitigate risks associated with its reliance on the Chinese market. Recent announcements of potential bans in Western countries could pose a significant threat to BYD‚Äôs expansion plans. While the ""China Risk"" is a concern, BYD's track record and strategic positioning make it a promising stock for investors looking to capitalize on the growing EV market and the transition to electric vehicles particularly in the developing countries.

**My Take:**

Yes we have seen the large crackdown on big tech stocks in China. However, BYD works closely with the government and is supported through subsidies, incentives and government support so it is in BYD's interest to follow CCP's policies and regulations. China recognizes that they are facing a global warming crisis and are transitioning to ""clean up"" their country through switching to EVs so it is in the CCP's interest to work with BYD. The world is larger than America/Europe and there is a huge market in the developing nations. I recognize that there are many risks in investing in BYD but for the valuation it is currently at, I believe it is undervalued and there is significant potential in the years to come. ",03-03-2024

"[OC] The case for Peloton (PTON) 3 points to consider:&#x200B;

There is no doubt that Peloton stock has had a roller coaster ride since 2020.

When Peloton IPO'd in 2019, it was priced around $25-$30 a share.  When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.

This huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  ""sunk cost fallacy"" trap. Which states: ""It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.""  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The ""sunk cost fallacy"" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.

**Points to consider:**

It is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as ""turning the corner"", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.

1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the ""treadmill for the rich"" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new ""video game"" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun).
2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the ""household"" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is
3. **""Great product not a great stock""** \- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow ""separate"" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks ""great""., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant ""moats"" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.

I would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.

Overall, #expectations from #analysts were narrowly missed, yet the long-term perspective for #Tesla remains exceptionally attractive. AI and robotics will increasingly come into focus.

#Sales
Vehicle deliveries increased from 405,278 to 484,507, a 20% rise from Q4-2022 to Q4-2023. Elon Musk hinted in the conference call that Tesla's FY24 Volume growth ""may be notably lower.""

#Revenue
Increased from $24.32 bn. to $25.2 bn. - a moderate growth of 3.6%. Despite increased deliveries, lower prices per vehicle & an unfavorable model mix (more lower-priced models) dampened the revenue increase.

#Margin
Declined from 16% to 8.2% - here the price reductions & higher production costs due to the Cybertruck are evident. Operating income fell from $3.89 bn. to $2.06 bn. Another positive note is the increase in EBIT margin compared to Q3-2023 at 7.6% - the bottom has been passed!

#EPS (Adjusted)
This fell from $1.19 to $0.71, a 40% decrease. Despite a one-time tax benefit of $1.56 per share (or $5.9 bn.), the decline in profitability metrics could not be offset.

#FreeCashflow & #Cash
Jumped from $1.42 bn. to $2.06 bn. (+45%). As a result, the cash balance increased from $22.2 bn. to $29.1 bn. (+31%). This demonstrates Tesla's ability to efficiently generate and utilize capital - even in challenging times!

Despite the solid figures, the guidance for 2024 remains cautious. Expected lower growth rates in vehicle volume could cool growth, while the focus is on the next generation of vehicles (Model 2/A in 2025 for $25,000).",01-25-2024
"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541

Data Sources:

* SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã
* SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)

**Key Observations:**

* Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA.
* Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY.
* Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.

It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.

I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:

1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market.
2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy.
3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results.
4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy.
5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform.
6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.

It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Nikola (NKLA) thoughts?The expert evaluation is technically Hold, understandably so.  To me it looks like a cheap penny stock to maybe explode in a few years. Company was worth 80$ per share in 2020, although based on lies the company told their investors, which he‚Äôs doing 4 year time in prison for now.  But to see the gains like that, and where they‚Äôre at now, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to throw 5 grand at it now .80cents per share, to potentially be  $40,000 in a few year if they get back to where they were ? 

The company did develop and sell 35 hydrogen powered electric heavy trucks last year, the first of their rollout.  Those trucks do currently have a recall that they‚Äôre fixing. 

Given the scandal years ago , and the mechanical troubles now I definitely feel the apprehension, but the company is resilient and considered by some to be in a hiccups stage, potentially rising to a Tesla of the workforce so to speak someday.

"Tesla: How about its inventory level?A lot of posts are talking about Tesla's production and deliveries in 2023, thus would like to look into the numbers from another perspective.

# INVENTORY

https://preview.redd.it/omsupf0ar1ac1.jpg?width=424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2309e6cfc9f615286d06e98ab7bb200c91aa9c13

When we look at the production and deliveries numbers between 2021 and 2023, it is not difficult to identify that the aggregate production is larger than the aggregate deliveries \[note: -5,750 for FY2021, +55,760 for FY2022 and +37,404 for FY2023\].

With the fierce competition observed in the market (lead to price slash and hence decline in gross profit margin) as well as the loss of tax credit / green benefits in 2024 (lead to possible lower demand for some of its core products), wonder if inventory will become a problem for the company in future.

The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)

&#x200B;

The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.

&#x200B;

The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.

&#x200B;

Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.

&#x200B;

Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.

&#x200B;

Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.

&#x200B;

The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.

&#x200B;

SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.

&#x200B;

Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.

&#x200B;

See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?

&#x200B;

Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:

&#x200B;

The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",12-27-2023

"P/E ratio for growth stocksShould you use the median P/E ratio (last 5years) of growth stocks to value them? I know that P/E ratio above 30- 35 are difficult to keep over long period of times, but many growth stocks have median P/E ratios than exceed 35 by a lot. So it's ok to suppose that a growth stock will match its median P/E ratio again or should I use a lower p/ e ratio for the estimates(maybe the median P/E ratio for companies in the same industry? )
In general, how long can growth stocks keep a high P/E ratio?
As an example I have Tesla. Right now is P/E ratio is 68. And its median P/E ratio last years was 179. So will Tesla have a similar P/E (especially if they grow as analyst expect) or which p/ e ratio would you use for the next 3 years at least 

I hope I can be understood, I am still new in investing, but there are some stuff that still confuse me. If you could help me, I would appreciate a lot :)

"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming yearSo I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",07-17-2023

&#x200B;

**1)** **Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**

Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.

**2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**

Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.

**3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**

As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.

**4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**

Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.

"What Am I Missing?Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). 

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...

"TSLA: Cybertruck‚Äôs About to Nuke Boomer AutoAlright degens I've been crunching some numbers that are gonna make you twitch. People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.

I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.

The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.

We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.

I smell blood, and I think you do too.

Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.

Even with that lowball number, Tesla‚Äôs got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That‚Äôs like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.

Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: üñï

These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.

So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts‚Äô expectations out of the water.

tl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.

"Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions 

Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company‚Äôs record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla‚Äôs NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM‚Äôs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.

Nonetheless, it hasn‚Äôt all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck‚Äôs capabilities.

Preproduction ‚Äúalpha‚Äù versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still ‚Äúastounded‚Äù that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.",06-14-2023

"What's going on with Rivian?Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the company‚Äôs share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?

One bright spot has been the company‚Äôs increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivian‚Äôs future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% increase. Also, Rivian executives stressed their plans for profitability, which sent stock prices soaring.¬†

However, some larger issues still remain. Rivian is being forced to compete not only with rival Tesla, but other legacy automakers jumping into the EV race such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company. If Rivian doesn‚Äôt establish a strong foothold in the electric vehicle market soon, it may lose its opportunity to establish a presence in this growing market.¬†

I believe Rivian is an all-or-nothing play. Investing in the stock is extremely risky. However, the stock is poised for explosive returns if the company can work out its financial issues and deliver quality products to millions of customers that demand them. Currently, the company sits on $12 billion in cash and just shy of $3 billion in debt. According to FactSet, the target price for Rivian Automotive is $23.95, which reflects positive sentiment for the company even as it struggles.",06-06-2023
"regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans, sends valuation to $5bnElon Musk's company, Neuralink, which is developing technology to implant chips in human brains, is now valued at around $5 billion.

This valuation increase is due to some investors purchasing stock and the recent U.S. regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans.

The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.

Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.

After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.

**why is this important?**

1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested.
2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology.
4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink.
5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.

"Anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies via asset management companies?Hey lads! I‚Äôm sure everyone by now is pretty aware of the AI and robotics space as it‚Äôs literally all over the place right now. People like Elon Musk have been talking about it a lot recently and Tesla also just put out their newest iteration of their bots on LinkedIn which was pretty cool to see. I‚Äôve always been amazed at how robots are able to do tasks in the same capacity we do so seeing it come to fruition is pretty insane to me.

I always do my best to keep up with news in the space to see if there‚Äôs any cool advancements or new jobs that these robots are taking on. That being said I saw today that ‚ÄúUnited Drug‚Äù who is one of Ireland‚Äôs largest pharmaceutical distributors has just brought in a whole squad of autonomous robots..and when I say squad I mean 21 robots lmao. That‚Äôs almost enough for a soccer match lol. The company partnered with LocusBots to make this happen which I found pretty cool because I had heard about them working with DHL and UPS before. Apparently these robots are able to navigate autonomously through the warehouse and assist the human staff (thought I‚Äôd add the human part on just incase lol) with handling orders. It‚Äôs suppose to increase overall productivity of the warehouse, which I feel like is going to be the case when you add in robotics in any capacity to somewhere. I wonder if robots are eventually going to eliminate a whole bunch of jobs in the near future.. What yall think? I feel like i can easily see robots operating a warehouse.

After reading through the article I wanted to check out LocusBots a bunch more and invest in them. Cause if they are making big splashes like this in major companies around the world I want to be in on them. It was annoying to find out that they‚Äôre a private company lol

I did however come across Stack Capital while doing my search into investing into Locus. From what I gathered Stack Capital invests in equity, debt, and/or other securities of growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I seen that in their portfolio they had already invested $8m into LocusBots back in 2022 so this could potentially be a good way to indirectly invest in them right? From the looks of it they have a pretty solid management team with a whole bunch of experience so I‚Äôm not super worried about their judgement when it comes to portfolio management.

Does anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies this way? I‚Äôve personally never done it so I‚Äôm not 100% sure on it. I really love the look of Locus so I would really love to get some insight into companies like Stack and if they‚Äôre a good shout or not.",05-30-2023

"4 rental properties & home paid off, no mortgages/loans. 30 years old. What should I invest in with an additional $100k? (Advice Needed)**Hi team.**

**I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.

**My current investments are the following:**

* 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.)
* My home (Paid off).
* 2 Stocks (NIO & Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share.
* My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).

I have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).

My monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).

I know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.

So, I've heard the term ""mutual funds"" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms ""HYSA and Money market funds"". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).

So now, I plan to change how I manage my money.

**What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.

**What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account.
3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF).
4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.

So, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.

**My questions are:**

1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy?
2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.

P.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.

I appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.",05-28-2023

"Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock. 

## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.

The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.

It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.

Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.

Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.

 

## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance

During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:

* Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year;
* Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.

Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.

Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.

While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS).¬†

 By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.

Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss. ¬†

Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.

 

## Didn't see this coming

Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.

Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile.¬†

While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business.¬†

 

## Is the stock a buy?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejok5t214q0b1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=07eb3d2aa3cc50571a3de7cb8c4eb82190d7c22e

 

In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify.¬†

After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.

Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.

Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.¬†¬†

I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.",05-19-2023

The general strategy on this portfolio are broken down to 3 parts.  
  
1. Core Holding - This portfolio is mainly in a tax advantage account. This account will focus more on longer term outlook. All the distribution will be funnel in to a passive index such as VFV (SP500) or XQQ (Nasdaq). The distribution in an extreme emergency can be used for living expense. The plan here is that if imagine starting at 0 and invest the amount provided by this account for 30 years with 6% real return, the portfolio should be worth 1.5m and we can just live off that if all else fails.   
  
2. Margin Fixed income - This portfolio is in my margin account. I made a plunge in Q3 last year to purchased a lot of preferred shares at the peak (or what I thought was the peak) of interest rates. My assumption is that PS should move similar to bond and peak interest rates should somewhat indicate bottom of these PS prices. As interest decrease, or even just an market sentiment of rate decreasing should gradually move these shares price up. Also, as rate decrease, margin rate should also follow suit.  
  
As the distribution is more secured than common shares dividends, I felt a bit more comfortable going in with some margin. The distribution for this portfolio is mainly used for paying down margin, but can be used as a living expense if needed.  
  
Why Brookfield? I specifically picked up mostly BPO which is property side of Brookfield. This includes a lot of offices building related assets which I feel was priced down unreasonably at the time with market believing that WFH is here to stay. These PS at the time was trading at 40$ of issued price, yielding over 12-15% at the time. Majority of them are rate resets type.  
  
The margin should be paid down in around 4-5 years; however, as the rate bottomed out or the shares prices are close to issued price I may off load these to pay down margin and redistributed to equity based funds.  
  
3. Living Expense - This portfolio is mainly focused on broader market covered call etf mainly SP500 and Nasdaq with an exception of YTSL which only hold tesla. All the distribution from this portfolio is going toward living expense. Anything saved will be moved to emergency cash pile to later be reinvest or spend accordingly  
  
So imagine the whole portfolio distribution to be like your work income. 25% of the income (core) is going toward saving for the future, 25% (margin) going toward paying down debt which is margin, and 50% (living) is going toward living expense.  
  
---  
I also have 6-12 months emergency funds. In the case that market tanked hard, we will switch to living off these while reinvest the distribution. As economic uncertainty is looming and I'm just taking a plunge into this for the first time, the first few months we might be extra careful with spending and see where to go from then.  
  
Potential risk  
Aside from concentration risk in Brookfield, tesla and Nvdia that can add volatility. The other area of risk I can see is that I'm extracting 12% of distribution entirely from LE portfolio, this could proved shaky in the long term. My vision here is that in a year or 2 as rate decreases, I can off load preferred shares portion and move it to equity which will help pad the LE portfolio and bring down the spend rate on LE portfolio.   
  
The worst worst case scenario that I'm not fully prepared for would be the event where simultaneously, market crashed and Brookfield also get massive hit to the point where liquidation is in question where bonds and PS are priced down significantly - I then get margin called and liquidated.  
  
---  
  
Currently, me and my partner are burned out from our work. We have no other income sources, so we are living off this portfolio and plan to be for a long while. Generally we do not have lavish life style, so our projected expense should be covered by the LE portion of the portfolio. but if extra expense comes up we can drawdown the cash pile or from Margin portfolio. I've been a long time lurker in this sub and I thought I'd document my journey.

"I want to increase my dividend yield. Any advice is welcomed.Hi everyone, I have been following the sub for a while and this is my first post.

I'm M26, **European investor**, which means I have limited access to US ETFs. I use IBKR.

I have started investing in growth assets at the end of 2019 (right before the covid crash, learned things the hard way).

I have slowly built my portfolio (image attached) over the years and I never really cared much about dividends. I also have around 40k $ in crypto.

However, recently, I decided to calculate my monthly dividend yield and it turns out I get around 100$ monthly in dividends. So now I really wanna start setting goals and hopefully reach first **500$ monthly** and later increase my goal.

I manage to save and invest 2000$ monthly. I was thinking about adding $VHYL to my portfolio.

Please help me build a more dividend aggressive strategy. I am not looking for a ready plan, but simply I'd like first to hear your opinions and feedback on my portfolio and then what you would do/change and how you would allocate the 2000$ monthly. Also, what apps or websites should I check out for tracking my dividends?

Thanks.

"ETFs are the wrong way to invest in BDCsGiven the recent outperformance of BDCs it is no wonder that interest is picking up.

So it is no surprise that more often than not when people discuss their holding MAIN shows up in the list.

Another trend that I have noticed is that people tend to bring over investment approaches that they are accustomed to from common equity stocks and attempt to apply it to to close ended investment funds like BDCs.

What little data that I bothered to Google seems to confirm my suspicion as BIZD (which is the de-facto only ETF in the space) has seen an uptick in its AUM.

https://preview.redd.it/msvd31kb1xoc1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=059e8a1d6545a5b1cd957a6c4cb3845e100cce30

Fund flows from the last year also show a growing interest.

https://preview.redd.it/cm7xdaeg1xoc1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15e02762a699260f70b7da28a859b707a5a78ed

So now to my point - ETFs are the wrong way to invest in BDCs (and more broadly CEFs) for the following reasons:

A BDC is not a single holding in the regular sense that a company like Tesla is a single company, they are by themselves a diversified fund of investments just like an ETF is a diversified fund of investments.  
A picture is worth a thousand words, so here is a graphic from MAIN's recent investor presentation:  


https://preview.redd.it/hx9n38k33xoc1.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&s=0560d574d4e5f7b5c6490f0d586f028c05b205e4

So buying a BDC ETF is like buying an ETF of ETFs, not to mention that you will be paying fees to the ETF and fees to the individual BDCs held within it.

Another reason to avoid CEF ETFs is that the standard way ETFs are weighted (by market cap) is simply not applicable and misleading in regards to CEFs (which BDCs are).

CEFs do not trade at their real value (their NAV), this is as a result of them being closed ended (having a static amount of shares), this is unlike open ended funds such as ETFs which trade at their NAV.

As a result, some BDCs will trade at a discount (in a sense they are ""cheap"" as you can buy a dollar of value for less than a dollar), and some with trade at a premium (expensive).

Once you understand that it is clear that the market cap of a BDC is not a valid indicator of its ""worth"", even though discount/premium ratios remain within certain ranges.

Moreover, the size of a lender is not a good indicator of its skill or track record. If I were to lend money to anyone who knocks on my door no questions asked I would definitely rack up a meaningful sum of debt owed - but does that make me a better investment that a prudent lender that would rather turn borrowers away?

Last but not least, ""diworsification"".  
Again, remember that BDCs are not your regular companies that fill popular indexes like the S&P500. There are trash funds run by fund managers that are lining their pockets on your expense.

Apple does not charge its investors a yearly fee, so even if management waste 10bil on a failed project causing their stock price to temporarily be suppressed an investor is better served by sitting tight and seeing things through.

The same cannot be said about CEFs, you are actively losing money by holding a loser by way of fees. And if the fund management has a bad track record there is no reason to expect them to magically turn things around.

The proof is in the pudding - the performance of BIZD leaves a lot to be desired.

Here is a comparison of BIZD against the BDCs that I am personally invested in (this list of BDCs is in no way a buy recommendation, these are simply the ones that I personally like):

[Comparison on a total return basis \(divs reinvested\)](https://preview.redd.it/jeepb0ds8xoc1.png?width=4014&format=png&auto=webp&s=6959d052387c4b0ca8edd2136ccebfdb04b1374d)

The income generated from holding BIZD is also not a strong selling point, and somehow managed to go down in 2023 which was an absolutely stellar year for BDC income generation:

https://preview.redd.it/ogciaqsy9xoc1.png?width=2696&format=png&auto=webp&s=510cf469838098ad44d125c64b758f65470604ad

The full backtest can be found [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=35rs2ApIBmr7qVQkk5xCNj).

Doing due diligence on individual funds requires effort and time but if you want exposure to BDCs (and other such holdings) it is a requirement.

Before I sign off let me address the inevitable comment:

>But what about PBDC?

IMO, PBDC is not comparable to a buy&hold strategy as it actively trades BDCs based off of discounts/premiums - which is a valid strategy of and by itself but not the same strategy.

As for PBDC's performance, it is still very short lived but it already seems to be falling behind the buy&hold strategy

"JEPQ vs SCHD; noob here, why would anyone put money in SCHD?I am doing alright with my long-term investing so far, growing ok, decided to check out this sub with interest in growing some passive income over time as well. Been seeing MANY people suggesting or actually putting money in SCHD. Is it just the diversification factor? I have been looking and comparing and other than the unfortunate inclusion of TSLA in JEPQ I don't understand why anyone would invest in SCHD.

Plese forgive whatever I may be missing here (and please educate me?), I am totally new to the dividend stuff, and fairly new to investing in general.

What I am seeing is double to triple dividends with JEPQ (for the sake of argument let's call it 8.75 vs 3.5), and while I get there is very little history here and the two are relatively equally flat over the last couple years valuewise;  Consumer Discretionary has been a strong sector and is better held by JEPQ. So coupling that with the fact we are in the infancy of the AI era, doesn't that position JEPQ to blow SCHD out of the water in overall value over at least the next 10 years as well?

Even if SCHD recovers this year to alltime high we are talking 5% from where it is now right? I understand the fund goes way back compared to JEPQ, but if one takes into account that any progress made from 2014 was lost to 2020, really the gains start there right?

"Advice on Long-Term Dividend Investing in a Brokerage AccountHi guys, new dividend investing noob here.

I have mostly been involved in investing in growth stocks and ETFs. I max out my 401k and mega-backdoor every year (\~$65k/year) with VTSAX, VOO, and target vanguard retirement funds. I also additionally contribute $20k-30k on the side in a normal brokerage account buying some individual growth stocks I think will be worth in the future (Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Google, Nvidia..., the usual bunch). None of this will change even after I begin investing into dividends.

Due to my income, I cannot contribute to a Roth IRA as I am over the limit, and I already max out all my retirement accounts with the ETFs mentioned above (my employer doesnt even offer dividend ETFs as an option so I can't even do a split here if I wanted to). If I want to begin investing into dividends stocks my only option is to do it via a normal brokerage account.

My plan is to contribute $1k/month to SCHD and continue doing so for the next couple decades (playing the long game here). My goal is to eventually get my monthly dividends to meet my monthly expenses. However, I was curious how much I would lose to taxes since these funds won't be in any tax-advantaged account and if it is smart to invest this much in a normal brokerage account if I want to eventually achieve my goal of living off dividends (or at least have the option to).

On a side note, anyone got any good books/resources they recommend that mainly focus on dividend investing. Mainly watch YouTube videos and read Reddit posts as of now",12-30-2023

"Diversity is keyiv put some thought lately Into this and really all you need is JEPQ and SCHD and your good, however there are two caviaiarts ,

one you miss out on capital gains from superstar picks, example being McDonald's has gained me almost 40% in the last 12 months, you need to add individual div stocks to hit some good ones in the longer term,

Two there is greater risk in not splitting 4% or 3% portfolio principle Max's into areas, if one these ETF liquidated in a blackswan or a credit default it could ruin someone's life. why diversity works and is the safer investment approach.

personally I also have been chasing more growth stocks particularly the blue chips Tesla and recently my eyes looking at Disney and even INTC as a possible 5 year superstar play, as competition is surly to raise against NVDA just a food for thought to the investment bros, I'm all for the Etfs and a simple 4 stock portfolio is simple and easy but if your a real investor and you take things seriously then having a 60 stock portfolio is the way.

"Bought 2538 shares of TSLY this week to see how it goes.Running an experiment with TSLY.  Bought 2538 shares at a basis of $13.79 to see how well these funds actually work.

I've made $1k in capital appreciation so far, which is emotionally reassuring, but meaningless.  My buy case:

* I'm a believer in Tesla over the long term.
* Tesla volatility is insane.  It's not a meme stock, but has almost that level of obsession over it.  People trading in and out all the time.
* Saw an article that says ""TSLY is not how to play Tesla.""  I disagree.  If it's going to be that volatile, may as well profit off the volatility, instead of seeing your paper gains erased over and over again.  But then, I'm into dividends, so there's that.
* Reinvesting the dividends into other assets.  So for the first 18 months - 2 years, the functional effect is that I sold my previous position to DCA into the assets I'm reinvesting into.  Only once TSLY has paid back it's investment am I really seeing much difference from a DCA (ignoring whatever paper gains or losses TSLY experiences.)
* Curious how much (if any) share price erosion will occur over the next 2 years.  TSLY had a big drop shortly after release tied to the drop in Tesla.  But that's not the same as erosion, which you would get with a \*YLD fund.

I think I'll be ok, so long as Tesla does ok.  If it doesn't well, from where I sit, there's not much difference in risk between buying this and an equivalent amount of TSLA.

Anyway, wish me luck!  Hoping that after 18 months to 2 years, TSLY will have paid for itself in other assets, and I'll still have a valuable asset in TSLY generating significant income.  But we'll have to see how it works out.

EDIT:  The account I bought this in was an IRA containing the rollover of my 401k from my previous employer.  I can't contribute to this account, since I'm contributing to a Roth.  But my thinking was hopefully this is a way of getting some ""stealth contributions"" to the account, from income return on investments.  Hoping for $1500 - $2000 per month in dividends.

They tell me there's 0 fees for buying & selling plain stocks and ETFs; I can't help but feel like I get some hidden value in holding their ETFs over another brokerage's.
2. In general, should I sell lower performers in order to buy higher performers? Or do I hold, but subsequently only buy said better performers? I'm looking to safely ""snowball,"" but I recognize that growth trumps dividend income at my age.
3. I bought 100 shares of Lucid some years ago when there was plenty of hype. I'm reluctantly holding, in hopes of some sort of turn around. Selling for $680 doesn't seem worth it, considering the small chance it becomes the next Tesla.
4. What 'literature' do y'all read? The Economist? The WSJ?

"Investing now in an All World ETF?Hello together. I want to invest some money in ETF's and of course thr All World is popping up regularly as a good investment. Given the high raise of the tech industry and therefore leading the all world, do you think this is the right moment to invest? Aapl, nvidia and tesla are among the top 5 to top 10 positions in this ETF but they are on their all time high...what do you think?",07-29-2023
"Investment strategy for growth and dividendsSo I‚Äôm pretty late to the investing game (39, began in January).  However I do have a pension with my company and can ‚Äúretire‚Äù at 55 (anticipated monthly pension currently is $3,500 but increases each year as we get a raise).  I‚Äôve been with this company for 12 years and every check they take $150 and put into my pension fund, so that‚Äôs nice.  
So I also invest $200 a month (and any extra cash I come across, such as birthday, holidays, etc) into my Roth IRA I opened with Fidelity in January.  I currently have $3,500 in it for the year and so far my portfolio is up 13-15%. 

So I‚Äôm trying to absorb as much info on investing strategies as I can.  From what I am seeing, it‚Äôs a split between having 30 different holdings or 10 holdings.  Of course everyone has an opinion but the 30 holdings makes sense to me for diversifying.  I currently have 25 holdings, and I am overweight into the tech sector.  I bought NVDA early and it‚Äôs now up 220%, so I‚Äôm thinking of selling for a stock in a different sector (like Basic Materials as I‚Äôm lacking there).  I also have Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple for some of my large cap stocks.  

So from my reading, I have large cap, mid cap, small cap stocks along with international, REITs, and ETFs.  

You guys sold me on SCHD, JEPI and JEPQ.  

So I‚Äôm ok with risk as I am late to the Roth IRA game, and my pension is a huge plus.  

So my goal now is growth stocks that offer dividends, so I am selling Tesla for a materials stock (I like BHP and NTR, but doing research).   

So in summary, spread large, mid, small, international, REIT and ETF stocks across all ten sectors (basic materials, tech, financial, consumer cyclical, consumer defensive, energy, healthcare, industrial, utilities and communication services) that may offer decent growth along with dividend payments.  

I‚Äôm open to suggestions and feedback on anything I‚Äôm missing or overthinking.  

My current holdings:  TSLA, JNJ, NVDA, MSFT, JEPI, AAPL, JPM, MA, SBUX, TXN, SCHD, LOW, TXRH, JEPQ, KLIC, SWBI, TNC, ETD, SMDV, ANDE, SHOP (I know, no dividends but I liked the growth potential), VICI and O.",07-21-2023

"ETFs vs 10 dividend stocksNoob Alert! I am new to the game and did inform myself about dividend investing before, but there is still one thing I am not sure about. 

Saw a yt video about learnings after 5 years of dividend investing and he preferred to have a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù portfolio of 10 dividend stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, etc) to be able to keep track of them easily instead of relying on an ETF like VOO, SCHD or JEPI. Now, both methods look legit to me but what are the downsides/upsides of managing your own small portfolio of 10 stocks to having all in VOO and SCHD for example. 

Is the yield of the ETFs lower due to added costs of the 3rd party managing the fund on average? The only pro I see for the etf is the ‚Äúinvest and forget‚Äù mode. Is there anything I am overseeing or is it just more  beneficial to invest into stocks that would be in the etf anyway myself, knowing that it is a little more work?

"My current portfolioHello fellow investors,

So I‚Äôm not looking for help or advice. I‚Äôm posting my portfolio because I see a lot of new people investing in 30+ companies. Which I understand because I use to be that guy. 

A little background about me. I‚Äôm 32M working in property management/real estate. I started investing in 2017 when I was 26, which I though was late. I make a modest income. (Modest can mean a lot to everyone). I invest about $500-$1000 a month. 

If you have Schwab, you know what the numbers mean by each position. But I have my account split up in to 3 taxable and 2 Roth.

I personally like growth and dividend investing, together. With this portfolio, I‚Äôve beat the meager return of the S&P each year except last year which I think we all took an L. This year, this portfolio is currently up 88%, obviously due to PLTR and TSLA. 

The dividend part (just the dividend stocks) of this portfolio returns 6.7% or $1325 a year. If you look at the portfolio as a whole it‚Äôs a 2.7% Dividend Yield but 3.1% YOC.

ACI paid a special dividend this year which has my current year total $1720. Once the merger is complete with KR I plan on rolling the funds there. 

I‚Äôm posting this to mostly help the newer people. I started in the same position as everyone else. Took my else and as I build conviction in these companies, I consolidated. You don‚Äôt need to invest in the entire market. Find companies you like, sectors you know, and ride with it. 

Investing is different for everyone. This is my take. 

Take care.",07-09-2023
"Suggestions on how to invest my savingsHello all,

I'm looking for help/suggestions on how to start investing my savings. My goal is long term growth, and ideally enough dividends to survive off of for retirement. Below is a break down of current available funds and current investments.

Current savings:

"Re: Stakeholder capitalismA few hours ago, u/No-Aerie3500 posted in this subreddit the following post: [Stakeholder Capitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/133o4pn/stakeholder_capitalism/)

> My biggest concern for future in dividend investing is rise of esg politics, woke and stakeholder capitalism , because this is just a different name for pure Socialism? Change my mind.? 

I spent the last three hours writing a comment response to this post, only to find out comments have a character limit of 10,000.  Well, I wrote 17,000 characters.  Instead of deleting 50% of my comment, I am posting it here as a separate post.  You can see my response below.  Since I just copy/pasted it, the formatting may be off slightly.  I will go back and edit it to fit any formatting mistakes.

\-------------------------

I will take your post in good faith, even though it is worded in a way some may find offensive.

I will talk about all three of the principles you brought up: woke, ESG, and Stakeholder capitalism.  

I will start with stakeholder capitalism.

Stakeholder capitalism essentially means that companies must take into account the opinions and beliefs of those who will be affected by their decisions.  In my opinion, that is a good thing.  Both from a citizen perspective, and a shareholder perspective.  The last thing I want is one of my investments destroying its own future market just so the current group of executives can get better bonuses.

I move into an investment with the mindset of holding the company for the next 30 years.  If a company is actively engaged in killing off its own market (tobacco), then I do not traditionally want to invest in said company.

I prefer investments that are a value add.  It is often said that in a good business, your best customers should be your employees.  If the people who worked at Home Depot all shopped at Lowe's, would that give you confidence in the products offered by Home Depot?  Probably not.  If everyone who worked at Costco all shopped at Sam's Club, what would that make you think about Costco?

Studies consistently show that employees who are better paid not only perform better, but also generate more profits than employees who are paid less. It makes sense when you think about it.  The employee who is making a living wage from their job does not need to worry about putting food on the table.  They are not constantly distracted by outside life on their work, thus allowing them to focus and perform at a higher level.  This is especially true in customer facing roles.  People genuinely happy at their jobs will create a positive experience for the customer, making them want to come back in the future.  Economists call this concept the [efficiency wage](https://www.investopedia.com/efficiency-wages-5206757).  

There are several brands you know of that actively incorporate this into their business model, with great effect.  Chick Fil A understands this concept to a T, and drills it into the heads of their franchise owners during their training process.  This leads to excellent results, as almost anyone who has been to or worked at a CFA will tell you.  The chain consistently leads the QSR industry in both order accuracy and speed of service.  On the casual dining side, Texas Roadhouse understands the efficiency wage as well.  Amongst the nationwide restaurant chains, Texas Roadhouse is known as having one of the highest starting wages for most positions, and managers can expect compensation packages above the industry average.  Beyond restaurants, you have companies like Costco & Home Depot that understands paying people more reduces turnover costs and improves employee morale.  Netflix (and pretty much all the big tech companies) are well averse in the efficiency wage, with Netflix standing out as a company that intentionally wants to be in the 99th percentile when it comes to compensation.

The efficiency wage is an example of **stakeholder capitalism**.  It is taking a companies decision (how much to pay workers) and is checking that against the opinions of the stakeholders (workers) affected by the decision, and factoring in their reactions.  Paying workers less will cause workers to be less productive and quit, which increases the cost of doing business.  Accounting departments say that recruiting and onboarding a new employee is more expensive than retaining an already existing employee.  Workers paid more produce more profits due to higher morale, thus it is in the best interests of the investors for workers to be paid more.

Next we will talk about ESG.  Environmental, Social, Governance concerns.  As an investor, I am also on the face of it in favor of ESG.  Unfortunately, many companies try to lie and cheat their way onto these indexes, twisting definitions so it makes things muddy, but I will get to that part.

Environmental is pretty straightforward.  Companies should care about the environment. It makes sense that if you are going to make money, that you should try to keep the business environment healthy so you can continue to make money in the future.  Speaking as someone who went to business school, many people in business do not care about the future, only the short term gains.  I like to buy companies with the idea of passing those shares down to my future children, so a company that destroys itself does not really appeal to me.

The best, most visible example of this principle in action within the United States can be found in the logging industry.  For hundreds of years, trees were cut down by loggers and never replanted.  This led to massive losses in forests across the United States.  However, as of 2023, we actually have more forest land in the US than we did 100 years ago.  How?  Because federal law dictates that for every tree cut down for commercial logging, a new tree must be replanted and (depending on state expansions of the law) allowed to grow to the same age as the previously cut tree.  Couple that with increased protections over the forests on federal land, and you see net growth.

In decades past, logging companies would move through the forests, cut down trees, then move on.  However, the laws protecting our forest lands forced the logging companies to change their business model.  And as the American logging industry now readily admits, this shift made them **more profitable**.  No longer were they paying property owners for permission to cut down trees on their land.  No longer were they having to buy land, cut down the trees, then sell the land to developers.  Now, they would buy up parcels of land, cut down the trees, replant new trees, let the trees grow, cut them down, and repeat the cycle for infinite wood production.  This allowed for lumberjacks to settle down in one place, which no longer meant having to pay them to move from place to place.  It also allowed for consistent and modern supply chains to be developed.  Back in the day, they would often cut down the logs, then quite literally [just float them down the river and rely on others to catch the logs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_driving)  This has 100% of the problems your brain races to.  Did people steal the logs? Yes.  Did logs get stuck causing rivers to back up creating floods?  Yes.  Did it lower the quality of the wood? Yes. Was this dangerous? Yes.

This change in practice is an early example of the E aspect of ESG.  Companies making these concerns known and addressing them proactively is something we should commend.  

The social aspect primarily focuses on diversity.  Many businesses (especially in the US) used to have a whites only hiring policy.  Until such practices were banned, it was quite commonplace.  The idea of diversity hiring is often misunderstood.  It is not to disadvantage white applicants, but to rectify the disadvantages that historically were in place for non white employees.  JP Morgan is the largest bank in the world.  It has multiple predecessor banks, the earliest dating back to 1799.  However, despite this long history and massive size, JPM itself recognizes that it was not until 1966 (current CEO Jamie Dimon was 10 years old) when they had a black man as a bank manager.  Aubrey W Lee, who worked in Detroit.  So this means for 167 years, JP Morgan Chase and its predecessors and subsidiaries were unable to find a single black man capable of running one bank branch?  No.  JPM itself admits that the company previously had a whites only hiring policy in management roles.  

Diversity in hiring is the idea that while the company may have in the past had a white only or men only hiring policy, that there may still be residual criteria in the hiring and selection processes that disadvantage non white candidates, leading to situations that inadvertently advantage white or male candidates/employees.  Companies that want to have only the most qualified candidates for a role should actively look through and reevaluate their hiring and promotion criteria from the ground up to eliminate any of those vestigial items that could continue to have the effect of discrimination.

Here is one example:

Many companies have requirements for promotion mandating a certain amount of tenue (time spent employed) at a firm. Oftentimes hourly roles may have a minimum number of hours worked.  All else being equal, most firms will tend to choose the employee who has been with the firm longer, assuming they have more experience.  However, the systems used to calculate said tenue and hours often would exclude time taken off due to pregnancy or childbirth.  After all, that should not count as time spent working in the role, right?  Not necessarily.  Notice how the definition changed.  I first said tenure was time spent *employed*.  But when you did the math, I said tenue was time spent *working in the role*.  The definition has now changed from a gender neutral definition to one that advantages men.  Women who would otherwise be qualified for a position should not be denied because their male colleagues were not under doctor's orders to remain at home away from work after giving birth to another human.  If you think I am cherry picking, such situations are very real. (Insert [Study from Harvard proving the point](https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/getting-job-there-motherhood-penalty))  

The company I currently work for used to evaluate promotion ready tenue as the ""date from continuous employment.""  Not the hire date.  Vacations would not impact your continuous employment date, but FMLA leave would.  FMLA protects women taking time off due to pregnancy.  So a women taking a week off for her childbirth under the FMLA would have her promotion tenure length reset, while her male colleague taking a week of vacation to be with his new child would keep their same tenure date without interruption.

Someone working to improve the diversity of a firm's hiring and promotion practices would notice this error in the system, and would rewrite hiring/promotion criteria to rectify this so that an employee's tenure would be based on the date they were hired, rather than on the total hours worked, or date continuously employed.  

My employer fixed the problem by changing the calculations to exclude FMLA, and instituted paid parental leave for all employees.  

This would be an example of an employer taking social considerations into account for the benefit of the investors.  We as investors want our companies management teams made up of the most qualified people, not the ones who got there just because they never gave birth.

Finally, corporate governance.

I really do not like companies with dual class shareholder structures.  Where one group of shareholders gets the voting power, and the other group of shareholders gets a participation trophy.  See [Meta](https://www.investopedia.com/facebook-stock-fb-5205635).  Class A shares are publicly traded.  Class B shares are privately traded, are primarily owned by Mark Zuckerberg, and have 10x voting rights as Class A shares, allowing Mark to exert dictatorial control over the company, as he single-handedly controls the majority of voting rights, so he cannot be fired and can do whatever he wants.  Like renaming the company to Meta and pouring tens of billions into a metaverse that tanks the stock price.

My concern with Meta's stock would be referred to as a corporate governance concern.  I believe one share should equal one vote, and I believe that dual class, triple class, or [whatever the fuck Liberty Media is doing](https://www.libertymedia.com/investors/stock-data/faq) with their shares.  I do not care if you believe in unregulated capitalism, this is a crime against humanity.  Get the Geneva conventions in here.  If you need a three thousand word essay taking up 11 pages in Microsoft Word just to explain how your Six classes of common stock trading shares are all working with each other, you are clearly just trying to confuse people on purpose because I see no other logical reason to do all of this, even after reading all three thousand words on Liberty Media's website.

After reading my tangent, it will probably come as no surprise to you then that I find the idea of investing in these kinds of companies to be repulsive. I also tend to find the idea of a dual class structure on its face as a form of market manipulation.  Shares are supposed to be ownership stakes in a company.  If you do not get ownership, what is the point?  Shares are supposed to have voting control.  Can you really claim voting control when the real voting power is held in the private shares?  I personally say no.  If each share class has a certain priority level in the event of bankruptcy, and you have three share classes, should that make me concerned about the way your corporation is being governed?  I personally think yes.

These are governance concerns.  The issue with ESG metrics as a whole is how difficult it can be to pin down what exactly should count as ESG and what should not.  On the face of it, I think that in order for there to be a healthy marketplace of competition, regulations should be written to force companies to take these concerns seriously and to make ESG part of **how** we do business.  The problem is determining where those regulatory lines should be drawn.  

Without any regulations, the stock market would become a casino.  Every business is only worth what the stock has been manipulated to be in that particular moment.  Owning shares means nothing, we are owed nothing, and all stocks would be fundamentally worthless, since there would be no laws to protect the rights of shareholders to influence the companies they own, nor would there be any laws entitling them to any share of the profits derived from the business.  

Because companies want their stock prices to be worth something, they encourage regulation.  However, only to the point where they believe it benefits them.  Beyond their own internal cost benefit analysis, the ""good regulations to promote competition"" turns into ""inhibiting business"" and ""interfering with the free markets.""

The problem with these internal cost benefit analyses is that they can often be wrong.  See the logging industry example from above.  A modern day example would be the adoption of electric vehicle regulations.  All the automakers were against it, until Tesla proved it to be a viable business model, now they all want a piece.  

California banning all new gas powered vehicles after 2030 forced automakers to develop new electric vehicles.  Ford has taken this and developed multiple electric vehicles.  Their most recent being the F-150 lightning.  A vehicle which, according to Ford itself (and neutral 3rd parties) has a smaller carbon footprint than a gas powered F-150 (so it satisfies the environmentalists), while they also project it to overtake the gas powered F-150 both in terms of sales and profitability over the next 5 years. So a win win for Ford.  As electric vehicle production continues to increase, the costs will come down due to simple economics through the principles of Economies of Scale.  Since the electric powertrain is objectively superior to the Internal Combustion Engine [(Science source)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SJRUE..24..669A/abstract) you are replacing the less efficient with the more efficient. 

There are tons of other examples, but I will move on.

Woke. Define woke.  Not really sure what you mean by woke.  In the modern day, it seems to mean ""that which socially conservative Americans disagree with.""  Unfortunately, that definition does not work in the modern world due to socially conservative Americans having a variety of different views, which can often times contradict each other.

Woke is simply a buzzword.  Like benchmarking, or paradigm, cutting edge, next generation, etc.  Companies will always use buzzwords to make themselves sound more important.   Here is an example:

&#x200B;

>As data, digital technology, globalization, new business models and other significant events and disruptions reshape the way people work, our mission is to power organizations with insightful solutions that meet the changing needs of our clients and their workers. Our HCM technology, industry and compliance expertise and data insights deliver measurable results and peace-of-mind, and contribute to an engaged, productive workforce.

This is ADP explaining their business.  They process company payrolls.  They take money from Company A, and give the money to Company A's workers.  ADP adds value to Company A by using fancy computers to make sure workers get paid the correct amount, Uncle Sam (or other relevant government) gets his cut, and doing this cheaper than what it would cost Company A to do this on their own. ADP earns revenue by getting paid for this service they provide to these businesses (expressed as a percentage of the payroll expense, like Visa or Mastercard for paychecks), and they earn profit by doing this service at a large enough scale where it costs less for them than what they charge businesses.

Woke is nothing but another buzzword. Politicians use it to make their own views more important.  It means nothing.  It used to have meaning many years ago, but the term has been so overused that nobody really uses it correctly anymore, so it has become meaningless.",04-30-2023

Feedback is welcomed! 30-year-old investor new to dividend investing! My portfolio is now primarily dividend focused with some growth. Adding $1000 monthly to DCA and set of DRIP.,03-29-2023
"Starting over with $170K.Hi everyone,

I started my Brokerage account journey in late December 2022. Initially, I made the decision to invest $10K per stock. It consisted of picking 2 companies per 9 selected sectors. My estimated annual dividend payout is approximately $5K. 

As you can see in my portfolio performance, I have significant losses in 6 stocks, but my biggest breadwinners are keeping me even at this point.

At this time, I'm thinking of selling all stocks with the exception of TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, PEP, ABBV, LOW, & SCHD.

My next strategy is to use the available funds to invest in ETFs, JEPI, SCHD, VONG, and buy more of AAPL. My goals are to have fewer individual stocks, for easy management, and more ETFs. My overall goal is to build long-term wealth and dividend income.

I would like to hear your opinions about my potential moves. Is there a better way you may handle this situation?

Thank you.

TSLY ETF OpinionI‚Äôm surprised no one has talked about this fairly new covered call ETF but basically it‚Äôs just a covered call ETF on Tesla and it‚Äôs yielding 65% as of now and obviously the yield won‚Äôt stay that high but the fund manager said the yield can stay high as long as Tesla stays flat or doesn‚Äôt make any crazy upwards moves. They also have OARK for ARKK and they‚Äôre coming out with a Apple and Berkshire covered call ETF that‚Äôs supposed to launch at the end of March. I was wondering what is y‚Äôall opinion on these ETF‚Äôs?,03-22-2023
"VOO vs SCHD Long Term?Hey guys, im 27, net worth about 1.4 million and im finally starting to get out of my WSB yolo phase.

I did really good in 2020-2021 with Tesla & Bitcoin and my eCommerce business and I summed up a decent sized net worth to the point where I dont want to invest in growth stocks anymore in this environment.

My plan is to do: 50% index funds, 20% individual stocks, 20% cash, 10% bonds.

I opened a SEP IRA and my CPA told me to invest 25% of my yearly companies revenue into it so I can use that as a tax deduction while investing into my retirement. My plan was to go 50% SCHD and 50% VOO in my SEP IRA account.

What do you guys think I should do? Any advice?",03-16-2023

"What to do with my portfolio?Hey guys, I am 24 y.o. European. Currently studying at Uni and I will hopefully finish my studies next year. I don¬¥t have regular job but I managed to build this portfolio. And after I am done with school, I plan to invest a lot into stocks from my monthly income.

So here are my few questions, since I know here are a lot of smart guys.

&#x200B;

1. I want to have less stocks, under 30 would be ideal, but don¬¥t know which ones to sell.
2. Is my portfolio diversified enough? What would you change?
3. Which stocks am I missing? Or which ones would you suggest me to buy?
4. Basically overall which stocks would you suggest me to sell and buy? So that I have around 30 or less.

&#x200B;

I want to hold all my stocks and eventually retire and have stable income from them (know it¬¥s not 100 % possible, you sell and buy stocks but don¬¥t want to daytrade them).

Since I am from Europe, I don¬¥t feel that comfortable with holding European ETF¬¥s

I love dividents, and want most of my stocks that pay dividends, but also got few that don¬¥t.

&#x200B;

It is around 10 000 $, here is the portfolio :

VUSD around 12 %

GOOGLE around 6 %

Microsoft, Tesla, Apple, O, Amazon around 4 %

ABBV, APD, T, BAC, BRK.B, BLK, KO, ENB, JNJ, AVGO, JPM, LMT, LOW, MCD, NEE, PEP, PG, RIO, SBUX, TGT, UNP, UNH, VICI, VISA, WPC, VOW Around 3.5 - 2 %

21yo Looking for advice,02-21-2023
"Advice on dividend ETFs for planning to retire earlyHey everyone. I'm 37 and have about $200k invested in my brokerage account(I have a separate 300k in my employer sponsored retirement account). I'm not an active investor, so I have about 70% in SPY, and then 30% split between Appl, Tesla, Microsoft, ATT, and a few others. My thought was to invest in more dividend ETFs and diversify, while looking to retire as early as I can. I've used dollar cost averaging, while adding a bit more when there were clear market dips, so I'm currently up about 7% overall. 

For some additional context, I have a high paying job and I'm currently (now) able to invest another $5-6k a month outside of maxing out my 401k. I have all debt paid off except mortgage. 

Looking for any thoughts and advice on approach. Thanks for the help!",02-03-2023

While there is always a risk of a dividend cut, its at least in a safe place as of right now. Investors shouldn't worry too much about it.... yet.... Obviously anything at anytime can change but its nice to see the CEO talk about it to try and reassure investors

# VDY Massive Div Cut (+ Company Correction)

Vanguard announced its dividends and VDY oddly had a MASSIVE div cut from its normal \~$0.17 to $0.02 and as you can expect people freaked out, emailed Vanguard and panic looked for other funds to replace it (If this happens and seems 'insane' take a step back, email the company and wait for a response'.... looking at you DividendsCanada)  
Well Vanguard corrected the mistake and is going to pay a $0.169373 dividend per share

"Can an ETF be overvalued if its holdings are overvalued? Does it even matter?Hey all,

I'm still pretty new to investing, and I'm trying to learn all I can. So far, I'm only invested in VTI and SCHD.

I recently learned about NAV (net asset value) of an ETF. Depending on the NAV of an ETF, an ETF can be trading at a premium or discount.

What I'm trying to figure out is if anyone tracks the specific stocks in an ETF, and whether they are over or under valued.

For example, VTI holds Tesla. From everything I've been reading, Tesla is (was?) very overvalued, hence the almost 50% drop the last 6 months. If Tesla is a top holding in VTI, wouldn't VTI be overvalued as well?

I haven't been able to find anything about specific overvalued/undervalued stocks in an ETF. Does this even matter? Am I overthinking this?",01-11-2023
"Thoughts on VWINX?Relatively new to this sub but get the gist of it (SPHD, O, VOO = Good, Tesla,AMZN, NVDA = Bad). I am curious if anyone has looked into VWINX, Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund Investor Shares?

The fund has a high bond allocaiton yet generally outperforms the S&P. It offers a quarterly dividend, and annual distribution. I understand the mgmt. fee is relatiely high, but considering its safe investments, and high annual distribution, I would think it would be highly praised in this sub.",01-02-2023

"Dividend Investing ApproachI‚Äôm trying to figure out my investing strategy. All year I have been considering moving to a cash flow focused strategy. Right now I have a mix of growth stocks and popular ETFS. SCHD is the only investment that I have in my portfolio with a good dividend yield. Trying to decide if I shift to the dividend approach. 

I‚Äôm 32 and My goal is to get my income and net worth as high as possible over the next 3 years. I would reinvest probably half the dividend income live off half so trying to decide how to use the dividends. Currently, I have 240k in the stock market, 20k in SCHD 60k in SPY and 50k in QQQ. Some single stocks like Apple and Tesla. Has anyone moved a large portion of their portfolio into dividends and how have you felt about the decision? I go back and forth i don‚Äôt want to be overly reactive but the next 3-5 years I could see dividends being a better play. 

My move would be selll some of the tech stuff and to increase SCHD, invest in a few higher yielding stocks like Ares Capital, Main Street Capital, WBA, maybe O add a few with some growth and a healthy dividend like TXN, HPQ, BMY, AMGN. Any guidance would be great!",11-04-2022

"Undecided between ETFs or an individual stock portfolioFirst of all I want to thank all the people that take the time to reply. I am 19 year old right now studying engineering, although I‚Äôll be turning 20 next week. 

I started investing 2 years ago, however I did some incredible mistakes. I got influenced by those filthy ‚ÄúFinance TikToks‚Äù and bought some NIO stock at $60, also got BABA at $250. However I got some nice gains with more conservative picks like ALSEA a Mexican restaurant business, where I realized a 75% gain. I have gladly seen both sides and I want to learn from my mistakes and invest as a way of increasing my future net worth and achieving financial freedom.

I want to start buying now that the prices have been falling, It won‚Äôt be much money but I feel more comfortable buying at these prices than the ones we had a year before, I was actually waiting for a drop to start my long term portfolio.

I have read the Peter Lynch book One Up on Wall Street, I am reading the Intelligent Investor and plan on reading more investment and finance books. My main doubt before starting buying the assets is wether to do the simple ETFs portfolio with the S&P 500, International exposure with an ETF and some precious metals. Or changing ETFs for some Dividend and growth individual picks, I personally like Adidas, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Allianz at the price they are right now and of course a lot of USA companies that have dropped like NIKE, Google, etc.

One of my issues or drawbacks with ETFs is the argument of ETFs creating a bubble for the securities they hold, however my main problem is that when you buy ETFs you are buying some incredibly overvalued securities like Tesla in the specific case of the S&P 500 and companies whose direction may not be the best, like Meta with its meta verse, which I am not that bullish on. Stock picking can have a lot of issues too, like volatility, buying overvalued securities and it is time consuming.

I would thank any advise you could give me, since I am new to the finance world, which has captivated me. I also really like the idea of dividend income, although I have read a lot of people telling that young people should focus on growth. Thanks in advance.",10-09-2022

Right now it's trading at: 

\- PE of 4

\- 3.6% Dividend Yield 

\- Price-to-Book of 1

\- Price-to-Cash of 1 (meaning the market cap is equal to the amount of cash that they have on hand)

On the plus side: the chip situation is improving, they have several new exciting models ramping up production (see Ford F-150 Lightning), still strong demand for new vehicles, tons and tons of liquidity for the next downturn 

On the negative side: swimming in debt, clearly behind Tesla & VW in the electric category as a whole, their major products (Trucks & SUVs) aren't in a great spot with $5 gas, sales may decline drastically if we go towards recession. 

My take: If I wanted 100 shares, I'd probably wait to make my first purchases of about 15 share until the price falls to $11....and then buy again at $10.50, $10, $9.50, $9, $8.50 and then finally at $8.

"I don't buy income/dividend stocks on a retirement account, and that's whyNot really suggesting it is the best way to plan investment strategy, but I think I do the opposite of what many people on this sub are doing - I'm buying income/value stocks on regular account and growth stocks on tax-exempt account, and maybe after my explanation some of you might think it is a good idea or show me that it is a bad idea.

It all comes to psychology and seeing income and growth differently.

Income stocks are just less volatile and therefore more liquid in a way that I can sell many of them pretty much anytime without losses, yet they are also giving me some yield. Yes, I pay taxes for the dividend, but at the same time why wouldn't I? It is  my income and I treat it as such - not always reinvesting, sometimes withdrawing and ""paying bills"". This is a conservative part of my portfolio

Tax exempt accounts are forcing me to think for 30+ years ahead, and there I buy more risky growth stocks. Wouldn't care of 50% dip on some stocks there, as long as there's still growth potential long-term. Also, tax exemption might work even better in this case - if simplified, saving capital gains for 1500% growth (not rare for some tesla holders) is much better, than saving 19% (I'm in Poland) on a yearly dividend.",04-30-2022
"Diving into DividendsEvery time I talk about dividends to my friends who are very new to investing, it blows their minds. They can‚Äôt imagine a company paying them regularly for owning its stock. An extreme example I use is Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway which collects close to [$800M in dividends](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-stock-dividends-buybacks-shareholder-returns-2021-10) just from Apple every year.

[Meme stocks folks when they hear about dividends](https://i.redd.it/7pz2mt3ybht81.gif)

For those who are new to the world of dividends, a dividend is a distribution of some of the earnings of the company to its shareholders and the dividend yield is just a simple percentage of how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. If the stock price of a company is $100 and the company issued $5 in dividends, then the dividend yield is 5% \[1\].

Consider the example of the following companies which have some of the highest dividend yields in the S&P500:

https://preview.redd.it/1eqac1c0cht81.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ccb297d9f0a286eb21a6950d8ea233de8d9102d

If you had $100K invested equally across these companies, you would have received on average around $7k last year just as dividends - this is not including any gains you would have made holding on to the stock. And herein lies the allure for dividend investing.

If you have a significant allocation of capital to these high-yielding dividend stocks, you would get a steady cash flow in the form of dividends while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of capital appreciation. This is considered the holy grail of investing as you don‚Äôt have to sell off your asset (*and incur capital gain tax*) but at the same time you enjoy a steady stream of passive income in the form of dividends. There are [hundreds of thousands of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends) who swear by dividend investing and even big shots like Kevin O‚ÄôLeary have said that he will never invest in a non-dividend paying company \[2\]!

**But**, as with everything else in investing, my motto has always been

>*If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!*

So before we go all-in on a dividend portfolio, let‚Äôs analyze if the importance of dividends is overblown, whether we can achieve the same results by investing in non-dividend paying stocks, and finally what the ideal portfolio allocation to dividend stocks should be, if any?

**Why do some companies pay a dividend while others don‚Äôt?**

First, we have to understand this difference.

Generally, companies that pay a dividend are mature organizations that are growing relatively slowly and do not see any better investment opportunities where they can deploy their capital\[3\]. Adding to this, a steady and consistent dividend over the years shows investors that the company is financially strong and the management is responsible - both of which make it an attractive investment. Some of the biggest companies that pay a dividend include Apple, Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, etc.

On the other end of the spectrum, companies that are expanding quickly typically won‚Äôt make dividend payments. The management believes that it‚Äôs better to re-invest the profits back into expansion and operations strategies rather than to give it back to their investors. The idea here is that if investors want a payout, they can sell the stock. The returns would be generated by capital appreciation (aka stock price going up) rather than as a direct payout to its investors. Famous companies that don‚Äôt pay a dividend include Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, etc.

**Which one performs better over the long run?**

Given that there are amazing companies in both buckets, the question becomes which type of companies perform better over the long run. This is where it gets interesting. [Hartford Research](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/dam/en/docs/pub/whitepapers/WP106.pdf) conducted an analysis where they divided stocks into two categories - Dividend payers and dividend non-payers based on their dividend payout behaviors during the previous 12 months. Even among dividend payers, they differentiated between the companies that increased or reduced their dividends.

[Source: Hartford Research](https://preview.redd.it/4pahnph3cht81.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=86371762bfe686295d0e923521c83784fb3b024d)

The companies that paid dividends gave almost 2x the return of an equal weight S&P 500 index and the companies that did not give out a dividend massively underperformed both the index as well as the market! Among the companies that paid a dividend, companies that increased their dividend year on year contributed to the maximum amount of return.

The cherry on top is this: not only did the companies that paid a dividend outperform both the market and the non-payers, but they also did it with much lower volatility.

And it‚Äôs not just the U.S market that exhibits this trend. A similar study conducted on a global portfolio \[4\] from 1990 to 2013 gave the following results.

>Dividend paying stocks outperform their non-paying counterparts by a dramatic amount. From 1991 through 2015, non-dividend paying stocks earned just +4.18% return per year while dividend paying stocks significantly outperformed with a +9.7% average annual return - [Factset](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/images/519/95699/LVW-Why-Dividends-Matter.pdf)

**Explaining the outperformance!**

I was as stumped as you are right now when I saw these results. I explored multiple research articles to find a reason for this outperformance. While this can be a standalone analysis on its own, the most convincing reason I could find was that because dividend companies are usually mature enterprises, their growth prospects are not going to be high.

This usually allows investors to purchase these stocks at a discount when compared to growth stocks. *(P/E ratio of Tesla is 209 compared to Coca-Cola trading at 27)*. The chances of all these high-growth companies living up to their valuation are much lower than decently valued companies just chugging along and paying dividends.

If you are still not convinced, here‚Äôs a bit of trivia - Guess the best performing U.S stock from 1968 to 2015? It‚Äôs almost 5 decades during which we landed on the moon, experienced iPhone, and made unimaginable progress in Computing and Telecommunications. So this company must have created something revolutionary and must have changed the world - right?

The company that a lot of investors shunned (*for good reason*) in a declining industry produced the highest return because it was just a boring old Cigarette company paying consistent dividends over 5 decades! As they say, [boring is good in investing.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/10/11/why-boring-stocks-outperform-over-the-long-term/?sh=54d6cfac606d)

Importance of Reinvesting Dividends

Given that we now have conclusive evidence that dividend-paying stocks outperform their counterparts, it‚Äôs extremely important to understand how investing your dividends helps snowball the growth of your portfolio.

Reinvestment is the process of putting the dividend we receive back into the stock. For example, say we have $100K worth of AT&T stock. With the current dividend yield, you would get $2.2K every quarter. Instead of spending this, we buy back AT&T stock for the dividend they issue - and rinse and repeat it throughout the investment time period.

**Word of Caution**

It wouldn‚Äôt be wise to end this without covering the limitations of this approach.

* **Dividends aren't guaranteed** \- Even though dividend-paying companies are not as volatile as growth stocks, you shouldn‚Äôt solely rely on dividend income as it can fluctuate based on market conditions. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, 14% across the world eliminated their dividends and 41% of the firms reduced their dividends.
* **Chasing a high dividend yield is a bad idea** \- Just evaluating your investment based on how much dividend the company is paying is bound to end up hurting your portfolio. You should always look into the company fundamentals before making your investment. To quote Raymond Dev,  
*More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a¬†gun*
* **Taxes** \- Dividends are famous as a passive income strategy. You should definitely optimize based on your tax bracket as sometimes capital gain tax (by selling stocks) would be lesser than taxes on dividends.

**Conclusion**

Investing in dividend stocks does seem to produce out-sized returns. Do note that if you are currently investing in S&P500, more than 80% of the companies on the list are dividend payers. So you are automatically allocating a large chunk of your portfolio to dividend stocks. Just make sure the fund you are on is reinvesting the dividends instead of issuing it as a payout.

For those who are all-in on growth stocks, if your investment horizon is long, do consider moving some part of it to well-established dividend stocks as history shows us that companies growing to their expected valuations are rare!

"Refinancing car for more investing cash flowHey there I am a adult student in college. I currently have a 6 year (1 year into it) auto Loan on a Tesla that I have been considering refinancing.

"You should Know the History of S&P 500 Dividend Yield Before Investing In Dividend ETFs...&#x200B;

[Historical dividend yields](https://finasko.com/sp-500-dividend-yield/) of the S&P 500 reveal that dividends have been a central part of stock valuations for nearly 150 years. During the 1990s, however, this trend reversed itself. Low or negative interest rates and ongoing corporate-financial restructuring have made it difficult for companies to return money to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. As a result, the average annual yield for the S&P 500 Index has fallen to 3.5% since 1980 and below 2% since 2010.

# Dividend Yield vs Treasury Yield

This is a highly unexpected situation because the treasury yield is regarded as a risk-free rate of return, whereas stock dividend yield is a rate of return earned on stocks and the capital appreciation that can occur.

The answer is simple - You need to understand the rule of Diversification. Whenever you buy a stock/crypto/assets, it comes with a certified % of the risk. If you have $10000 and spend it to buy/long on Tesla stock, that is a high risk-reward game because it may be going against you, and that's why it's gambling, not investing.

So my point is you have to diversify your portfolio with multiple stocks and ETFs. If you have $10000, then you can spend it in 3 categories -

1. High Range - [ARKK](https://finasko.com/arkk-holding/) & QQQ ETF
2. Medium Range (Go with Market) - [S&P 500 ETFs](https://finasko.com/invest-sp-500-index-fund/)
3. Low Range - Invest in Dividend Stocks and ETFs

**Note:** Keep 20% cash, which helps you grape opportunities, and whenever the market goes down, you can buy [blue-chip stocks](https://finasko.com/blue-chip-stocks/) on the dip.

"2024, my year in review: Lost a lot of $$, but learnt worth $$$$$$$# Story of a newbie options trader

*(Warning: Long but interesting read ;) )*

As the year draws to a close, I wanted to share my story, and my resolution for 2025. I hope you find the story interesting, and maybe we can learn something from each other.

I started learning and trading options in Apr 2024 ... the basics -- what are calls / puts? expiry dates, strike price ... learnt the jargon ... DTE??? ... LOL, I only knew DTF until then. Jokes aside.

I'm an engineer, and pretty good at math. I started loving options trading, because I realized that it is not really 'gambling', it is mathematics :)

Apr 2024: Trading  
I was never an 'investor' mindset. I used to buy stocks low, and sell them when I get 10% profit. Then I tried options ... Started selling puts. This worked fine until the market started acting crazy from Aug. My puts got assigned, but fortunately had liquid cash. Waited for a while for the stock to go back up, but it didn't hence sold at a loss.  
\>>> First mistake: If you get assigned by shorting (cash secured) puts, use covered calls until you make profit, and then let the covered call get assigned, and exit the trade

Aug-Oct: Investor  
Watched a lot of YouTube videos from prominent economists, CEOs from JP Morgan, Golman Sachs and the like ... Everyone unanimously said that the market was overvalued and was due for a crash. Buffet was sitting on a cashpile of $300 billion+ ... I bought puts hoping to make a shitload of money when the market crashes and then reinvest it back at the bottom ... and hopefully be a f\*king millionaire by 2025. I really wanted to be an 'investor'  
Surprise, Surprise!!! DIDN'T WORK!!!  
\>>> Second mistake: Never buy options (either calls or puts) without getting a CLEAR direction from the market. Without a direction, you're simply gambling! Never 'bet' only based on the views of experts -- they may be right -- but ""markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"". Learnt the hard way

After a lot of introspection, I started realizing that I can't really make money from options if I'm a ""perma-bear"" waiting for a black swan event to happen. Markets are designed to go up in the long run. No one wants them to go down. I started training my brain to become a bull. I came across an excellent quote -- ""Bears sound clever, but bulls make money""

Nov: Bitcoin  
My P&L had almost evened out by Nov, and I wanted to start afresh. I was hopeful of a Harris victory (because I lean left of center, but that's another matter). But when Trump started leading on Nov 5th, I decided I will be on the bulls side. I bought a lot of IBIT. I bought TESLA. It paid off. I am now trading options for IBIT and TESLA.

Then, I came across Microstrategy. I spent hours listening to various podcasters, critics, and folks on X. I realized that MSTR is a ""trader's dream""! With its volatility, a good trader can really make a lot of money. And I did, I made thousands in profit buying MSTR call options!! Until ... I bought call options when it was at an ATH, and it crashed like a pack of cards. LOL  
\>>>> Third mistake: NEVER buy options when the volatility is high, and the stock is at an ATH or ATL. Wait for a direction.  
Disclaimer: I am NOT promoting bitcoin or MSTR .. It could be applicable to any volatile stock, like TSLA.

Some other learnings:  
\-Unless you learn the greeks, you don't know what you're doing in options  
\-When the volatility is high, sell options  
\-When the volatility is low, buy options  
\-Wait for a trend  
\-When buying options, always prefer ones with the farthest DTE, and when selling options always consider the closest possible DTE to get the theta benefit.  
\-Preferably choose LEAPS (with deep ITM calls), and do covered calls  
\-Choose OTM strike prices only if you are REALLY sure. The risk is too high

In summary, I made a profit of around $105k in 8 months, and loss of $130k (My starting capital was around $140k). I consider it as an investment of $25k, and I think I learned a LOT in the last few months. I know I will continue to make profit. My resolution for 2025 is to minimize my losses. And some day I will be a f\*kin millionaire ;)

Hope this helps someone. Wish you all a very happy new year!!!!",12-30-2024

"History teaching me options trading?While reading my 20th century history textbook, I stumbled upon an excerpt that summarized former British Prime Minister Lloyd George's mistake. A lesson which interestingly extends to my own options trade made over a hundred years later. It reads:

>His weakness was his attachment to office and a belief that he was indispensable. Had he quit at a moment of his own choosing and set himself up as focal point of a radical opposition he might have swept back to power in the next general election. But instead he hung on, his position getting ever weaker, until his enemies overwhelmed him.

Lesson being: Despite your confidence, take the present L and regroup for a future comeback. Unless, you don't mind losing it all.   
  
PS: This resonated with me because of what happened this past Friday (Dec 20). After analysis, I concluded Teslas pullback was not finished and continued my bearish position with 100x 430 0DTE Tesla Puts $4.90 fill at 9:50AM. Out of nowhere, big buying pressure forced a reversal! I was still confident of Tesla's further descent, so instead of taking the immediate 5-10% loss and regroup for a better or equivalent entry, I held my position. It took 5hrs for the market maker pump to subside. When it resumed the downward trend I bought a small put position (50 contracts of TSLA $435.00 at $2.19 around 3PMish) to recoup my losses. I was ultimately correct, but Robinhood closed my positions at 3:30pm lol, before my main position could resurface for a 70%+ return. Aside from the brokerage screwing me, I screwed myself by not capping my risk, aka setting a stop loss. If I had taken the immediate loss on the chin, I could have found a better entry point later for a quarter of the puts premium price with even greater certainty.",12-22-2024

"New type of spread?Hey, so I don‚Äôt know if this type of spread exists, but there is somthing super interesting I want to try.

So with heavily volatile stocks like Tesla I think this new strategy would be amazing. This is how it goes 

Sell 1 out of the money calls (EXP later)

Buy 3 very slightly out of the money Call option with a weekly expiration 

Buy 3 very slightly out of the money Put option with a weekly expiration.

Sell 1 out of the money put (EXP later)

So the idea is that the call and the put you sell should be 6 times as expensive as the individual calls and puts you buy. So for example, if you buy 3 calls for 30.0 (10.0 each) the single call you sell should be 60.0. This is so even if you lose money to theta on the weekly calls and puts you sell, the premium sold will break you even. 

So what are the upsides of this? If the stock swings strongly towards any way, the profit is unlimited since the weekly expirations have high gama and are more numerous than the calls and outs bought.
So in the case that the stock price increases drastically, there are a couple of things you can do. You would buy to close the put option for a lower price, and also buy to close the call and just ride the calls you bought. Even in the senario that you don‚Äôt buy to close the call option before it‚Äôs exercised, since there is more options you bought then you sold, and since there is higher gama and closer in the money strike there will be a net positive. The other senario is when a stock drastically swings is that you would simply just close out everything for a profit.

Some issues or dilemmas with this strategy.

1- It only works on volatile stocks, if the stock trades flat and the options you buy expire worthless, very bad news. 

2- the theta will kill the value of the options that are bought. So this is one of the reasons why a ratio is required for options you sell and buy.

3- some of the options bought will expire worthless, so that‚Äôs why you need to collect enough premium from calls and puts you sell to offset this. So when the stock rises and your calls gain value and your puts expire worthless, there is a net gain because the price paid for the puts is covered already.

4- the options you sell to open should I be as close as possible in expiration as you can get them while also attaining the 6x margin in premium payed compared to the cost of one put or call you bought. The reason for this is obviously. You want the call or put you sell to also lose value with time so it evens out the time decay of the options you bought.

Good things about this strategy 

1- very low risk, essentially, during the time that the weekly options you have bought it‚Äôs impossible to lose money from volatility and large swings. Pure infinite profit.

2- the maximum you have lose from the stock trade in the week that the options haven‚Äôt expired is the price paid for the options which are already fully covered by a margin of 2x of the premium collected from selling options.

"Learned options and made about $15k doing a couple trades every work alongside my FT job this yearI've been involved in the stock market since 2017 starting off by doing stock trades without any fundamental or technical analysis which didn't take long to realize it's not an efficient way to make money.

I then opted to be a passive trader by buying into ETFs and just letting them grow over time which worked out great however I've always heard about options and it was very intimidating at first but late last year I decided to pick up a book that teaches options trading for beginners and particularly focus on covered calls. Things started to make a little more sense and I began selling/writing covered calls on existing positions I had which you'll see in the beginning months. Then shortly after that I began learning about other strategies and liked the idea of selling short puts or cash secured puts to generate residual income. As you'll see this was when I went from generating a couple hundred dollars a month to $2-3k/month.

The style of trading I enjoy is basically being a seller rather a buyer since I've read most option contracts expire worthless so I try to sell contracts for credit and the cash reserved for those contracts I leave in a money market account which generated 5% earlier this year and went down to 4.2% in the last 2-3 months once the fed cut the rates. It's not life changing amount of money but it's definitely enough to where I can see the potential in being able to double next year.

My filter criteria for looking at contracts to sell are the following:

Delta: 0.2-0.4  
IV: <= 60%  
Options volume: >= 500  
DTE: <=60 days

The reason I'm posting this is to let others who are new to options that it's a journey not a sprint and to be patient. The other reason is to share my learning with others and see if you have advice, pointers, learning resources. I am looking to continue growing and learning about options so I'd like for others to share useful resources if they have something to share. Thank you!

"I need some perspective on liquidating my assets and pursuing an Option strategy.This is just a thought that I had and I would like some perspective from the community, I have a portfolio with a bunch of Stocks on which I am long-term bullish. I own only stuff that I personally believe in and also want to support so to speak. E.g. I never bought Tesla even though I knew that it would perform well and a lot of upside potential.

I have a rather large position on NVDA and I don't mind buying more, so I am already selling CSP currently, but only for a contract at a time... so my thought was, why shouldn't I simply liquidate my assets. This would allow me a) to take home some profits and b) start from scratch and allow me to rebalance. But instead of just going ahead and purchasing the stocks, I would set up more CSP and have higher contract sizes, so for instance 5-10 NVDA contracts instead of just 1. And while doing that, I lock in some profits from the premiums... obviously, I run the risk of losing out on the upside performance, but if we do a simple mathematic example to follow this thought process through:

assuming NVIDIA hits 200 by mid 2025 (rather bullish scenario, but not impossible).. that would mean roughly 55USD profit per stock. With a position of 500 NVIDIA stocks, that would be 500 \* 55 = 27500 USD profit.

Now, lets do the same exercise with a 5 CSP that have an expiry of 30-45 days, and yield around on average 400 USD per contract. 5\*400 = 2k.. since we do want to lower the risk and lock in the profits earlier, around the 50% profit mark.. lets assume its 2k/2-3wks. 6mths = 24wks... lets take a conservative stance, and say we hve 20wks / 2wks (average duration of an option contract)  = 10 \* 2k = 20k... so yeah, if NVIDIA hits the 200 mark by mid year.. I have lost out on 7.5k profits, on the other hand.. if I go slightly more aggressive with some of my CSP positions and lock in higher profits.. the 30k is doable in 6mth?

I dont know, just thinking out loud here..still very new to all of it but I like learning and hearing the communities feedback.",12-06-2024

"Indecisive So long story short, I started with a 2K account. And have managed in 3 days to grow it to 2,600. 

I used to trade stocks, but given my confidence in reading the chart and my intuition, (I believe my eyes are seeing things I don‚Äôt see yet). 

I will do basic analytics, I‚Äôll low at the recent high and lows, I‚Äôll look at the overall trend and also see where that compares to the high and lows. I‚Äôll also use things in conjunction like the moving average, in my situation it‚Äôs always the 20 day. 

All In all I would say 90% of my trades are 7D expiration or else, if the stock price is $100, and I don‚Äôt see it moving ALOT I‚Äôll buy ITM strike of say $98. 

If it‚Äôs in what I see a heavy bullish trend, and it‚Äôs a high volatility stock I may do a OTM call for 103-104. 

I scalp, and my intuition has been paying off.

First 2 days my new account was up over $400 (trading on a 2K account). 
Today, I had a Tesla option at opening worth $20. I LEARNED TODAY EMOTION. I kept seeing it go down, and couldn‚Äôt sell. Eventually, I realized, I wiped my profits past 2 days. Sold at a lost of somewhere $400. 
Got back home, where I could focus. Ended up having actually best trading day so far outside of a loss I knew better than.

"Tesla: Upto 25% returns in next 15 monthsTesla [ticker: TSLA] is led by technologist billionaire Mr Elon Musk who is soon to get a plum position in the new incoming US administration.

The company has several models of EV Tesla and Cyber truck in the market.

Why do I consider Tesla as undervalued?

Tesla closed on November 8th at 321$, while the stock peaked in November, 2021 at 407$.

A 25% hike over 8th November closing comes only to 401$ which is very much achievable in nexy 15 months. 

Elon Musk in US administration will be able to influence/enact policies to shut out Chinese manufacturers while expanding its own markets in the North Americas.

Tesla is also about to roll out robo taxi service, and automatons in near future to diversify and augment its revenue stream.

Techonological break throughs at Space X are likely to rub off near future Tesla products which will help it to stand out of the (now crowding) EV manufacturers.

Chinese manufacturers may be able to mass produce cheap EVs but are unlikely to close the technological gap without access to latest AI chips.

Besides, North Americas, Tesla may also count China, EU, Middle East, India and SE Asia as its market with increasingly wealthy populace who are not shy in spending on quality automotives.

"TSLA Earnings After Hours: Exploring Butterfly Spreads with a 500% R/R Setup
As we approach TSLA's earnings report after today's market close, the options market is pricing in a +/- 16-point move based on implied volatility. While calendar spreads typically offer an opportunity to exploit volatility discrepancies, I've found the current setups less attractive due to suboptimal reward-to-risk (R/R) ratios, despite the 30-40 point IV skew.

Instead, I've turned my focus to butterfly spreads, which seem to present better opportunities in this high-volatility environment. Here's what I‚Äôve been screening for:

Expiration: This Friday's options
Breakeven Range: Minimum 10% between the breakeven points
Reward-to-Risk Ratio: At least 500% (5:1)
Front Leg Delta: 20-50 delta
Structure: 1/-2/1 butterfly (though variations like 1/-3/2 or Broken Wing Butterflies (BWB) could be explored, but that‚Äôs beyond the scope of this post)
Given TSLA's expected post-earnings movement, these butterfly setups can capture significant gains if the stock moves within the anticipated range. This strategy allows for tight risk control, and the favorable R/R ratio provides an interesting opportunity compared to other approaches like calendars, which, despite the IV skew, just don‚Äôt measure up this time around.

"High Reward-to-Risk Call Calendar Spreads for This Week‚Äôs Earnings ReportsI've put together some call calendar spreads for companies reporting earnings this week. The strategies shown in the attached images offer a minimum of a 800% reward-to-risk ratio (theoretical), making them some of the most cost-effective plays available.

These trades are designed to take advantage of the higher implied volatility (IV) typically seen in front-month options around earnings reports. This increased volatility often makes calendar spreads more affordable.

Naturally, after earnings are announced, IV tends to collapse, causing the value of these calendar spreads to decrease. As a result, one possible strategy is to close part of the position before the report and part afterward. These calendar spreads operate with a front delta between 20-40. Additionally, each option leg has a minimum volume of 10 today to filter out very illiquid options.

"Company Event Screener?Good evening fellow traders,

I have coded a bot that automatically places trades based on IV pricing inefficiencies and probabilities calculated by the black-scholes model. The probabilities aspect of my bot is the most crucial, but they are typically only accurate if a company has nothing going on and is trading sideways. To combat this, I use a screener to filter out anything expiring within an earnings-call or ex-dividend date. 

This week one of the trades my bot took was on Uber. All seemed to be going well until Tesla shit the bed last night and I woke up to an 8% gain on Uber's stock this morning, which was far out of my spread. My strategy is mostly automated and I rarely research any of my positions, but I would still like to mitigate risks like these if it's possible.

I'm on the verge of attempting to code something that scans headlines to add upcoming events like this to my screener so I can filter out shitty trades like this, but before I do - does anyone know if something like this already exists? Like a calendar similar to an earnings calendar but contains company events like these relevant to an industry? Would save me a ton of hours.

"Right Structures For Right CompaniesSomething interesting noticed, if going to play lotto plays like far OTM calls/puts for earning's they need to have as little time on the clock as possible like buying the week of, or following week.

1. I looked at FDX $240 strike with 9/27, 10/04, and 10/11 dates.
2. Only 9/27 actually made money or 100% return, I wonder if 9/20 made money, prob would have to close first thing in morning or extrinsic value depletes within just hours.
3. This really makes me think playing earning's the best strategy for *picking direction* are debt spreads, or possibly even credit spreads if feeling okay with spread loss so prob not.
4. Debt spreads aiming to capture intrinsic value like FDX bto $280p sto $260p would've been $750 to $2800ish

Debt spreads are really powerful for the short term, longer timeframes and they get tied up too badly vs diagonals which are more effective because they're more flexible. 

There's a sweet spot between too volatile of a ticker, using a diagonal which will get blow through twice up and down before even expiration, so the volatility of the company matters greatly deciding which options structure to use!

**CONCLUSION**: Why use diagonals or slower trade on volatile ticker, when can run debt spreads capturing few trades which otherwise wouldn't have worked on slower safer companies. For example, CMG is great for diagonals imo, but Tesla would be great for debt spreads imo.",09-22-2024

"$4,000 Overnight Trading $TSLALast week, $TSLA had a major ""buy the rumor sell the news"" event after the positive China news, and right before the ""200 magnet"" was hit the bears have since been winning the battle. Looking at the 30 min chart, we can see 4 important details: 

1. Failed pushes (weak theme)
2. 179 Key Level
3. Lower Highs (textbook bearish)
4. Weaker than the SPY (not pictured)

Right now, we are in the midst of a strong market cycle, but $TSLA has been consistently weaker than the $SPY. Further, keep in mind TSLA traded higher on poor earnings AND Elon's news of slowing growth. Typically, trading against the market cycle is risky, but in this instance $TSLA was trading higher on thin air. See below for trade details:

* Entry: 1/2 size AM weakness near key level with plan to add on true Breakdown on volume or ""strength"" 
   * Added full size on ""strength"" with an average price of about $0.50
* Profit Target: Gap fill on 30 min (172)
* Risk: Failed Push reclaim (183), moved lower to 179 after Breakdown. 

For sizing, overnight trading with options can be tough because I can't exit, so I scaled with a size that I would feel comfortable with being worthless in the AM. The contracts don't always become worthless overnight, but I tell myself they will be for two reason: 

* If it happens, par for the course

"Tsla Leap AdviceWhen Tesla was trading at its 52 week low last week I bought a leap option for March 2025. After the china self driving news it jumped up to 20% of its value in just 4days since open. 

Would you just close it early and take the 20%. And wait for another entry.  The DTE is 326 days. 

Update: Thanks for all the advice. I closed my position up 20%. I‚Äôll sit on cash until I have another high conviction thesis. Like if TSLA hits a new 52 low.

IT is still not looking healthy and with a weak looking S&P I can see this continuing lower unless they can pull some magic rabbit out the hat.

At the beginning of the month we put in the the following targets‚Ä¶$152 with about 102 days to run and $103 with 133 days to run‚Ä¶I am going to refresh & run the $103 target scenario given that it was the 2023 low, to see what BB1 comes up with.

With now 116 days to go we are again NOT looking to run this trade till expiration so there isn‚Äôt much as good as there was a couple of weeks ago, however there are a couple of put flys that are worth looking at.

Just going to go for BB1‚Äôs top pick and have a little deep-dive

 buying this thing for around 94 cents INCLUDING costs would seem like a very reasonable punt although you may have to sit on it for a bit to truly monetize it

Now what that is showing is the value of a $10 wide put fly that has 116 days to expiration and is exactly $49.76 Out-the-money to show the true value of the current fly‚Ä¶.we achieve this by linear fitting the volatilities and strikes to get an exact daily value of that particular fly. In this instance it is in its 44th percentile so kinda fair value but not terrible. If you see the list BB1 still likes that 100/115 put spread too but I feel that I may have missed the boat on that as I can now only buy 37 spreads for my $1000 investment given the price increase from earlier this month.

Now I decided to go a little shorter term and had a look at potential trades with about a month to go. I DO NOT recommend swinging for a 0DTE option as they are basically a total punt and you may as well go to the racecourse. 25 days is reasonable for the market to digest and a trend to form.

Highlighting the top 6 trades here , I would opt for a 3rd on the list , the

Are you getting in for less‚Ä¶YES‚Ä¶will you make more money if your target price is correct YES‚Ä¶.can you lose your house if things totally crash‚Ä¶also Yes, which is why I shy away from these trades, especially if you‚Äôre a noob.

The point of these posts is to help show you the best option trades to do and although I personally may have a bias they are supposed to be agnostic as to direction. At the end of the day, we could see a complete turnaround and go back into the range & challenge $180 to $200 again. So I should do an upside run too.

Overall I‚Äôm very negative on the market and see especially tech as the most overvalued it‚Äôs ever been except 1999-2000.  However, people love to ignore valuations during earnings season so wanna make sure to hedge my puts with some calls until get to the other side of earnings

"Can I use this naive way to decide the strike price of my LEAPS call?Hello experts I am new to option and recently I decided to buy LEAP option because I am extremely bullish on Tesla (I think it could change how human drive cars for good).

I searched many tutorial and starts to have some naive understandings of the Greeks. However I still feel confused about what strike price to choose due to my limited knowledge and I don't have much time to accumulate first hand experience on options (I have to place my oder before the IV sky rocket)

Therefore I used a retarded method to analyze the buying point. 

I first calculate how many shares I can buy with my funding and get a share number.

Then I calculated the porfit I can get when Tesla stock price hits different values and the equation is

(Stock price - strike price) \* shares number.  

And hence I get a table (I didn't finish it) and for each target Tesla stock price I can get a best strike price.

For example if I think Tesla stock price will hit $300 2 years later then I should choose strike price $175 according to the chart. The more OTM options have bigger shares number but the (Stock price - strike price) is so small so the overall performance is worse.

Can I use this way to decide what strike price to buy if I decide to keep it until the last 3 months? (I don't have enough experience to manipulate it) 

Can I do it this way? Do I miss any important things? 

This is my biggest investment so far so I really need advice to avoid grave mistake. Thanks a lot

"The best strategy of using protective putI am very bullish on Tesla stock recently after I see the performance of FSD v12. Many says this is the chatgpt moment of FSD.  Hence I recently buy a lot of Tesla shares and even utilize margin loan (1.5 leverage, maximum 30% portfolio drawdown before liquidation).

However I have no idea how much time it actully needs for the software earning to scale up and finally makes an impact on Tesla's earning report. Before that the slow down of cars saleing and unexpected economic events can drag down the stock price and hence a risk of liquidation.

To avoid liquidation I am thinking of using protective put. There are two different strategies

**A:** buy puts with recent expiry date and roll it until the Street recognizes the impact of FSD (if that really happens)

**B:** buy put with remote expiry date and sell it after the Street recognize the impact of FSD (if that really happens)

which one is a better strategy? I am new to option and has no idea. I know there are many factors to consider like the greek letters but are there any general suggestions about this?

&#x200B;

**> inb4 why don't you buy leap call option instead**

To get profit from option you have to predict price as well as time. I have no idea when the FSD can have impact on financial data and balance out the negative factors like car sales slow down. I also have no idea about the price. Tesla's price is far more expensive than car producer and hence the FSD software n‚Äôshit has been priced in more or less. A leap call with strike price $180 expiry 2026 is like $65 and the breakeven price is around $255 per share. I'd rather keep the stock and I can always wait longer time until Elon achieves the plan.

"Sell Now or Sell 2 Years OutOk so im having some trouble debating on what I want to do so. Hear me out.

I sold a CSP late last year on Tesla where I place it super deep in the money at 300 strike. My cost per basis drop to 267 per share. Which i collected a $3,300 in premium.  


Now I want to get rid of the 100 tesla share but not sure on how to do it. I come to two possible solution.

First, I can sell 100 shares at the 100 cover call strike that exp on Feb 23, 2024 and collect $9,954 in premium. This will off set my loss of $6,820 at which point telsa is trading at 200 per share. 

\*\*\*I understand that by doing this, the person whos buying my contract at 100 per share, can openly sell those 100 shares to the open market at over $200+ per share, which will double his return. Where he can recover his $10,000 he paid me + $10,000 in profit. I will gain about  about $3,000 or so. By doing this the contract will probably be called away quickly.\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Second scenario, If I sell this cover call 2years out to Jan 16, 2026 at $5 strike. I can possible collect $19,519 in premium. \*\*\*I understand  that by doing this, the person whos buying my contract at $5 per share can open sell it to the open market in 2year time, can make over $5+, which amount that is is unknown. So if tesla is trading at 300 in 2 years, they'll make $30,000. Which they will earn 3x what they paid for. But by doing this, I'll make them wait 2 years before they can close out or let it expire.\*\*\*

"Good sources of information more important than understanding technical analysis??Hello, I have been trading options for years now and I still don‚Äôt know what I am doing. We all agree that trading options is gambling. But also I realized that nowadays I spend more time doing research on Reddit or talking on online groups than doing actual technical analysis. 

Most of my trades are %50 based on experience on how I know the stock has performed in the past (just fast glance without drawing lines or anything) and %50 based on what my friends on discord/reddit trade or have read and share. I keep track of all my trades and surprisingly without doing any kind of analysis I am still earning about $1000/month on average. I know it is not much but the simple fact that I am positive just by doing trades talking to people surprises me.

So I wanted to know the opinion of other traders on this. Do you do technical analysis? Which resources do you use to make your trades (which online platforms and groups do you use)?

 The downside trade is looking our¬† days from now, give or take ( our system will not specify an exact point unless you ask it to, because in the real world that rarely happens) with a target RANGE of $170 to $180

"Expected moves this week. Tesla, Netflix, Schwab and more.The VIX closed 19.30 on Friday and was bid most of the day. It was higher the first two hours even while the market was up on the day, an unusual occurrence, especially on a Friday. Some of that can probably be attributed to worries about the Middle East into the weekend but out-of-the-money puts are certainly being bought as hedges, with vol below the 20 delta level now above 20IV in the next two months. Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides. (they also could be completely correct and the market slow grinds higher into year-end, but the point is the VIX is not ""broken"" and still tells a story when it gets above 20).

The expected move for this week in SPY is a bit more than 1.5%. QQQ is about 2%. 0DTE expected moves in SPY has been pretty consistently near the 0.7% range, and QQQ 0DTE expected moves have been closing in on 1% a day. That's alot more than over the Summer when SPY 0DTE expected moves were consistently below a half a percent a day.

The big story on the stock front this week is earnings, with the regional banks starting to report (as well as the rest of the big Wall Street banks, and then tech reports start to heat up, led by Netflix and Tesla this week.

The one-month range in Tesla more or less lines up with the expected move for earnings this week. Here's how an Iron Condor at the expected move's breakevens line up, positioning for the chance that TSLA stays within that range following its report:

"Covered CallHi all,

I just have a quick question regarding how you could possibly lose money with covered calls.

Let's use Tesla as an example:

TSLA 10/11 Share Price: 263.00

Buy 100 shares for $26,300

Write TSLA Call 11/17 (37 days) Strike Price 285.00, 8.50

Collect $850 of premium, $850/$26,300 = 3.231% ROE for 37/365 days or 31.873% annual

If Called, TSLA > $285, contract exercised, Sell 100 TSLA shares @ $285

$28,500/$26,300 = 8.365% ROE for 37/365 days or 82.5205% annual.

If OTM, TSLA < $285, contract expires worthless. 0$.

T-bills are currently at 5.42% or .549% for 37/365 days.

I understand the obvious risk is that TSLA would decline in share price and would lose value that way, but why does it matter if it's a stock planned on keeping in my portfolio. If the contract isn't exercised, the contract could be written again next month for more passive income. I understand this strategy places a cap on the maximum rate of return, but for the average investor this makes way more logical sense to me than risk-free investments (t-bills, CDs, HYSA), (given they have the initial capital outlay to have 100 shares of a company within a diversified portfolio). I know that this is disregarding taxes that would lower these figures, but they would still be higher than risk-free investments.

Am I missing something or is this a passive income method logical?",10-11-2023
"Expected Moves this week, Oracle, Adobe, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.Qualcomm and Tesla are among the stocks powering the QQQ's higher this morning. Tesla received an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, Qualcomm is higher on news of providing 5G chips for iPhones out through 2026.

On the earnings from this week, we have Oracle today after the bell, and Adobe on Thursday. The big economic data of the week is CPI on Wednesday but we also have the ECB rate decision, US Retail Sales, and PPI on Thursday. All potentially market moving.

**Weekly Expected Moves:**

* SPY: 1.1%
* QQQ: 1.4%
* IWM: 1.4%

**Oracle Earnings**

Options are pricing about a 4.5% move. That's higher than the past 4 actual earnings moves in the stock which were 0%, -3%, -1% and -1%. One would have to assume that the reason for expectations of a larger move than recent ones center around any AI updates in the numbers and on the call. AI has breathed life into some of these old tech stocks and makes for a but more mystery on calls.

"Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings PreviewStocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.

Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.

Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6

In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:

https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee

That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.

As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year. So it's NVDA being NVDA.

"Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo AltoStocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.

Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.

A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:

Cheaper stock comparable to AppleI am looking for a stock for covered calls that functions like Apple has good stability and is on the less expensive side around $25. Any advice on how to find companies this way would be beneficial to the both of us as well so I dont have to keep asking lol. I have NIO as a Tesla alternative so far but dk how to compare a company to Apple. I know its a tech company not just a phone company but dk which direction that would lead me in,07-25-2023
"Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.* Futures lower. 
* QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25% 
* Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)

One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.

Often, expected moves line up with recent resistance and support. Here's an example in ISRG, reporting today, and an Iron Condor based on Friday's expected move that leans on a very recent low in the stock:

"Expected moves, Carvana, Goldman, Tesla, Netflix* CARVANA SOARS
* GOLDMAN DOWN 
* NETFLIX, TESLA AFTER THE CLOSE

Carvana is up an unreal 35%+ this morning after surprising the market with an early earnings report and a debt restructuring plan. This obviously caught the option market completely off guard. Options were only pricing about a 10% move for the rest of this week. But this move is even way beyond what options were pricing for Carvana's assumed reporting date, where they had the expected move at about 27%. Either way, it's difficult for options traders to properly price something moving like CVNA has been lately. It's been having regular 10% type gaps/moves and on past earnings, it's regularly moved 30%+. Options can only pump up so much to account for moves like that as traders and market makers are very wary of properly pricing them (compared to how the stock is moving) and then getting stuck with all that premium when the music stops. Here's how options were priced before the surprise:

"Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off. On the economic data front advance retail sales missed estimates this morning.

**Chart of the Day:** Netflix options are pricing about a 7.6% move, a move larger than 4 out of its last 8 earnings moves (2 moves were 20%+). A $5 wide Iron condor expiring Friday, set at the expected move would need the stock to stay between about $413 and $487 to see profits. That $413 level is pretty much the low end of the range NFLX has traded in the past month.

"Expected moves this week: Bank of America, Goldman, Netflix, Tesla and more.SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.

A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

As mentioned over the past week, we enter earnings season with some of the lowest IV we've seen in years, and expected moves for earnings the smallest we've seen in over a decade. JP Morgan options were pricing a 2.4% move, the stock is higher by 2.7% or so pre-market. Wells Fargo options were pricing about a 3% move, the stock is higher by about 3.1%. Citi options were pricing in about a 3% move and the stock is higher by about 1.6%. So options had the moves more or less correct on average, with JPM beating the expected move and Citi inside the move. As a rule of thumb about 70% of the time stocks should be at or inside the expected move on earnings. And of course, that stat is marked to the end of the day for stocks that report before the bell so the jury is still out on today. But it is something to keep a mental note of, whether we begin to see moves beyond the expected move or if options have it right, even at this low level of vol. As it could inform trade decisions, including holding positions into earnings as the vol collapse is quite different than it normally is.

Additionally, and especially as we start to hear from some tech stocks that have had a really good couple of months, are the moves to the upside the ones we see stocks beat, and are moves to the downside safer because there's an underlying bid in large parts of the market? Something to keep an eye on.

"Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event. 

It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa. Tomorrow morning we hear from the first batch of big banks, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Tech reports start to pick up next week with Netflix and Tesla two of the first big names to go.

"Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print. The expected move for SPY today is about 0.5% with the QQQ about 0.8%.

Apple's expected move over the next month is about 5%, that time period includes and earnings report.

"Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and moreStock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago. 

As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market. 

With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).

**Chart of the Day:**

NFLX options are currently pricing about an 8% move between now and the days after its earnings, a move smaller than 6 out of its last 8 actual earnings moves.

https://preview.redd.it/o6q6f7cbecab1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d454ff52d9ca2acf860c7c3d02d16a4cb5a8644",07-06-2023
"Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday. 

The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day). Options are pricing just a 10% move for the rest of the month, a potential disconnect between realized and implied.

"Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions. 

For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.

"Debit to roll up a Covered Call?So, In January I sold Covered Calls on my Tesla shares at a strike of 135 (about 30% higher than the current price at the time). The the stock soared. I have since rolled them out and up to 140, but they are out in October now. 

I've been thinking of paying a debit of $300 or so to roll them up $5 giving me a net of $200 when they are sold or if someone were to ""call"" them from me. 

Is it worth it?  Also this is another situation I got caught in where my shares are at a large loss also, but I was using the CC strategy to generate some income at the time.

Is it worth it to do as I am considering? The paper loss would be large with the calls of course, but in time (I'm guessing a year or so) they'd be close and profits could use those paper losses.

I have considered selling a put to use the premium to pay the debit to roll the CC up.

"From CAPM To Hedging\[This post uses stats 101 but can be approached with little math knowledge because it moves slowly...it builds to a set of tools for determining your hedge ratios for paired trades and aggregating deltas across an entire portfolio if you want to hedge the systemic risk with a benchmark future like ES\]

&#x200B;

 Let‚Äôs start with a question from Twitter via  patrick\_oshag

 *If you had to our your whole net worth into a single company right now (public or private), what would you pick?   Berkshire Hathaway is not allowed as an answer* 

 

This is a provocative question. Patrick was clever to disallow Berkshire. In this post, we are going to use this question to launch into the basics of regression, correlation, beta hedging and risk.

Let‚Äôs begin.

## My Reaction To The Questionüì∑

I don‚Äôt know anything about picking stocks. I do know about the nature of stocks which makes this question scary. Why?

1. Stocks don‚Äôt last foreverMany stocks go to zero. The distribution of many stocks is positively skewed which means there‚Äôs a small chance of them going to the moon and reasonable chance that they go belly-up. The price of a stock reflects its mathematical expectation. Since the downside is bounded by zero and the upside is infinite, for the expectation to balance the probability of the stock going down can be much higher than our flawed memories would guess. Stock indices automatically rebalance, shedding companies that lose relevance and value. So the idea that stocks up over time is really stock *indices* go up over a time, even though individual stocks have a nasty habit of going to zero. For more see [*Is There Actually An Equity Premium Puzzle?*](https://moontowermeta.com/is-there-actually-an-equity-premium-puzzle/).
2. Diversification is the only free lunchThe first point hinted at my concern with the question. I want to be diversified. Markets do not pay you for non-systematic risk. In other words, you do not get paid for risks that you can hedge. All but the most fundamental risks can be hedged with diversification. See [*Why You Don‚Äôt Get Paid For Diversifiable Risks*](https://moontowermeta.com/why-you-dont-get-paid-for-diversifiable-risks/). To understand how diversifiable risks get arbed out of the market ask yourself who the most efficient holder of a particular idiosyncratic risk is? If it‚Äôs not you, then you are being outbid by someone else, or you‚Äôre holding the risk at a price that doesn‚Äôt make sense given your portfolio choices. Read [*You Don‚Äôt See The Whole Picture*](https://moontowermeta.com/you-dont-see-the-whole-picture/) to see why.

My concerns reveal why Berkshire would be an obvious choice. Patrick ruled it out to make the question much harder. Berkshire is a giant conglomerate. Many would have chosen it because it‚Äôs run by masterful investors Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. But I would have chosen it because it‚Äôs diversified. It is one of the closest companies I could find to an equity index. Many people look at the question and think about where their return is going to be highest. I have no edge in that game. Instead, I want to minimize my risk by diversifying and accepting the market‚Äôs compensation for accepting broad equity exposure.

In a sense, this question reminds me of an interview question I‚Äôve heard.

*You are gifted $1,000,000 dollars. You must put it all in play on a roulette wheel. What do you do?*

The roulette wheel has negative edge no matter what you do. Your betting strategy can only alter the distribution. You can be crazy and bet it all on one number. Your expectancy is negative but the payoff is positively skewed‚Ä¶you probably lose your money but have a tiny chance at becoming super-rich. You can try to play it safe by risking your money on most of the numbers, but that is still negative expectancy. The skew flips to negative. You probably win, but there‚Äôs a small chance of losing most of your gifted cash.

I would choose what‚Äôs known as a *minimax* strategy which seeks to minimize the maximum loss. I would spread my money evenly on all the numbers, accept a sure loss of 5.26%.[1](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5236) The minimax response to Patrick‚Äôs question is to find the stock that is the most internally diversified.

## Berkshire Vs The Marketüì∑

I don‚Äôt have an answer to Patrick‚Äôs question. Feel free to explore the speculative responses in the thread. Instead, I want to dive further into my gut reaction that Berkshire would be a reasonable proxy to the market. If we look at the mean of its [annual returns](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2021ltr.pdf) from 1965 to 2001, the numbers are gaudy. Its CAGR was 26.6% vs the SP500 at 11%. Different era. Finding opportunities at the scale Buffet needs to move the needle has been much harder in the past 2 decades.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zfqfg4c8zy8b1.png?width=253&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1b304927889c03d6e33536fd2480921543fec73

&#x200B;

 

Buffet has been human for the past 20 years. This is a safer assumption than the hero stats he was putting up in the last half of the 20th century.¬†

The mean arithmetic returns and standard deviations validate my hunch that Berkshire‚Äôs size and diversification [2](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5236) make it behave like the whole market in a single stock.¬†

Let‚Äôs add a scatterplot with a regression.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ct6ujfx9zy8b1.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d17d0dd8275d198ca3197bb624c98afe1a9a6b

 

f you tried to anticipate Berkshire‚Äôs return, your best guess might be its past 20 year return, distributed similarly to its prior volatility. Another approach would be to see this relationship to the SP500 and notice that a portion of its return can simply be explained by the market. It clearly has a positive correlation to the SP500. But just how much of the relationship is explained by SP500? This is a large question with practical applications. Specifically, it underpins how market netural traders think about hedges. If I hedge an exposure to Y with X how much risk do I have remaining? To answer this question we will go on a little learning journey:

1. Deriving sensitivities from regressions in general
2. Interpreting the regression
3. CAPM: Applying regression to compute the ‚Äúrisk remaining of a hedge‚Äù

On this journey you can expect to learn the difference between beta and correlation, build intuition for how regressions work, and see how market exposures are hedged.¬†

## Unpacking The Berkshire Vs SP500 Regressionüì∑

A regression is simply a model of how an independent variable influences a dependant variable. Use a regression when you believe there is a causal relationship between 2 variables. Spurious correlations are correlations that will appear to be causal because they can be tight. The regression math may even suggest that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôm sorry. Math is a just a tool. It requires judgement. The sheer number of measurable quanitites in the world guarantees an infinite list of correlations that serve as humor not insight[3](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5236).

The SP500 is steered by the corporate earnings of the largest public companies (and in the long-run the Main Street economy[4](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5236)) discounted by some risk-aware consensus. Berkshire is big and broad enough to inherit the same drivers. We accept that Berkshire‚Äôs returns are partly driven by the market and partly due to its own idiosyncracies.

Satisfied that some of Berkshire‚Äôs returns are attributable to the broader market, we can use regression to understand the relationship. In the figure above, I had Excel simply draw a line that best fit the scatterplot with SP500 being the independent variable, or X, and Berkshire returns being the dependant or Y. The best fit line (there are many kinds of regression but we are using a simple linear regression) is defined the same way in line is: by a slope and an intercept.¬†

The regression equation should remind you of the generic form of a line y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the intercept.¬†

In a regression:

**y=Œ±+Œ≤x**

where:

y = dependant variable (Berkshire returns)

x = independent variable (SP500 returns)

Œ± = the intercept (a constant)

Œ≤ = the slope or sensitivity of the Y variable based on the X variable

If you right-click on a scatterplot in Excel you can choose ‚ÄúAdd Trendline‚Äù. It will open the below menu where you can set the fitted line to be linear and also check a box to ‚ÄúDisplay Equation on chart‚Äù.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zqi7y5wbzy8b1.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddceb144a7c583bcd5e7416c8124a90044cce499

 

This is how I found the slope and intercept for the Berkshire chart:

y = .6814x + .0307

Suppose the market returns 2%:

Predicted Berkshire return = .6814 \* 2% + 3.07%

Predicted Berkshire return = 4.43%

So based on actual data, we built a simple model of Berkshire‚Äôs returns as a function of the market.¬†

It‚Äôs worth slowing down to understand how this line is being created. Conceptually it is the line that minimizes the squared errors between itself and the actual data. Since each point has 2 coordinates, we are dealing with the variance of a joint distribution. We use covariance instead of variance but the concepts are analogous. With variance we square the deviations from a mean. For covariance, we multiply the distance of each X and Y in a coordinate from their respective means: **(x·µ¢ ‚Äì xÃÑ)(y·µ¢ -yÃÑ)**

Armed with that idea, we can compute the regression line by hand with the following formulas:

**Œ≤ or slope = covar(x,y)/ var(x)**

**Œ± or intercept = yÃÑ ‚Äì Œ≤ÃÑxÃÑ**

We will look at the full table of this computation later to verify Excel‚Äôs regression line. Before we do that, let‚Äôs make sure that this model is even helpful. One standard we could use to determine¬† if the model is useful is if it performs better than the cheapest naive model that says:

Our predicted Berkshire return simply is mean return from sample.

This green arrows in this picture represent the error between this simple model and the actual returns.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/as1p2cjdzy8b1.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e2b9cb1add48164c95ff5e3e6df447c339148d5

 

This naive model of summing the squared differences from the mean of Berkshire‚Äôs returns is exactly the same as variance. You are computing squared differences from a mean. If you take square root of the average of the squared differences you get a standard deviation. In, this simple model where our prediction is simply the mean our volatility is 16.5% or the volatility of Berkshire‚Äôs returns for 20 years.¬†

In the regression context, the total variance of the dependent variable from its mean is knows as the **Total Sum of Squares** or **TSS**.¬†

The point of using regression though is we can make a better prediction of Berkshire‚Äôs returns if we know the SP500‚Äôs returns. So we can compare the mean to the fitted line instead of the actual returns. The sum of those squared differences is known as the **Regression Sum Of Squares** or **RSS**. This is the sum of squared deviations between the mean and fitted predictions instead of the actual returns. If there is tremendous overlap between the RSS and TSS, than we think much of the variance in X explains the variance of Y.

The last quantity we can look at is the **Error Sum of Squares** or **ESS**. These are the deviations from the actual data to the predicted values represented by our fitted line. This represents the unexplained portion of Y‚Äôs variance.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1rffmi3fzy8b1.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=30b052be4c4675c1ed2b15eb13c0048adb100960

 

Let‚Äôs use 2008‚Äôs giant negative return to show how TSS, RSS, and ESS relate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa0wf9hgzy8b1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f243231dd10421f7ead8914e2536309ea0520cd0

 

The visual shows:

**TSS = RSS + ESS**

We can compute the sum of these squared deviations simply from their definitions:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4qfntajzy8b1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=5330715f05b291ae494034c65e747e19c43e0359

 

The only other quantities we need are variances and covariances to compute Œ≤ or slope of the regression line.¬†

In the table below:

≈∑ = the predicted value of Berkshire‚Äôs return aka ‚Äúy-hat‚Äù

xÃÑ = mean SP500 return aka ‚Äúx-bar‚Äù

yÃÑ = mean Berkshire return aka ‚Äúy-bar‚Äù

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hg9cedokzy8b1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=17001f458cb11098cb00ee07cf923e9a98678aa0

&#x200B;

¬† **Œ≤ = .40 / .59 = .6814**

¬† **Œ± = yÃÑ ‚Äì Œ≤ÃÑxÃÑ = 10.6% ‚Äì .6814 \* 11.1% = 3.07%**

This yields the same regression equation Excel spit out:

**y=Œ±+Œ≤x**

**≈∑ = 3.07% + .6814x**

## R-Squaredüì∑

We walked through this slowly as a learning exercise, but the payoff is appreciating the R¬≤. Excel computed it as 52%. But we did everything we need to compute it by hand. Go back to our different sum of squares.

TSS or variance of Y = .52

ESS or sum of squared difference between actual data and the model = .25

Re-arranging TSS = RSS + ESS we can see that RSS = .27

Which brings us to:

**R¬≤ = RSS/TSS = .27/.52 = 52%**¬†

Same as Excel!

R¬≤ is the regression sum of squares divided by the total variance of Y. It is called the *coefficient of determination* and can be interpreted as:

**The variability in Y explained by X**

So based on this small sample, 52% of Berkshire‚Äôs variance is explained by the market, as proxied by the SP500.¬†

## Correlationüì∑

Correlation, r (or if you prefer Greek, œÅ) can be computed in at least 2 ways. It‚Äôs the square root of R¬≤.

**r = ‚àöR¬≤ = ‚àö.52 = .72**

We can confirm this by computing correlation by hand according to its own formula:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30x0p5dozy8b1.png?width=177&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1aaf9777579657db3fddc98882675a225a8b195

 Substituting: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nj1smpmpzy8b1.png?width=346&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c8a205d29e0c6fac9a4dd92fbd1e11e46afda1

 

Looking at the table above we have all the inputs:

**r = .40 / sqrt(.59 x .52)**

**r = .72**

Variance is an unintuitive number. By taking the square root of variance, we arrive at a standard deviation which we can actually use.

Similarly, covariance is an intermediate computation lacking intuition. By normalizing it (ie dividing it) by the standard deviations of X and Y we arrive at correlation, a measure that holds meaning to us. It is bounded by -1 and +1. If the correlation is .72 then we can make the following statement:

***If x is 1 standard deviation above its mean, I expect y to be .72 standard deviations above its own mean.***

It is a normalized measure of how one variable co-varies versus the other.¬†

## How Beta And Correlation Relateüì∑

Beta, Œ≤, is the slope of the regression equation.

Correlation is the square root of R2 or coefficient of determination.

Beta actually embeds correlation within it.

Look closely at the formulas:

Whoa.

***Beta equals correlation times the ratio of the standard deviations.***¬†

The significance of that insight is about to become clear as we move from our general use of regression to the familiar CAPM regression. From the CAPM formula we can derive the basis of hedge ratios and more!

We have done all the heavy lifting at this point. The reward will be a set of simple, handy formulas that have served me throughout my trading career.

Let‚Äôs continue.

## From Regression To CAPM¬†üì∑

The famous CAPM pricing equation is a simple linear regression stipulating that the return of an asset is a function of the risk free rate, a beta to the broader market, plus an error term that represents the security‚Äôs own idiosyncratic risk.¬†

**R·µ¢ = R’¢ + Œ≤(R‚Çò ‚Äì R’¢) + E·µ¢**

where:

R·µ¢ = security total return

R’¢ = risk-free rate

Œ≤ = sensitivity of security‚Äôs return to the overall market‚Äôs excess return (ie the return above the risk-free rate)

E·µ¢ = the security‚Äôs unique return (aka the error or noise term)

Since the risk-free rate is a constant, let‚Äôs scrap it to clean the equation up.

 

This is the variance equation for this security:

Recall that beta is the vol ratio \* correlation:

We can use this to factor the ‚Äúmarket variance‚Äù term.

Plugging this form of ‚Äúvariance due to the market‚Äù back into the variance equation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2p7qsn20z8b1.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=860604ff025999eca2a708eabbe01010faafec7d

 

This reduces to the prized equation: The ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù formula which is the proportion of a stock‚Äôs volatility due to its own idiosyncratic risk.¬†

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/92tpep840z8b1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=b171be3eb8e57a3fbaf2fb8571031d8e066a12d9

 

This makes sense. R2 is the amount of variance in a dependant variable attributable to indepedent variable. If we subtract that proportion from 1 we arrive at the ‚Äúunexplained‚Äù or idiosyncratic variance. By taking the square root of that quantity, we are left with unexplained volatility or ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù.¬†

Let‚Äôs use what we‚Äôve learned in a concrete example.

## From CAPM To Hedge Ratiosüì∑

Let‚Äôs return to Berkshire vs the SP500. Suppose we are long $10mm worth of BRK.B and want to hedge our exposure by going short SP500 futures.¬†

We want to compute:

1. How many dollars worth of SP500 to get short
2. The ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù on the hedged portfolio

**How many dollars of SP500 do we need to short?**  


Before we answer this lets consider a few ways we can hedge with SP500.¬†

* *Dollar weighting*  
We could simply sell $10mm worth of SP500 futures which corresponds to our $10mm long in BRK.B. Since Berkshire and the SP500 are a similar volatility this is a reasonable approach. But suppose we were long TSLA instead of BRK.B. Assuming TSLA was sufficiently correlated to the market (say .70 like BRK.B), the SP500 hedge would be ‚Äútoo light‚Äù.¬†  
Why?¬†  
Because TSLA is about 3x more volatile than the SP500. If the SP500 fell 1 standard deviation, we expect TSLA to fall .70 standard deviations. Since TSLA‚Äôs standard deviations are much larger than the SP500 we would be tragically underhedged. Our TSLA long would lose much more money than our short SP500 position because we are not short enough dollars of SP500.¬†  

* *Vol weighting*  
Dollar weighting is clearly naive if there are large differences in volatility between our long and short. Let‚Äôs stick with the TSLA example. If TSLA is 3x as volatile as the SP500 then if we are long $10mm TSLA, we need to short $30mm worth of SP500.  
Uh oh.¬†  
That‚Äôs going to be too much. Remember the correlation. It‚Äôs only .70. The pure vol weighted hedge only makes sense if the correlations are 1. If the SP500 drops one standard deviation, we expect TSLA to drop only .70 standard deviations, not a full standard deviation. In this case, we will have made too much money on our hedge, but if the market would have rallied 1 standard deviation our oversized short would have been ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. We would lose more money than we gained on our TSLA long. Again, only partially hedged.¬†  

* *Beta weighting*  
Alas, we arrive at the goldilocks solution. We use the beta or slope of the linear regression to weight our hedge. Since beta equals correlation \* vol ratio we are incorporating both vol and correlation weighting into our hedge!¬†  
I made up numbers vols and correlations to complete the summary tables below. The key is seeing how much the prescribed hedge ratios can vary depending on how you weight the trades.¬†

  


https://preview.redd.it/p8ujhzo60z8b1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf5cf8298fa8153b1fce52979fb8a762d44418e8

 

* Beta weighting accounts for both relative volatilies and the correlation between names. Beta has a one-to-many relationship to its construction. A beta of .5 can come from:  

   * A .50 correlation but equal vols
   * A .90 correlation but vol ratio of .56
   * A .25 correlation but vol ratio of 2

It‚Äôs important to decompose betas because the correlation portion is what determines the ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù on a hedge. Let‚Äôs take a look.¬†

**How much risk remains on our hedges?**

We are long $10,000,000 of TSLA

We sell $21,000,000 of SP500 futures as a beta-weighted hedge.¬†

Risk remaining is the volatility of TSLA that is unexplained by the market.

* R2 is the amount of variance in the TSLA position explained by the market.¬†
* 1-R2 is the amount of variance that remains unexplained
* The vol remaining is sqrt(1-R2)

Risk (or vol) remaining = sqrt (1-.72) = 51%

TSLA annual volatility is 45% so the risk remaining is 51% \* 45% = 22.95%

22.95% of $10,0000 of TSLA = $2,295,000

So if you ran a hedged position, within 1 standard deviation, you still expect $2,295,000 worth of noise!

Remember correlation is symmetrical. The correlation of A to B is the same as the correlation of B to A (you can confirm this by looking at the formula).¬†

**Beta is not symmetrical because it‚Äôs correlation \* œÉdependant /** **œÉindependent**¬†

Yet risk remaining only depends on correlation.¬†

So what happens if we flipped the problem and tried to hedge $10,000,000 worth of SP500 with a short TSLA position.

1. First, this is conceptually a more dangerous idea. Even though the correlation is .70, we are less likely to believe that TSLA‚Äôs variance explains the SP500‚Äôs variance. Math without judgement will impale you on a spear of overconfidence.¬†  

2. I‚Äôll work through the example just to be complete.¬†  
To compute beta we flip the vol ratio from 3 to 1/3 then multiply by the correlation of .7  
Beta of SP500 to TSLA is .333 \* .7 = .233  
If we are long $10,000,000 of SP500, we sell $2,333,000 of TSLA. The risk remaining is still 51% but it is applied to the SP500 volatility of 15%.¬†  
51% x 15% = 7.65% so we expect 7.65% of $10,000,000 or $765,000 of the SP500 position to be unexplained by TSLA.¬†  

3. I‚Äôm re-emphasizing: math without judgement is a recipe for disaster. The formulas are tools, not substitutes for reasoning.¬†

**Changes in Correlation Have Non-Linear Effects On Your Risk**

Hedging is tricky. You can see that risk remaining explodes rapidly as correlation falls.

***If correlation is as high as .86, you already have 50% risk remaining!***

 

In practice, a market maker may:

1. group exposures to the most related index (they might have NDX, SPX, and IWM buckets for example)
2. offset deltas between exposures as they accumulate
3. and hedge the remaining deltas with futures.¬†

You might create risk tolerances that stop you from say being long $50mm worth of SPX and short $50mm of NDX leaving you exposed the underlying factors which differentiate these indices. Even though they might be tightly correlated intraday, the correlation change over time and your risk-remaining can begin to swamp your edge.¬†  


The point of hedging is to neutralize the risks you are not paid to take. But hedging is costly. Traders must always balance these trade-offs in the context of their capital, risk tolerances, and changing correlations.¬†

## Reviewüì∑

I walked slowly through topics that are familiar to many investors and traders. I did this because the grout in these ideas often trigger an insight or newfound clarity of something we thought we understood.¬†

This is a recap of important ideas in this post:

* Variance is a measure of dispersion for a single distribution. Covariance is a measure of dispersion for a joint distribution.
* Just as we take the square root of variance to normalize it to something useful (standard deviation, or in a finance context ‚Äî volatility), we normalize covariance into correlation.
* Intuition for a positive(negative) correlation: if X is N standard deviations above its mean, Y is r \* N standard deviations above(below) its mean.¬†
* Beta is r \* the vol ratio of Y to X. In a finance context, it allows it allows us to convert a correlation from a standard deviation comparison to a simple elasticity. If beta = 1.5, then if X is up 2%, I expect Y to be up 3%
* Correlation is symmetrical. Beta is not.¬†
* R2¬†is the variance explained by the independent variable. Risk remaining is the volatility that remains unexplained. It is equal to¬†sqrt(1-R2).¬†
* There is a surprising amount of risk remaining even if correlations are strong. At a correlation of .86, there is 50% unexplained variance!
* Don‚Äôt compute robotically. Reason > formulas.¬†

Beware.

Least squares linear regression is only one method for fitting a line. It only works for linear relationships. Its application is fraught with pitfalls. It‚Äôs important to understand the assumptions in any models you use before they become load-bearing beams in your process.¬†",06-29-2023
"Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQFutures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.

"Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.

This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP & Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open.

"Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word ""stubborn"" inflation by now but the ""stubborn"" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is ""pausing"" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close. That's about 10 vol.

**Chart of the Day:**

Tesla stock is up around 70% in the past 2 months yet options are only pricing about a 20% move for the rest of the Summer. Options rarely get this name right when it makes big rips higher.

"Strategy for selling options ?If I sell Tesla put options at 270 strike price and it did not hit 270 by the time it expired, it will be auto execised and I will need to buy 100 Tesla Shares at 270. 

What would be the best case to mitigate risk ? 


Should I just cut loss before it even get exercise or should I sell covered calls at maybe 275 strike price ? 


My reasoning is If it hits 275, I am obligated to sell to you at 275 USD, which I make a small profit since I am buying at 270. 

If it continues goes down or move sideway, I can collect my premium to narrow down the losses as well.

Is it a good strategy like should I go with selling calls if it gets exercise or should I just buyback to narrow my losses and continue to sell puts to earn back from premium",06-22-2023
"Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIXFutures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks. 

As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how ""cheap"" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.

"Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**

SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.

**This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**

SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.

A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.

The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.

So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.

E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.

*Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.

"Fidelity closing Options earlyTwo weeks ago, I had losing trades with Tesla where I had sold PUTs at 185 and bought Puts at 180 to define the risk.

When I logged on with 1/2 hr to go, I found that Fidelity had closed me out 1 full hour early.  I've asked why they did this in advance but have gotten no message back.  Is anybody aware of some rule that requires you to be out a full hour in advance if the trade is a loser?  The closeouts occurred exactly at 3PM eastern.

"Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì Another positive week and an IV collapse.**

SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.

**This Week ‚Äì A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**

SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn‚Äôt necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.

Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):

Via the Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).

Earnings are really light this week but pick up in the second half of April. Next week some of the banks report, with Citi and Wells Fargo late in the week, then things really heat up the week of April 17th with Schwab, Goldman and Bank of America followed by Netflix and Tesla. The week of April 24th sees the big tech names like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet etc.

Risk Free option. Dumb or should I have just taken the moneyI currently have a risk free play on. I bought 4/6 $190 Tesla put for 11.25 yesterday around noon.

"OTM Call Optimal Strike PriceThis is a simulated trade only. 

However, I noticed that the leverage effect for the strike price at 250 is the greatest. 

I bought calls when the share is around $120. Why didn't the far out OTM call give the highest leverage in this case? Is it to assume that the return is the highest, if the share price is closest to the strike price of the call, in this case 250? I always thought the deep OTM call could give the highest return if the stock goes in the right direction. It doesn't look like that though. What am I missing here?

Same question maybe ask differently, if you knew where the stock is heading, which call would you buy then to achieve the max return?

"TSLA Covered Call ITM SuggestionsHello,

I could use some input here and opinion on my strategy.

I have a covered call on my Tesla shares. Back in Jan I rolled it to 130 strike(back when stock was $108) with expire in April. Well, Tesla has popped huge. So I have a few choices I see to do here: oh, and my avg purchase price for the shares was $350 so there is a loss there.  

I've made cash rolling this option so far of about $3k

1. Hold the option awhile longer and see how it goes. Premium is high enough no one may execute it.
2. Roll the option out to June up to $140 strike that would cost me about $500. Although it would result in an extra $500 gain on those shares if it executed. Rolling it however results in a $8k or so paper loss. Which may not matter since later I see if the stock falls and it becomes a gain at some point.
3. Roll the option out 3 months to get more cash out and raise strike.
4. Hold another month and roll in March.

I've only been trading options like this for 2 years and overall have made money. I'd rather not lose my Tesla shares since they move up and down a lot.

I also have 2 other covered calls in my IRA in a similar situation.

really appreciate and learn from all comments.",02-15-2023

"FAANG set to move higher, mid-caps into resistance. Net options sentiment & GEX may be moving stocksThe market saw a glorious rebound this week potentially fueled by gamma-imbalances forcing dealers into buy-side pressure. Stocks squeezed higher before reverting slightly back down to the mean on Friday.

&#x200B;

Funds have been keeping their dry powder tight, but the tide could be changing as institutions start ‚Äúloading the boat‚Äù, per say. Big tech such as AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, et al have been lagging in the rallies as of late, but the data is now telling a different story ([screenshots from the ProsperoAI app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)). Here‚Äôs a look at net institutional inflows.

https://preview.redd.it/ut309u5zddga1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf84941f726b2e6b91bb4c5ad6c3e367f769403d

&#x200B;

A glance back at Tesla from prior weeks had net options sentiment at elevated levels for some time, the share price followed suit with a move to the upside.

https://preview.redd.it/vwiks3a0edga1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=39dc4de4271b77635a322d7267382fc2cbc03f1e

&#x200B;

The Tesla rally my have been triggered with the perfect storm of net institutional inflow and net options sentiment. The option activity and net options sentiment may be telling us where the market will head next.

https://preview.redd.it/1c7a5z11edga1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=5013d346f477411160235649d63df62c850b050b

&#x200B;

The market has been wonky and gamma exposure seems to be the catalyst with this volatile move up. IMO we should keep an eye on option flow and let it guide the way for the next move in either direction. A drop in bullish sentiment may give room for the market to take a breather after the leg up we just saw in January.

&#x200B;

Two other names I‚Äôm seeing some of the option flow turn to the downside (and possibly push the stock back to the mean) are in GPS (Gap) and MDB (MongoDB). Both of these names saw rather large moves in the last 5 days (over 20% to upside), with MDB already giving some of those gains back.

&#x200B;

GPS showing low values in institutional flow, options sentiment and also social sentiment, but rather high risk on downside breakout. This could lead to more volatility in not just GPS, but more mid-cap names as well.

https://preview.redd.it/ydf9rzr1edga1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ff433a1318e9c52faaedc03e19a02d263c9f35e

&#x200B;

MDB was showing a similar pattern to what was found in Tesla not long ago. Elevated net options sentiment for some time followed by increase in share price. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see more downside (already 15% reversal last week) should some of the option flow change rapidly with the rest of the market.

# Summary

The slight increase in the downward trend of net options sentiment may be a sign of a bull trap. Although the VIX remains somewhat unchanged (weird), volatility and wide swings in share price are back on the menu. Thus option flow and net options sentiment may play a significant role in guiding us where the market wants to go next. IMO I am cautiously optimistic the market has found a long-term bottom and we may start to trend higher while seeing periods of volatility at the same time, like we did this week.

"TSLA Overview Pre Earnings CallTesla earnings call is tomorrow Jan 25th. The Street has a love hate relationship with Elon, TSLA has taken a beating for a couple of months, but showed signs of recovery in the last week. This is how things look at the moment in the options market expiring on Jan 27:

* TSLA momentum has been moving upwards since last week. Now, we have crossed the 80th percentile. We have had a momentum this strong since last July/August, which makes sense because TSLA just hit a bottom two weeks ago.

* The options market is generally biased towards calls over puts, which signals a bullish sentiment

* The next major resistance level is at strike $150, there is a massive build up of almost 10K new contracts added to this strike since yesterday. Yesterday's OI is denoted by the blue dots.

"Expected Moves This Week, Tesla, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Boeing, and more.## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì Late rally saves the week.**

SPY was lower by about 0.6% last week but ended on a strong note with a near 2% rally off its lows of the week on Thursday. The move on the week was inside the 1.3% move options were pricing. The VIX ended thr week unchanged as did near-term IV, with SPY options still in the low to mid-teens for the next two weeks. Things change the first week of February as we hear from the FOMC and see the latest employment and inflation data. Those weeks have consistently seen higher IV across the market, looking almost like a monthly earnings report on the expected move chart (Feb 3rd IV highlighted, note the bulge in the expected move chart for that week):

&#x200B;

**This Week ‚Äì Again, relatively Low IV into this week‚Äôs earnings**.

Last week we highlighted how market vol is low compared to what we‚Äôve seen over the past year, and that low vol has arrived as earnings season heats up. That means we may continue to see examples of options pricing earnings moves lower than typical moves in the same stock over the past year. Last week, we highlighted Goldman Sachs (GS), a stock that had risen 6% the week before on the heels of the positive CPI reaction and earnings from JP Morgan. Despite that move into earnings, options were only pricing a 2.6% move for the actual earnings report. Goldman of course missed, and the stock was down nearly 9% on the week. This is something to be aware of around upcoming earnings. One way to gut-check where current vol is versus historical averages is to look at the realized 250 (trading days) stat versus the IV for this week. Last week, we highlighted the fact that GS options were about 25 IV for earnings, yet the stock had traded at about 29 IV for the past year. That was a red-flag that turned out to be prescient.

Looking at some of the big names reporting this week, we see MSFT options 41 IV versus about 36 realized vol for the past year. So MSFT options are pricing a move for earnings slightly more than an average week (but not by much). TSLA options are similar, 81 IV this week versus 67 realized the past year. INTC options stick out as quite pumped versus the past year. IV for this week is 67 versus 39 realized for the past year. INTC has actually moved a lot on its recent earnings, with moves of +10%, -9%, -7%, and 7% (with the +10% most recent). That helps explain this week‚Äôs 7% expected move.

So looking at those 3 examples, there are none that are as low as the situation we saw last week in GS, but among the three MSFT options are the cheapest versus last year‚Äôs realized and INTC‚Äôs are the most expensive, needing a move similar to what the stock saw its past 4 earnings in order for options to not have been overpriced. As an example of a neutral trade, selling that earnings move, an Iron Condor expiring this Friday in INTC would currently need the stock to close the week between 26.80 and 31.20 following its report to see max gain. Here‚Äôs how that looks on a 3-month stock chart (see [this trade ](https://tools.optionsai.com/strategies/INTC/iron-condor)and others on Options AI‚Äôs free trade tool):

"Markets RIP on Friday w/ net options sentiment shifting to the upside. Gamma squeeze incoming?Markets closed Friday with a sharp rip to the upside. Call option activity and net option sentiment has been slowly increasing and making a major shift into positive territory.

The market (SPY) has been in a tight range for the last 6 weeks with the light volume over the holidays. In regards to the QQQ, but also the general market, there are two things I am looking at:

* The market has been range-bound for roughly 6 weeks with no clear direction.
* We are back at the June 2021 lows, nearly 7 months of no returns.

I‚Äôve market both levels on the chart below.

https://preview.redd.it/i1ri1jwcntaa1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=30557e850b489da111515be1bc63c383acffb719

&#x200B;

This leads me to believe the charts are suggesting a short-term bottom and an entry with a favorable risk-reward may be approaching, depending on your time-frame of course.

Furthermore, there‚Äôs an increase in net positive option buying that‚Äôs been going on under the hood of the market. [Chart courtesy of the Prospero App.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)

&#x200B;

The SPY average net options sentiment values have been steadily climbing since December. This comes after the large drop that occurred going into the holiday break.

Similarly, the QQQ was not too far off from the SPY which also showed a steady increase (although more volatile) in [net options sentiment activity.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)

*Processing img 5hwlpe59xtaa1...*

China stocks have been hammered and BABA was another name showing similar patterns of increasing options positioning, this time to the upside. Here's a look at the longer time-frame from back in October when the share price also happened to bottom at -75% from the high. Net buyers of options have been able to push the share price up nearly 55% since then.

*Processing img r7ra1ydaxtaa1...*

&#x200B;

Lastly, a look at retail‚Äôs favorite stock, Tesla. The share price is down 70% from the highs and retail has been getting hammered on this name over the last 6 months. Positive options sentiment reaching near the top of the charts with the stock nearing the lows.

*Processing img yvhv1jdbxtaa1...*

&#x200B;

In my opinion once the sellers have stopped and liquidity dries up we may be seeing some sharp moves upward. This will also come at the expense of more volatility (low liquidity), but makes me wonder if the big players are setting themselves up for the market to squeeze higher.

"High IV Alert: Tesla (TSLA)Tesla continues to get battered by the market. ARKK predicted that by 2026 Tesla would be selling 17m cars per year and 5m cars in the worst case scenario. Whether Chief Twit can pull this off is not of my concern. I am only focusing on the overall feel of the market towards the once untouchable TSLA. This analysis is for Options expiring on Friday January 6th, 2023.

* TSLA continues to have a steady positive outlook, based on a bias towards CALLS over PUTS, however, the market isn't as bullish as it was prior to 12/27 (image 1)
* All OTM strikes have over 100% IV, this means that the market is fairly indecisive about the direction of the moves but expects the moves to be of significant size. (image 2)
* There are two medium resistance levels at $120 and $125, and a massive resistance point at $130 (image3)
* Massive support level at $100, with the price being around $108, there is not much room left to go down. (image 4)
* $1B is needed to completely a delta hedge up to strike $130, this makes it very unlikely that the price will go above that.(image 5)
* Strike $120 is currently delta hedged by 160K units of Tesla (or equivalents) in case this strike isn't surpassed by Friday, expect these hedges to be redeployed, creating more downward pressure. (image 6)
* Strike $118 and above have a probability of profit for sellers of 80% or more.

"Wash Sale for OptionsQuestions about taxes for this year.

Let's say I started with $5000 in my portfolio. I made $3000 in a stock and realized that and no longer touched that stock (protfolio = $8000). Then, I bought options of Tesla worth the $8000 and sold at a loss of $4000 (-50%). Then, the next day I bought Tesla options again and gained $100 after selling. I then bought spy options for $4000 and sold for a loss of $2000. I then bought spy options again and sold for a loss of $1000, so my account now has $900 from the initial $5000 deposit.

"Option price the night before expirationHi,

I started trading options recently, taking advantage of this volatile and surprisingly predictable market. It worked out quite well until today. After buying SPY puts on the successfully in the morning, I took profit and then I saw Tesla, that was coming from its early crash and turned to be positive. I was quite profitable multiple time but I didn't manage the all my position, and I have an open position with 20 12/16 156.67 PUT at $2.4.

Since this is the first time it happens to me. I was like shit, I will get fucked by the Theta and in the morning I will lose a decent amount. The closing price was $2.02, and I check on OptionStrat and the theoretical price tomorrow morning should be around 0.9 (haha‚Ä¶ you can make fun of me).


BUT a question raised, since options don't trade at night, and because of the time decay effect, shouldn't the theoretical price at close be the same than the price at the next day open? This being true when theta becomes more important than Delta.

By the way, another question, the strike price of this specific option is quite funny, 157.67‚Ä¶ any reason for that?

Tesla resisted very well, strong support throughout the day, I plan to sell early in the morning tomorrow, because I see no chance to end up ITM, any thoughts?

Thanks

Edit: thank you for your answers, well I think IV is one of the explanation here. What a rollercoaster this morning! Opening at $0.8, I closed the position at $1.8... it went up to $2.5! I didn't have the gut to keep it opened any longer. Won't touch this type of thing until I have a better understand of the beast :-)

Edit2: I missed a fuck*ng opportunity, price is $3.7 now. Holy cow! :-) I guess it's a matter of conviction and it was not strong enough.",12-16-2022

P/E Excl. Extra Items (TTM)     0.51

Price To Sales (TTM)                 0.21

Price To Book (Quarterly)        0.51

Shipping pricing has gone down by quite a bit for all things non oil+LNG.

However, despite the revenue drop the earnings are still positive.

It looks to me like this stock is valued as if half of its ships sank.

I have been buying some but it is less than 1% of my portfolio.

The next date where one would need to own the stock to receive the dividend (the Ex dividend date) is 

Monday 11/28/22

Is there any other news that would explain a stock being down to this extreme?

Other thoughts?

Short sellers have to pay the dividend, though the stock price adjusts to the dividend payout

(the market pushes down the price in accordance with the cash the company spent on the dividend)",11-21-2022
"QQQ has broken the 50 SMA, back in bullish territory? Looking at beaten names: TSLA, SQ, CRWD, PYPLWhat a strong finish to the week while most tech & growth names followed through above their 50-day simple moving average (SMA), circled in orange.

https://preview.redd.it/l6cxg36x0qz91.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f039a5fa9ef395ee94087c8b1d7b63115158b8d

Trends aren‚Äôt guaranteed indicators, but a follow through of this particular trend would be bullish for stocks. Since this is a mid-range trend indicator, it may be somewhat more sustainable than looking at the 10 or 20-day moving average (shorter time-frames and more volatile trends).

We are heading toward an interesting area to watch and finally trucking closer to breaking the 200-day moving average, a long-term trend. Most investors use the 200-day as a macro trend-line.

Below 200 SMA = bearish trend

Above 200 SMA = bullish trend

Of course, these can change just as fast, but we haven‚Äôt been above the 50-day since August and above the 200-day moving average since April, where we briefly pierced it, and then quickly continued back down. Technical indicators are usually viewed as zones of support and resistance where the 200-SMA is the last stand in either direction.

But something else changed on Thursday/Friday as well. Net options sentiment in single names skyrocketed to the upside (and with good reason). Let's take a look, data/screenshots from [Prospero.AI](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Finding that a lot of names saw an uptick in net options sentiment, which moved higher from the open on Thursday, in parallel to the market activity, and then followed through with similar action on Friday. The thing about market ""bottoms"" on the short or mid-range time-frame is that eventually shorts get exhausted and become buyers of the stock (covering). This could be the case of what we are seeing along with some option buying to the upside (buyer is aggressor in the trade).

A continue of the bullish trend combined with the Gamma squeeze of net option buying may add fuel to the fire to any year-end rally. Most names are still trading down 50-60% from the YTD highs, so rallies to the upside still have the chance to be very aggressive.  This would usually include a combination of short-covering, funds deploying capital and adding back to positions, and gamma squeeze, signaling we may be at the end of the bear market.

If options continue on the bullish side I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to finish the year with a small rally in the indices with more aggressive rally in singular names. More likely than not it will be the growth names that have been battered, but are still looking good on fundamentals.",11-13-2022
"Is it possible to bet on a ratio of specific stock pair? For example TSLA/RIVNHi, I'm new to stocks and options, sorry if the question is basic. I'd like to bet on a specific pair of stocks with no connection on their real value. How can I do that?  
For example right now market cap of Rivian is 29B, Tesla 673B. Ratio Tesla/Rivian 23X, my guess in a couple of month it should be a around 15-17. How can I bet on this ratio?",11-02-2022

"Expected Moves, Tesla, Netflix, Snap, Goldman and more.## Market View

**Last Week ‚Äì**¬†SPY was lower by about 1.5% last week. That was inside the 2.9% move options were pricing. Similar to the 1.5% move higher 2 weeks ago, markets were much more volatile intra-week than the final result would indicate. Thursday saw a big rally that broke a 6 day losing streak, but those gains were short-lived as stocks were once again steeply lower on Friday. Treasury yields and the dollar continue to be the main drivers of the day-to-day swings. Earnings season picks up in intensity the next few weeks and that may begin to move the broader markets as well.

Implied volatility remained near the highs of the year with the VIX once again closing the week near 32.

## Bullish by Not Being Bearish

The past few weeks we‚Äôve detailed a few strategies for a high-vol environment, including selling high IV (and wide expected moves) via Iron Condors as well using credit put spreads in potentially oversold stocks while not needing a rally to hold (just the stock to stop going lower). We‚Äôll check in first with the credit put spread examples from Oct 2nd‚Äôs post that expire this week.

The first was the GOOGL -96/+91 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), which could be sold at around 1.90 at the time, with the stock trading 95.80 It could be bought to close for about 1.40 at Friday‚Äôs close. The second was the GOOGL -91/+90 credit put spread (expiring Oct 21st), also with the stock trading 95.80. At the time it could be sold at roughly 0.26, it could be bought to close this past Friday for about 0.12.

GOOGL stock is only higher by about a dollar since then and hasn‚Äôt been much lower than where the stock was when those trade examples were detailed. The key point here is that buying calls or even call spreads in a high implied vol environment is difficult because rallies in the stock have not been sustainable. Buying premium needs a large sustained move to be right when vol is this high. But selling premium in high vol allows for some wiggle room, and can be best described in this case as being bullish, by not being bearish.

Continuing on that theme, here‚Äôs a comparison of an at-the-money call, and an at-the-money credit put spread in QQQ, expiring Nov 21st:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/01mt1qpks8u91.png?width=546&format=png&auto=webp&s=9169ab50abd8a953cd1a8a32d4a38ed390cbe2a0

As you can see, the two trades risk about the same amount. However, buying the call needs QQQ above $273.25, while the credit put spread needs QQQ to not be below $254.45. Obviously, the credit put spread can only make $657, while the potential gains on the call are unlimited. But‚Ä¶ The call needs QQQ to be nearly $19 higher from its current level before it would make the same.

Again, this is just an example. QQQ will see some of its biggest names report earnings over the next few weeks and that credit put spread could easily be underwater. But the risk is defined, and the chances of it being a complete loss are much lower than buying calls, especially with implied vol so high.

## In the News

Last we checked in on Tesla (TSLA) in this space was with the stock heading into its 3-for-1 stock split. At the time the stock was about $295 split-adjusted and options were pricing an expected move was about 11% for the next month and a year-end expected move of about 25%. The stock did indeed move lower by about 11% but has now rallied right back, essentially now unchanged since its split and near $300.

As we‚Äôve mentioned numerous times, TSLA stock has tended to make quick moves that far outpace option pricing, both higher and lower in the stock, over the past year. But splits can sometimes affect a stock‚Äôs volatility. Since the split, TSLA stock moves have been fairly muted, albeit with a very small sample set. Here‚Äôs the pricing going forward, with the options market pricing about a 10% move for the next month, and about a 20% move into year-end:

Over the weekend Tesla (TSLA) announced a 25% increase to the price of their ‚Äúfull self-driving‚Äù software. Tesla shares are up 40% from recent lows and off about 5% from recent highs. Over the past year Tesla stock has seen multiple 20%+ rallies that take place over 3-4 week spans. The most recent rally from July 15th to August 15th was the largest of those moves percentage-wise. Since the all time high in Nov of ‚Äô21 the stock has put in two lower highs at the apex of these sharp rallies, first in January, then in April. The last large move lower in the stock that happened from early April to mid May saw the stock down more than 50%.

As stated before, Tesla stock has seen moves way beyond option pricing on a consistent basis for the past year, both higher and lower. Here‚Äôs a look at the past year‚Äôs moves as compared to the current expected move in the options market. Options are pricing about an 11% move over the next month, and only about a 25% move out to January, much less than the types of moves the stock has seen over the past year:

"Upcoming Tesla SplitHi all, just want to confirm what I understand about playing options with an upcoming split.

Basically, with a split of 1:3, whatever options I sold will basically reduce their strike and premiums by 1/3, while my number of contracts increase by 3? I.e. if the price stays roughly the same after a split, nothing will change from my perspective. Thinking to sell some options but since this is my first time, I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing here. Thanks for your input.",08-19-2022
"Generating 20% profit exploiting Tesla Volatility to create iron condorsSo Tesla stock and options are scary. The options can move either way fairly fast. Worst of all, you can get screwed with IV if you hold too long. But what I‚Äôve been doing is using spy as a barometer. When spy looks like it‚Äôs bouncing, I try to time it with Tesla‚Äôs stock dip and potential option dip to get in (usually call first) and then immediately send out a working order to sell a call against it hoping someone quickly buys it when the stock bounces up $0.50 to $0.80. I then buy a put spread with the same strike to lock in the profit. The trick is to be in and out in a minute or two. So far I get out within 10-30 seconds. There are numerous opportunities throughout the day to pile in. 

Today for example, my cost basis

Aug 26 exp

Long 865c $40.40

Short 867.5c $39.70

Long 867.5p $42.06

Short 865p $40.78

The condor basically guarantees me a profit. Or I can sell these off at different times of the day or even break them apart. I‚Äôm usually averaging $50-60 profit out of $250 or $500 per spread (so about 10 to 20% profit). Again, the profits are slim, this is all about volume. If you can do this 50 times in a day, it‚Äôll add up. 

If you get caught and prices start dropping hard, cover your long immediately and take the loss. You might be able to recover another time but don‚Äôt play around with Tesla when the market moves against you.

### In the News

In early July when Tesla (TSLA) stock was trading around $680, we looked at how options were pricing the upcoming month that included an earnings event. Tesla is a stock that has tended to move alot more than options are pricing when it gets moving (both higher and lower) over the past year.

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

That 15% move by end of July was pricing a bullish consensus of about $780 in the stock. With this move higher Tesla actually ended July at $890, +$110 above what options were pricing at the time.

After the move higher Tesla options are pricing about 10% for August, which would put the stock near $800 or $1000:

"Cheaper Tesla Options?So I'm not the smartest guy in the world. Maybe you saw yesterday but I didn't understand the risks of options and made a post asking where 100 people commented about how stupid I am. Fair enough, I now learned a lot more and I'm learning from youtube videos a robinhood worker gave me (i called robinhood at like 1am to ask a lot of questions, guy was also really cool). But anyways I posted this on WSB a few days ago and I think it is genius and I am now up far more than when it was posted and it has a long way to climb up in my opinion. Curious to see your guys thought because a lot of you know a lot more about options then I do apparently. Just note it's a risk I was dumb when I bought it and I am still dumb. However I do genuinely believe I am right and this is a great idea. 

Also if u want a video form of me saying this it is here 
https://youtu.be/fBF5KF-bKGc . The text below is probably better to read but if u don't want to feel free to watch.

So basically you probably knew this but the SEC allowed single stock ETFs like a week ago. TSLQ is one that's shorts Tesla and the one I am mostly interested in. I think that people drastically underrated how much this changes things. Literally everything will be different in my opinion. People were saying this is just options with extra steps and let me explain why I think its not. First of all you can buy options on these for a massive discount. Let me explain
Tesla options are very very expensive 
If we look at a date like 8/19 (the first available options for TSLQ) we can see that the calls and puts are over 50.00 dollars so over 5k to buy them. And some are even more pricey and the further out you go (date wise) the higher cost overall.
TSLQ as you would guess are way cheaper. A lot of contracts still have yet to be filled (in my experience the lowest i was able to get was 2.00 for a contrcat that plummeted already) and 2.75 for one of the 0s. 
To me this will drastically change and will climb closer to the Tesla prices because these are again just a way to buy discounted Tesla options. For example TSLQ shorts Tesla therefore I have purchased puts (my positions at bottom) so really I basically bought calls on Tesla. 
The issue is that the trading volume is low which is because it's new in my opinion. Once people start realizing that you can do this and it is accessible in Robinhood I think the will go up to easily a 1:5 TSLQ to Tesla ratio. 
That's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not alot to a lot of you). 

TLDR:
So basically going back to my play I am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these insanely undervalue things. 

My positions 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Fi7Vkn3Uh7P37Ljdfqkx0pu_QrL4BcP/view?usp=drivesdk 

Wish I had more money I can take this risk with but I hope you all could capitalize on it. (Which also makes me money, obviously)
And again I am confident and am fine with taking L if I'm wrong but on the one that I'm down like -190 or whatever that is like 95% of what I put it. Not worried though 

Examples of TSLQ options

TLDR (but at bottom):

"Expected moves this week. Tesla, Twitter, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and more.### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** After a down move to start the week the SPY was higher by about 2% last week, in line with the 2.1% move options were pricing. That‚Äôs 2 straight weeks of moves in line with option pricing following 3-4 weeks of moves that far outpaced option pricing.

### In the News

After the close Friday news broke that Elon Musk is trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR). This was not a huge surprise to the markets as TWTR was already trading -35%+ to its announced deal price. The stock was down an additional 5% after hours Friday. Tesla (TSLA) stock was higher last week, and was up after hours Friday on the news. The stock had not performed well since Musk‚Äôs TWTR takeover was announced and investors in TSLA seem happier without the distraction. Tesla stock was near $770 after hours on Friday, up from $680 the week before. From last week:

>TSLA stock is trading near the same price of a year ago and is down about 45% from its all time highs above $1200. Options, which have underpriced moves in the stock (higher and lower) during its large swings of the past year are now pricing about a 15% move for the rest of July and about a 35% move by year end.

TSLA already made the move options were pricing for all of July before the calendar hit the 9th of July. It‚Äôs now pricing about an 11% move for the rest of the month.

The Musk / Twitter news may have been portrayed as a surprise over the weekend in the media, but clearly markets weren‚Äôt pricing a big chance of it happening. TWTR options were pricing a bullish consensus of about $46 in the stock out to December, well below the announced takeover price. The bearish consensus in December is about $25:

"Theoretically, could Elon Musk set-up a Collar on his Tesla stock if he wanted to or would such a large trade be impossible?If someone with a large amount of shares in a company wanted to set up a collar to hedge from losses, what would the process be?

"Late to the game? Using Spy Puts to salvage portfolio?I've learned a lot from reading on this sub, but I still feel like a total newbie compared to many here.  I only dabble in options, mostly as a gambling past time. 

However, given the market downturn, which we've been speaking about for a while, I feel obligated to do something.....finally. Feels like a slow mo crash, you know it's happening, but you just let it...

I've researched the question, but really more questions come up. 

I have a high 6 figure portfolio, mostly vstax, qqq, with 10 or so blue chips (Tesla/amd/aaple/etc).  

I've lost about 20+% off the top 

What I ask is simply: Downside to doing a 100k spy otm put 6 months out.  If It goes down as expected, hey it'll hedge.  If it just plateaus, well I lose 100k. Sucks, but not the end of the world.

"Synthetic shorting or using options to hedge my positionI have a couple of shares in Tesla and VOO. But they aren‚Äôt near 100 shares so I can‚Äôt sell covered calls on them. 

I have a bearish view on the market in the mid to long term(6-9 months) and was wondering what my options(outcomes not contracts) are. 

I‚Äôm looking to do a bear call spread with a net delta to represent my number of shares. 
ie. I have 22 shares of Tesla. 
If I do a bear call spread of 750/850, if 750 has a delta of .35 and 850 has a delta of.13
The bear call spread has a net delta of .22(.35-.13)
Am I actually delta neutral?

Would it be better to do a bear call spread and buy puts to achieve a delta neutral position?

The idea is to hedge my position without selling my shares. 
Appreciate any insights as to what I should do or why I shouldn‚Äôt do what I‚Äôm thinking. 

Many thanks in advance!",06-14-2022
"I have 700k to Sell long OTM Tesla covered CallsI really have 350k but with Robinhood margin it‚Äôs 700k. I can buy about 900 shares of Tesla with this, allowing me to sell 9 calls. 

I‚Äôm interested in selling nine March 17th 2023 $880 calls= value 96k

Worse comes to worse, it hits my strike and I  make over 100k when the calls write. 

I guess if Tesla tanks hard enough the whole strategy is fucked. The premiums on calls are so high it‚Äôs so tempting. What do you guys think?

Is there a better stock to do this will to lock in guaranteed gains?",06-06-2022
"Tesla optionsSo I purchased a June 2022 $680 call on Tesla 

Purchase price $5500
Current value $9715
Total profit of $4,215 so far

I was contemplating either:
1. Waiting for TSLA to plateau and sell the option and lock-in in a return
2. write a covered call at say a 10-15% premium for 1 month to expire in 06/22

If ultimately I exercise the option at maturity I would mostly use my margin.  Based on review of option chains it appears that a 800 June/2022 covered call would net ~$2400.  This is also not my only holding.  I‚Äôm mostly an income investor and receive around $1600/m in dividends through my stock portfolio.  So I have an ability to absorb losses if Tesla starts to tank. My thought is that I‚Äôd likely write a covered call each month except the month of their earnings report. I realize the risk in this, but a risk I‚Äôm willing to take.. 

Anyone have thoughts on strategy 1 or 2? I realize Tesla is volatile right now.. but that just feeds into the premiums that I would be receiving.",05-28-2022
"Options strategies to protect against a margin call within a timeframe? (something like protective puts, maybe a bit more sophisticated?)Here's what I'm looking for...

I have a large concentrated TSLA position, sitting at about 50% equity currently. My margin call price should be around $560. I also have strong conviction that Tesla will perform extremely well in Q3, but I have little conviction that it won't get crushed at some point between now and Q3 results.

So, while we're having this rally, I'd like to open some protective options that will save me from that potential margin call.

So I'd think the optimization here is for price per delta at $560, basically, and I'd like it to be really flat across now to Q3. Is there some software I can use to do this optimization? I've been poking around at optionsprofitcalculator but it is difficult to build an optimal strategy. Is there maybe a python version of that that I can build an optimizer around?",05-26-2022
"Sell Tesla $1000 Puts 2024 JanHi there, 

Thinking of selling margin secured Tesla $1000 puts that expires in Jan 2024 when Tesla hits ~$550 or the next major sell off. 

In this because I think there will be a price rebound and hoping to close this when there is a huge price delta change. Don‚Äôt mind the opportunity cost just want a lower the risk. 

Question
- What are the chances of being assigned? The extrinsic value is quite large although it‚Äôs ITM and the put expiry is still so long from now 
- What‚Äôs a good hedging move to take if Tesla price falls below $500? 


Thanks!",05-24-2022

"TSLA $955 Call 06/24I haven't really done any option trades before and I was wondering if Tesla is a good underlying to do simple option trades on. 

Do you guys think this Call would be in profit by the expiration date? 

I feel like it would be able to because Tesla is volatile but at the same time it wouldn't be too much of a risk if I were to buy only 1 contract. With Twitter and all I feel that Tesla is affected. I have mixed feelings. 

What do you guys think about this call? If I were to do this call, do you think I should sell the call before expiration?

"Covered call TESLAHave 100 shares of tesla and considering selling a covered call. Never done this before

Thinking of selling a CC for next Friday at $900.

Current stock price $795

The  only downside I see is if the stock rallies beyond 900 then I miss   potential profit but I still made the premium from selling the call and I   paid on average $800 per tesla share so will make $10k for the option   being exercised (80,000 spent on shares, sold for 90,000)

what other downsides are there?",05-11-2022
"Bear SPY strategy with high IVRelative beginner here, asking half out of academic interest and half to maybe make some small plays (already got lucky with Tesla puts so happy to sit on cash until VIX is back below ~23).

If I were of the opinion that SPY was going to 300-250 by the end of the year, maybe earlier, what would be an option strategy to play this? I've mostly done simple long options before, but I don't think buying ATM or slightly OTM long SPY puts would work that well because IV is so high that any fall in volatility or inevitable green day would cost too much, even if I was right about the general direction of SPY. 

What do you think of shorting SPY and hedging with a long OTM call? Or selling ATM SPY calls and hedging with a (far) OTM call? 

(Also I can't really do vertical spreads well because of stupid German tax rules but this can be disregarded)",05-10-2022
"TSLA putsHi,

I'm still learning on how to use options..

Since I think tesla is way overpriced for this market, I'd like to know what's the general opinion on buying TSLA puts to try to make some money in this downtrend.

It had liquidated a lot of my holdings plus some of the ‚Äúlong positions‚Äù within a bear call spread which increased my margin requirements!

But ultimately also liquidated tesla spread but now I still have 0 bp

# Terminology

***Average***: For a set of values, this is the mean value calculated by summing all values and dividing by their number.

***Standard deviation***\*\*:\*\* Measure of the dispersion of a set of values. A quick approximation is that most values are as low as average minus this, and as high as average plus this.

=> Example: XYZ stock moved 5% average on past releases with 2% std => *most past moves are between 3% and 7%*

***Straddle***\*\*:\*\* ITM call and put, close to delta neutral, meaning not sensitive to a specific direction of the stock price, but needs an implied absolute move.

***Strangle:*** Riskier version of the straddle with OTM call and put. Usually comes with a higher break even and higher max loss / profits.

***Implied / expected move:*** When buying a call, you need the stock price to move up a certain amount to break-even and profit, that is the implied move of the position. Here we are interested in non-directional trades, it refers to the minimum absolute stock move needed for a trade to turn profit for a straddle position, explained below.

For each stock, an expected movement around earnings is priced-in: this means that a movement play (classically a straddle) would need a certain percentage move in the stock price to be profitable. That percentage is usually close to the average move during past earnings of the stock.

We show below key numbers of past moves and straddles / strangles.

"Expected moves this week. Twitter, Tesla, Netflix, Snap and more.### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** SPY was lower by about 2.3% last week, a larger move than the 1.4% options were pricing. Implied volatility was slightly higher on the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 1.4% move this week (about $6 in either direction) into Thursday‚Äôs close. Markets are closed on Friday.

**Implied Volatility / VIX ‚Äì** The VIX once again crept higher, moving from 21 the prior week to just under 23 to end last week. It remains higher than historical averages.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **1.8%** (about $8)
* QQQ **2.6%** (about $9)
* IWM **2.5%** (about $5)
* DIA **1.5%** (about $5)

### In the News

Twitter (TWTR) saw more headlines last week, many of them breaking on the platform, and Elon Musk‚Äôs account. Following a week where the stock was 18% higher, the stock was basically unchanged last week, Options were pricing about a 5.5% move last week and about 13% for the rest of April. Options are pricing a roughly 9% move this week, and despite a week passing, 13% to the end of April. The company is due to report earnings April 28th.

The stock is now near the midpoint of where it was just before the original Musk news (just below $40) and the highs it reached after (near $53). The 13% expected move for the end of April (that includes earnings) puts a bullish and bearish options consensus roughly inline with those two levels. Musk proposed a bid to take the company private at $54.20 a share but the Twitter board enacted a poison pill strategy to prevent a takeover.

A dollar wide-winged Iron Condor expiring April 29th, with short strikes set at 41 and 53 is priced to risk roughly $55 to make up to $45 (using the mid). That range is in-line with the move options are pricing and the short strike on the upside is right near Musk‚Äôs stated price. Options have a tendency to price the obvious at times and in this case those are the levels everyone is focused on. You can see that range and the risk/reward on the chart below:

"American Airlines Covered Call (Update)So a few months ago I posted on this sub asking if covered calls were the fastest way to gain wealth, particularly with American Airlines (Aal) if you had conviction. 

[Link to post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qtoru1/are_covered_calls_really_the_fastest_and_safest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Well here‚Äôs an update. Everything was going great, at one point my cost basis was down to $15.50 and I was up like 40%. And then the Russian bs happened. I have no idea why I didn‚Äôt sell other than outright greed. The week before I had finished doing the math and calculated that with about 50 trades, maxing out margin, and earning about $0.30 per trade with Aal, I could more or less 4-5x my money. Your can probably guess where this is heading. 

I sold everything and went all in on Aal at 16.13. I didn‚Äôt even max out my margin which pissed me off initially.. I started feeling uneasy about the trade almost immediately seeing as that Aal was struggling around 16.19. Debating whether to sell, I figured just sell the 16.50c exp in a day, surely Aal won‚Äôt drop below 16‚Ä¶.
20 minutes later Aal is down around 15.77. Suddenly I start remembering all the comments asking what I would do if Aal dropped a dollar or two. Well, I was prepared to hold for a $2-3 drop, but surely you have to be smoking to believe Aal would drop past $15. Even if it did I could breakeven after 3 weeks. Aal bounces back to 15.97, I‚Äôm feeling confident. I go about my day. Next day it opens at 15.10, bounces to 15.55 before dropping to 14.60. I‚Äôm underwater and stressed out. Monday rolls around and it drops as low as $12.46. Triggering a margin call. 

At this point all my money is tied up in Aal. I stopped working because well, this plan was going great and I was already window shopping for a house. Soooo there I was stuck. TD Ameritrade said they would give me a week. Midway through the week I ultimately sell at 13.60. And for the first time in awhile, fear sets in, I don‚Äôt buy call options despite me thinking the market is overreacting, mostly because I‚Äôm afraid of losing even more money. Only to watch it bounce back to $16.30 two days after TD would have forced me out. 

As of April 13, the stock is at $18 and I am having a hard time dealing with this. I was right about the price, I was right about the strategy but wrong on entry by maybe 30 minutes, two more days or extra cash would have made all the difference. Margin call would have been avoided if I bought one put on spy, Aal, or maybe a gush call or something to offset but after I got filled my buying power disappeared so I rolled the dice.


And you know how the story goes, I started over trading and ended up losing far more. Currently down 80%. Fucked up part was I bought Tesla 1105c last week @18.30 each and sold early only to watch it hit $48. Did the same for 1130p @20 only to watch it hit $100:/


Last Aal trade (around March 2ish)

Entry: $16.13 shares ($0.13 credit from 16.50c)

Planned exit: $16.30

Exit: $13.60


My advice to people: when you start mentally and physically customizing cars and houses in your mind, you should stop trading options for a week.

I am expecting one final large cash infusion (insurance and gov) in about 2 months and am currently looking to go all in on Uber ($31), Lyft ($32), We ($5), upst ($65), Pypl ($100), Amzn ($2700), aap ($150), BA ($160), Nvda ($200).",04-13-2022

Tesla (TSLA) stock is higher by about 40% in the past 3 weeks. As mentioned in these posts for some time, Tesla options have been consistently underpricing its large moves (both higher and lower) since its October ‚Äô21 breakout.

Over the weekend the company reported vehicle deliveries of 310k, slightly lower than analyst expectations. Options are pricing about a 6% move in TSLA this week and about 13% for the next month.

"Sell ATM puts and calls expiring on Dec 31 for tax purposes?Last year I inadvertently was ITM on a bunch of Tesla CCs at year end, then rolled them to the next week.  This resulted in 6 figure tax deduction, with the gains deferred until I got OTM a while later.

I'm contemplating selling ATM puts and calls right at the end of the year to take advantage of this.  If you win, take a nice gain.  If you lose, you roll and defer a bunch of taxes.  Assuming you do manage to get OTM, is there a caveat or downside here?  I believe you cannot sell an ITM call to exploit this, as there are some tax rules about that.",04-02-2022

I don't understand why my options are still so cheap because the price has constantly risen since I bought them. I won't make much profit at this point. I will probably make more profit by executing the option and buy the shares at 650 euros  and cashing in the difference since Tesla will be around 800-900 in June in my option.

In late February, with Tesla trading near $800 I highlighted how options had been underpricing the stock‚Äôs large swings since its parabolic breakout in Oct ‚Äô21:

>*Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently. Out of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls. Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock‚Äôs moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn‚Äôt always reflect realized volatility because market makers don‚Äôt want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops.*

In the past two weeks, TSLA made a low near $760 (a double bottom from late February) and rallied with the broader market last week to close above $900 on Friday. That move to the upside was about the move options were pricing for March (with a week remaining) and implied volatility was lower on the move higher. However, the entirety of its move from $760 to nearly $910 came in the span of just a few days.

IV is lower and the stock is not seeing the large upside skew to high vol out of the money calls than it did during its moves higher at the end of 2021. Options are pricing about a 5% move this week and about 11.5% out to April 22nd:

The premium I get is about 23.00 per share, so 2300 dollars total. If Tesla stays below 815, I just made 2300. If Tesla trades above 815, I sell my shares at 815 per share and make 500 from the shares and the premium of 2300, so a total of 2800 dollars.

After this, I repeat and buy the shares again at the current trading price, and then sell covered calls slightly above the trading price, so I receive a high premium. If I do this each week, could I be guaranteed a profit of 2300 each week?

Tesla (TSLA) stock‚Äôs breakout in the Fall of ‚Äô21 took it from under $800 to over $1200 in the span of a few weeks. After a late year pullback to under $900 it made another run to $1200 to start 2022. During the market lows of last week it traded as low as $700 before finishing the week back above $800. In other words, it‚Äôs been volatile. Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves.

"Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \[1\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \[2\]

While we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:

1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**
2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**
3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**

So it‚Äôs high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!

https://preview.redd.it/xethcdd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c64b3059d57df22d9468b0803fd781f12b5e18

**Analysis**

The data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \[3\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \[4\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.

Since Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \[5\].

a. One-day

b. One-Week

c. One-Month

Given that Mad Money (Cramer‚Äôs Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)

All the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.

https://preview.redd.it/0x2ikwd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2fb94ba1af493740362bb939e13743b8160237

**Results**

https://preview.redd.it/7mbvwrh4fv981.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4edaf25fc2287a0b5700540e989b8662b43bd1

1-day performance of Cramer‚Äôs recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.

Another interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer‚Äôs Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \[6\]!

His sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!

Given that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let‚Äôs calculate the accuracy of his calls.

Here I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \[7\].

While this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!

Finally, it‚Äôs time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?

https://preview.redd.it/4jy8xsb6fv981.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c73cc998f6e0a5d96e779f28f14a2936f66d273

Oh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer‚Äôs Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.

Before you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \[8\].

**Limitations of the analysis**

The analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.

1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.
2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven‚Äôt manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.

>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.

https://preview.redd.it/l5cfhxd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5669a311e8067cff01cd4ad304386f059914c610

**Conclusion**

No matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it‚Äôs due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it‚Äôs simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \[9\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.

I would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.

It only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!

**Footnotes and existing research**

**\[1\]** For those who don‚Äôt know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.

**\[2\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).

**\[3\]** It‚Äôs not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.

**\[4\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.

**\[5\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.

**\[6\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.

**\[7\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) ‚Üí My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!

**\[8\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. ‚Üí Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.

**\[9\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.

**\[10\]** Since it‚Äôs a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.",01-05-2022

# Nvidia Locks In $700M AI Play

Nvidia has closed its $700 million acquisition of Israeli AI startup Run:ai, a move designed to optimize AI infrastructure and extend its dominance in the booming artificial intelligence sector. Regulatory hurdles? Cleared for takeoff‚Äîat least in Europe.

**Opening the Playbook**

Run:ai‚Äôs software, which helps maximize the efficiency of Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, will now be open-sourced. Translation: competitors like AMD and Intel can use the software too. Why share the crown jewels? Nvidia‚Äôs move could be a play to quiet antitrust critics while expanding its influence across the broader AI ecosystem.

The startup, which Nvidia has worked with since 2020, adds a critical layer to Nvidia‚Äôs growing empire‚Äîhelping power everything from data centers to cutting-edge AI systems.

**Antitrust Drama**

The deal wasn‚Äôt a breeze. Regulators in the EU gave the green light after a deep dive but didn‚Äôt miss the fact that Nvidia already controls about 80% of the GPU market. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice continues to take a closer look, adding a hint of uncertainty to Nvidia‚Äôs unchecked expansion.

For Nvidia, the stakes are high. As AI reshapes industries, its latest acquisition shows it‚Äôs not just chasing innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs determined to own the infrastructure behind it.

# Jeju Air Tragedy Sends Shockwaves Through Aviation

Boeing shares dropped 2% Monday after a tragic Jeju Air crash in South Korea killed 179 people, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in the nation‚Äôs history. Investigators are now looking into potential causes, including a bird strike and landing gear failure, as South Korea orders emergency inspections of all 737-800 planes in the country.

**The Timeline**

Here‚Äôs how the tragic event unfolded: Flight 2216, carrying 181 passengers and crew from Bangkok to Muan International Airport, declared a mayday after receiving a bird strike warning. The pilot aborted the first landing attempt, but during the second attempt, the landing gear failed to deploy. The jet skidded off the runway, struck a wall, and exploded into flames. Only two crew members survived.

Officials retrieved black boxes for analysis, while the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing are lending support to the investigation. The 737-800 has been a reliable aviation staple, but this incident has raised serious questions.

**Why It Matters**

This isn‚Äôt just an isolated event‚Äîit‚Äôs a major moment for Boeing, which is still reeling from past controversies surrounding its 737 Max series. South Korea has 101 active 737-800s across carriers like Jeju Air, Korean Air, and T‚Äôway Air, and the crash has spurred a nationwide inspection to ensure compliance with safety protocols.

Adding to the scrutiny: Jeju Air‚Äôs stock hit an all-time low following the crash, and Boeing is under pressure to uphold the reputation of its long-standing workhorse model. Aviation analysts believe investigators will closely examine bird strike standards, emergency response protocols, and why the landing gear wasn‚Äôt deployed.

**Bigger Picture:**¬†The tragedy also lands during political upheaval in South Korea, where Acting President Choi Sang-mok has declared a week of mourning. For Boeing and South Korean aviation, this is more than a PR crisis‚Äîit‚Äôs a test of safety practices in one of the industry‚Äôs most trusted aircraft models.",12-30-2024

# Nordstrom Checks Out of Wall Street

Nordstrom is saying goodbye to public markets. The founding family, with a little help from Mexican retailer El Puerto de Liverpool, has agreed to take the department store private in a $6.25 billion deal.

**Back to Basics**

The Nordstrom family isn‚Äôt new to this game. Their first attempt to take the company private in 2018 flopped, but this time, they‚Äôve got backup. Liverpool will grab a 49.9% stake, while the family holds the majority. Shareholders will get $24.25 per share in cash‚Äîa nice premium for a stock that‚Äôs struggled to keep up with the times.

Why now? The public markets haven‚Äôt been kind. Nordstrom‚Äôs revenue never fully recovered after the pandemic, and the company has faced increasing competition from online players and discount chains.

**Private Mode: Engaged**

Taking Nordstrom private could give the company the room it needs to make changes without shareholders breathing down its neck. Department stores are no stranger to activist investors pushing for cuts, closures, and spin-offs‚Äîan escape from that pressure might be just what Nordstrom needs.

Nordstrom Rack, its off-price chain, has been one bright spot lately, recovering from past missteps. But with department stores overall in decline, even Rack‚Äôs resurgence isn‚Äôt enough to make public investors swoon.

**New Partnership, New Hope**

Liverpool, a retail heavyweight in Mexico, sees the deal as an opportunity to expand its footprint beyond Latin America. Known for running some of Mexico‚Äôs biggest department stores and franchises like Pottery Barn, Liverpool could bring a fresh perspective to Nordstrom‚Äôs playbook.

For now, the Nordstrom family is betting big on their legacy‚Äîand hoping private life gives the chain a much-needed second wind. Whether they‚Äôll thrive or just escape the spotlight remains to be seen.

# New Year, New Fed Votes

The Federal Reserve is shaking things up in 2025, with fresh faces joining the committee that sets the country‚Äôs interest rates. And with inflation still sticking around like an unwelcome party guest, their decisions are bound to get tricky.

**Who‚Äôs In?**

This year‚Äôs rotation brings four new voters onto the Fed‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC): Boston‚Äôs Susan Collins, St. Louis‚Äôs Alberto Musalem, Kansas City‚Äôs Jeff Schmid, and Chicago‚Äôs Austan Goolsbee. These officials will weigh in on how fast to lower rates‚Äîa hot topic as inflation remains above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.

Outgoing members like Cleveland‚Äôs Beth Hammack have made headlines for dissenting in recent months, highlighting growing divides within the Fed. Expect more disagreements next year as policymakers tackle thorny questions about the economy.

**Slow and Steady**

Incoming members seem inclined to pump the brakes on rapid rate cuts. Musalem has already flagged concerns that inflation progress could stall, while Schmid has emphasized the need for cautious moves to avoid financial market chaos.

Collins and Goolsbee, meanwhile, lean toward gradual easing but stress that the final destination for rates remains uncertain. Goolsbee summed it up: ‚ÄúInflation is way down, but rates still have a fair amount to drop over the next 12-18 months.‚Äù

**A Wild Card Year**

The backdrop for these decisions? Potentially inflation-boosting policies from the incoming Trump administration, including higher tariffs and tax cuts. Add in a labor market under pressure, and 2025 could be the Fed‚Äôs most challenging year yet.

Chair Jerome Powell, fresh off a quarter-point rate cut in December, has signaled that future moves will depend entirely on the data. Translation: Don‚Äôt expect much action at the January meeting, but buckle up for a year of debates, dissents, and careful recalibration.¬†",12-24-2024
"Finally quitting day trading I thought the next time I would post would be to show everyone I finally broke even and made my money back. This is not the first time I quit, I quit several times through the journey but always came back. I stopped when I hit my max loss of 15k, came back after that, new max loss of 25k, still came back after that. Now I just hit 35k total loss and I‚Äôm done for good. I can‚Äôt come back now and will never since I just withdrew the remaining funds and am laying back towards the debts I owe. 
I wanted to prove all the Wendy‚Äôs employees wrong. My entire journey was only based on making back my losses and getting out at breakeven.  Starting off down a couple grand months ago it‚Äôs all been downhill. I made some big daily gains but always followed it up with much bigger losses. There are so many lessons I learned throughout my time trading and I actually thought I got the hang of it at times and could consistently make money. However, I‚Äôve realized trading is a scam and the stock market is all BS manipulated by algorithms. 

My parents were generous enough to give me a loan to trade and I blew their money. Day trading consumed me like a gambling addict and I couldn‚Äôt eat, sleep, be happy with my wife until I made my money back.  I remember going under 25k and having PDT violations. I called up my mom again begging for money, she sent me more and I topped off my account. Week after that I went under again and now I‚Äôm asking my wife for funds she gives it to me.  I‚Äôm feeling like a drug addict at this point. Every few days I‚Äôm withdrawing money from my bank account and sending into Webull to fuel this mess. As soon as pay day arrived from work I would immediately transfer the money into my brokerage account. I know I will piss a lot of people off but I knew there was a major problem when I took out a large 401k loan against my retirement account.  I couldn‚Äôt believe it but I lost that money too in just a few weeks.  I wish I never started trading.  I loved being a day trader since it gave me dreams. It gave me the hope and chance to maybe have freedom someday and not have to work a 9-5. Or that I could make huge money and buy my family a house or gifts for my wife.  My wife doesn‚Äôt even know the extent of my losses yet.  She‚Äôs just been supportive and trusts me to do the right thing. 
I‚Äôm quitting everything now since I actually stopped day trading and tried out buying and holding stocks.  I bought AMD on a dip and if you can see how much I‚Äôve lost on that.  It just keeps dropping and dropping and I‚Äôve given up on that too.  
I don‚Äôt recommend anyone day trade. I wish I never learned about this I would have no debts and be such a happier person.  The reason is because most of the gains that happen on stocks are all over night.  Throughout the day the stocks would sell off and overnight jump up.  I was literally fighting to make such small dollar amounts on trades when overnight jumps were huge. If you look it up you can see that most gains happen overnight and buying throughout the day and closing before the end is just not a smart idea. 
All of you say that it‚Äôs not gambling if you have an edge.  Well screw that, if you have an edge at black jack or can count cards at poker you‚Äôre still gambling. An edge in trading realistically only game me a 50% win rate.  After considering spread between bid and ask I always end up net negative.  Furthermore level 2 data is all manipulation and bs.  So many times I saw a huge buyer at a support level and would buy right above them.  As soon as I get in the price immediately drops through that level and nothing shows on the time and sales about that buyer. Clearly they are pulling their orders.  
Sorry for going on so long but overall this game is all crap.  It‚Äôs a losing battle and I don‚Äôt recommend anyone do it.  I‚Äôve failed my family, failed my wife, and mostly myself. It‚Äôs taken me a lot of courage to pull the plug for good.  Worst part is. If I just bought and held NVDA when I started trading 8 months ago I would have been up nearly double my account.  That sucks man. ",12-19-2024

# Honda and Nissan Might Merge to Take on the Big Dogs

Honda and Nissan‚Äîtwo of Japan‚Äôs auto heavyweights‚Äîare reportedly kicking the tires on a potential merger that could reshape the global car game. The alliance would create a combined force capable of challenging Toyota at home and Tesla, plus those nimble Chinese EV makers abroad.

**From Rivals to Ride-Sharers**

Talks are still in the ‚Äúwhat if we‚Ä¶‚Äù phase, but reports suggest the companies could form a shared holding company. Nissan‚Äôs 24% stake in Mitsubishi means the smaller automaker might join the party too, turning this into Japan‚Äôs most significant automotive shakeup since your dad gave up his stick shift. Together, the trio could clock 8 million vehicles a year, still a few laps behind Toyota‚Äôs 11 million, but enough to put some pressure on the global leaders.

For Nissan, it‚Äôs a much-needed tow. The automaker‚Äôs operating income nosedived 90% this year amid struggles in the U.S. and China. Honda, meanwhile, has been hustling to keep its EV ambitions alive while wrestling with rising development costs. A merger could streamline production and tech investment‚Äîtwo essentials for staying relevant in the EV race.

**The Toyota Problem**

Toyota has been eating everyone‚Äôs lunch, pulling smaller players like Subaru, Suzuki, and Mazda under its wing to dominate the EV-hybrid market. A Honda-Nissan team-up could help level the playing field. Think shared EV batteries, consolidated R&D, and enough scale to punch back against Tesla and China‚Äôs BYD, which are sprinting ahead in electric cars.

Still, merging two fierce rivals is easier said than done. There‚Äôs overlap in their lineups, deep cultural differences, and, you know, decades of competition. As one analyst quipped, ‚ÄúThey might share the road, but they‚Äôre not always driving in the same direction.‚Äù

**Markets Hit the Gas**

Investors love a comeback story, and Nissan‚Äôs stock surged 22% on the news, while Honda‚Äôs dipped 1.2%, as traders weighed the risk of pairing two struggling players.

If this sounds like d√©j√† vu, that‚Äôs because Nissan‚Äôs been here before. Its long and messy relationship with France‚Äôs Renault ended in a complicated corporate divorce. Now, Nissan‚Äôs searching for a new partner to help it avoid stalling out.

**The Big Picture:**¬†In an EV era where bigger equals better, this potential merger underscores a simple truth: carmakers need scale to survive. If Honda and Nissan can pull this off, they‚Äôd become the David to Toyota‚Äôs Goliath‚Äîa true heavyweight challenger in a market where the only real sin is being too small to matter.

# Dow‚Äôs Nine-Day Slide ‚Äî Is It Really That Bad?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average just wrapped up its ninth straight losing day, marking its longest skid since 1978. While headlines scream ‚Äúhistoric slump,‚Äù the story under the hood isn‚Äôt quite as dire‚Äîthough it might feel like a blast from the Carter administration.

**What‚Äôs Dragging the Dow Down?**

Let‚Äôs talk about the index‚Äôs biggest weight: UnitedHealth Group. Shares of the healthcare giant have tumbled 21% since December 4th, when tragedy struck with the fatal shooting of its insurance CEO, Brian Thompson. Combine that with President-elect Trump‚Äôs recent vow to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù healthcare middlemen like UnitedHealth, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for investor panic.

But UnitedHealth isn‚Äôt alone. Cyclical stocks like Sherwin-Williams and Caterpillar‚Äîwhich surged post-election on hopes for deregulation and infrastructure spending‚Äîhave since lost steam. Even Nvidia, a star player in 2024, is down 10% during the slump.

**Not All Markets Are Moping**

Here‚Äôs the kicker: the Dow‚Äôs funk isn‚Äôt dragging everyone down. The S&P 500 is holding strong near record highs, and the Nasdaq Composite hit an all-time high just yesterday, thanks to megacap tech‚Äôs ongoing dominance. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple are all thriving, but their wins barely register in the Dow‚Äôs quirky price-weighted formula, where share price matters more than market value.

In other words, the Dow‚Äôs losses aren‚Äôt a reflection of the broader market‚Äîit‚Äôs more of an index anomaly.

**So, Should You Worry?**

Here‚Äôs a little perspective: the Dow is only down 3.5% from its December 4th highs. That‚Äôs not even close to a correction, which kicks in at a 10% drop. More importantly, history is on investors‚Äô side. December‚Äôs second half typically sees markets recover as traders ride seasonal trends into the new year.

Plus, Wall Street pros remain optimistic about 2025. If anything, this dip could be a ‚Äúpause that refreshes,‚Äù as some strategists like to say‚Äîespecially with the Federal Reserve decision on deck this week.

**The Takeaway:**The Dow‚Äôs nine-day losing streak may look grim, but let‚Äôs not confuse noise with signals. Tech stocks are booming, the broader market is in good shape, and this pullback might just be a breather before the bulls take over to close out 2024.

So breathe easy, Dow-watchers.

But here's the kicker: this might be the final slice for a while, especially with 2025's uncertainties casting a shadow. Jerome Powell's words have been market movers all year, so tomorrow's decision feels like the grand finale in this monetary saga.

# Drones Are Soaring on Wall Street

Move over crypto and EVs, drones are the new darlings of both Wall Street and Reddit‚Äôs r/WallStreetBets. Shares of Red Cat Holdings (RCAT) skyrocketed 27% Monday after announcing a partnership with Palantir Technologies to integrate advanced visual navigation software into their drones.¬†

This AI-driven upgrade promises drones that don‚Äôt need GPS or radio control signals‚Äîa big win for military and government applications.

**Retail Traders Take Flight:**¬†Red Cat isn‚Äôt just a hit with investors; it‚Äôs dominating Reddit‚Äôs meme-stock hub. The stock surged to the sixth-most popular ticker on r/WallStreetBets, gaining over 1,625% in mentions over the past 24 hours, according to Quiver Quantitative. With retail traders piling in, Red Cat‚Äôs 2024 performance is up a jaw-dropping 1,129%.

Other drone stocks also caught some tailwinds:

* **Unusual Machines**¬†(+17.93%) got a lift from its Trump Jr. advisory board buzz. ($UMAC)
* **Kratos Defense and Security Solutions**¬†(+5.40%) and¬†**Aerovironment**¬†(+7.86%) joined the rally.

**Drones Are Having a Moment:**¬†It‚Äôs not just hype fueling the drone frenzy. Rising geopolitical tensions and an incoming Trump administration suggest increased spending on U.S.-made drones. Analysts are also bullish on federal and local governments ramping up counter-drone tech investments for public spaces like stadiums and airports.

Meanwhile, those mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey and across the Northeast have kept drones in the public eye‚Äîadding an element of intrigue (and meme potential).

**Reality Check:**¬†While Red Cat‚Äôs stock soared during the day, after-hours trading brought turbulence. The company reported a revenue drop from $3.9 million to $1.5 million in the second quarter and widened its losses to 18 cents per share. CEO Jeff Thompson said the company paused production of its Teal 2 drones to focus on its next-gen Black Widow, prioritizing long-term growth.

**The takeaway?**¬†Investors are betting big on drones, but as Red Cat‚Äôs mixed results show, not all growth stories take a straight path to the sky.

# Bitcoin Hits $107K: Bulls Keep the Party Going

First, investors are nearly certain the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this week (96% chance, according to CME‚Äôs FedWatch Tool), which is music to Bitcoin‚Äôs ears. Lower rates = weaker dollar = Bitcoin-friendly environment.

Second, the crypto crowd is buzzing after Donald Trump reiterated his plan to establish a national bitcoin strategic reserve in a CNBC interview. It‚Äôs a move that feels ripped from the playbook of oil reserves but could cement Bitcoin as part of the financial infrastructure. Trump summed it up with, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do something great with crypto.‚Äù

# BuzzFeed‚Äôs Hot Sale: ‚ÄúHot Ones‚Äù Gets a New Home

BuzzFeed just sold its crown jewel,¬†*First We Feast*‚Äîhome to the spicy celeb interview show¬†*Hot Ones*‚Äîfor $82.5 million. The buyer? A group led by Soros Fund Management, progressive media company Crooked Media, and YouTube duo Rhett and Link‚Äôs Mythical Entertainment. The deal marks a much-needed cash infusion for BuzzFeed as it battles mounting debt and declining valuation.

**Spicy Profits, Scorching Debt**  
  
While¬†*Hot Ones*¬†brings in about $30 million annually with its 14 million YouTube subscribers, BuzzFeed‚Äôs financial struggles have been anything but mild. Once valued at $1.5 billion, the media company is now worth around $150 million. This sale slashes BuzzFeed‚Äôs $120 million debt to $30 million, leaving it with more cash than liabilities‚Äîa small win in a tough media landscape.

Sean Evans, the host whose calm demeanor has guided celebs through fiery sauces, will stay on as Chief Creative Officer, while founder Chris Schonberger takes over as CEO. Both retain stakes in¬†*First We Feast*, signaling the brand‚Äôs continued independence.

**BuzzFeed‚Äôs Comeback Recipe: AI?**  
  
With its debt cooling off, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti is turning up the heat on an AI-driven future. Peretti plans to lean into ‚Äútech-enabled services‚Äù and AI-powered content to reinvigorate the brand. But details remain vague, and questions linger: Will AI listicles bring the same viral charm that made BuzzFeed famous?

**Media‚Äôs Chicken Wing Moment**  
BuzzFeed isn‚Äôt alone in downsizing to survive. Legacy media giants like Vice, Vox, and even Disney-backed brands have faced layoffs or filed for bankruptcy as digital advertising wanes. Meanwhile,¬†*Hot Ones*¬†and other next-gen content creators are proving that niche, viral-friendly media with strong branding can still sizzle.

**The takeaway?**¬†In a media world where old models are burning out, spicy creativity may be the secret sauce to staying relevant.

# YouTube TV Raises Prices Again

The streaming platform that once sold itself as a budget-friendly alternative to cable has inched closer to cable‚Äôs price tag. YouTube TV is hiking its monthly subscription to $83, effective January 13 for existing users, after already raising prices earlier this year.

**From Underdog to Overpriced?**  
  
Launched in 2017 at just $35 a month, YouTube TV entered the scene as a disruptor, offering live TV without the cable hassle. But over time, rising costs‚Äîmainly for live sports and programming‚Äîhave pushed the price higher: $40 in 2018, $65 in 2020, and now $83. While the platform still delivers over 100 channels and unlimited DVR storage, the price tag leaves cord-cutters wondering if the ‚Äúsavings‚Äù pitch holds up.

**The Big Picture**  
  
YouTube TV isn‚Äôt alone in raising prices. Hulu + Live TV charges the same $83, but bundles Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu content. Sling TV starts at $40 but requires add-ons to match YouTube TV‚Äôs channel lineup. Meanwhile, cable providers are quietly looking like a relative bargain for those who don‚Äôt mind the old-school setup.

**Streaming‚Äôs Identity Crisis**  
  
When streaming began, it promised two things: affordability and simplicity. With subscription fees rivaling traditional cable bills and add-on costs for premium features like 4K streaming, the industry is testing consumers‚Äô limits. For YouTube TV, the question becomes whether convenience‚Äîlike easy cancellation and no contracts‚Äîis enough to justify its growing costs.

**The takeaway?**¬†Cord-cutting isn‚Äôt dead, but it‚Äôs no longer the slam dunk it once was. Consumers now have to weigh whether the perks of streaming outweigh the price hikes‚Äîor if it‚Äôs time to reevaluate their subscription lineup.¬†",12-14-2024
"BTC Fees killing me,  should i do Stock trading?I love trading. Took me some years of failing but i startet beeing around 30 Percent Green every Month trading BTC USDC Spot leverage free while it had no fees. Literally fee free and no Spread too on Bybit and Binance. 
Was fun months. 
But now it has the same fees as the other pairs.
As you can see in my calculator the fees eat like 60 Percent of my Profits after the fee change. Making scalping BTC mathematicly almost impossible unless your winrate is insane high. Like unrealystic high. 

Since i live in Europe and we have little to none good Brokers available especially no Fee Free brokers
i maybe would use my Stock Degiro account, even though i hate everything about them. There is soooo high hiden fees for everything. The Euro to Dollar exchange rate is finacily Rape. Dont know how thats legal. 
Guess they can claim it stands somewhere written in Size 4-6. ^^

So who agrees scalping crypto is impossible and i should try scalping stocks after not doing it for a decade? 
Back in the days i was doing good trading one and the same stock every day. Maybe i pick one now too like Tesla stocks for example? 

whats the alternatives that i have? 
Was thinking of trading SP500 since i watch it everyday anyways but it looked like the fees are disturbing high too here. 
You guys are lucky trading in USA. 
In Europe the broker situation is insane horrible, basicly not existent almost imao. How do i trade gold? Or which other asset ist recommendable? 
Happy for any advice.

"Some questions from a new guyHello everyone,

I am quite new to day trading and have some questions, so I thought I would ask them here.

I am currently learning about day trading, I am reading some books on it (real books from real libraries) but of course reading about something and doing it are two very different things. I am also messing around with paper trading, I already have a broker and a platform I use. I am interested in stocks, mostly the more stable ones of the magnificent seven (so not Tesla lol) and the SNP500. I am familiar with the risk-reward of day trading and I am not one of those TikTok-motivated ones, I really want to do this. My questions are the following:

1. How long time frames do you guys trade with? So far I have been using 1-minute candles but I find them too quick and hectic so I am wanting to switch something longer like 5 or 10-minute long ones. Of course it means possibly fewer, bigger trades but I am not sure. What do you guys use or what are your experiences? Is there an ""industry standard""?
2. Which indicators do you guys use? I have been experimenting with Bollinger bands (both with 2 and 3 SD), Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic for signalling oversold/overbought combined with the T-line, a 50 period moving average, MACD and volume of course. Is there something I am missing. What are the things that work for you and why?
3. What kind of news outlet do you guys use? So far I have been reading the free version of CNBC which is kind of okay for giving a general overview of what is happening in the market but I think not fast and focused enough to help with day trading where. Do you have industry or even stock specific news outlets that you think are keeping up with the happenings?
4. What advice would you give to the version of yourself who is starting to get into day trading today?

Thanks if you take the time to read my post and reply, I really appreciate it.",12-12-2024

# Amazon Adds 'Car Shopping' to Its Cart

Amazon is taking your online shopping spree to a whole new level‚Äîcars.¬†

The retail behemoth just launched¬†*Amazon Autos*, letting you shop for a Hyundai like you would for an air fryer. Except instead of a Prime box at your door, you‚Äôll pick it up at a dealership.

**The Details: Click, Scroll, Drive**  
  
Amazon Autos is debuting in 48 U.S. cities with Hyundai as its exclusive partner. Buyers can browse new models, customize trims and colors, estimate trade-in values, secure financing, and e-sign paperwork‚Äîall on Amazon‚Äôs platform. What you won‚Äôt get? Free two-day delivery. You‚Äôll still have to visit the dealership to drive off in your new ride.

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is throwing in a $2,300 gift card for purchases made before January 10. Think of it as gas money, or, knowing Amazon, a chance to stock up on Alexa devices for your car.

**Why It Matters: Bye-Bye, Dealership Drama?**  
  
Car buying is infamous for its soul-draining haggling. Amazon promises to take that headache out of the equation by showing transparent, haggle-free pricing at checkout‚Äîtaxes and fees included. Unlike Tesla‚Äôs direct-to-consumer model, Amazon keeps dealerships in the mix, playing the ultimate middleman. Hyundai dealers sell the cars; Amazon makes the process easier (or so they claim).  
  
Here‚Äôs the fine print: Amazon Autos is only offering new Hyundai vehicles‚Äîno used cars, no other brands (yet). Leasing and more expansive financing options are expected to roll out next year. Still, Amazon is clearly testing the waters, setting itself up as the one-click king of car buying.

**Bigger Picture: A New Gear for E-Commerce**  
  
This move isn‚Äôt just about Hyundai. It‚Äôs a clear sign Amazon is eyeing the future of car shopping, where the experience is more app-friendly than awkward-salesperson-at-a-dealership. Rivals like Carvana and CarMax should take note.

If Amazon pulls this off, imagine adding a car to your cart alongside your groceries.¬†

# Apple‚Äôs AI Ambitions Take Shape with Broadcom Partnership

Apple is stepping up its game in artificial intelligence, teaming up with Broadcom to create its first AI-focused server chip, code-named¬†*Baltra*. Slated for mass production by 2026, this custom silicon marks Apple‚Äôs latest move to reduce its reliance on Nvidia‚Äôs chips while carving out a space in the lucrative AI hardware race.

**Broadcom‚Äôs Boost**  
  
Broadcom shares climbed 5% on the news, reflecting the market‚Äôs enthusiasm for this partnership. Apple and Broadcom are reportedly prioritizing the chip's networking technology‚Äîa critical piece for handling the high demands of AI processing in the cloud. Apple is expected to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.‚Äôs (TSMC) cutting-edge N3P process for¬†*Baltra*.

This isn‚Äôt Apple‚Äôs first foray into chip design. The tech giant has successfully replaced Intel in its MacBooks with its in-house M-series processors, and now it‚Äôs channeling that expertise into server hardware to support AI applications.

**Catching Up in AI**  
  
While Apple has been slow to roll out generative AI compared to its Big Tech rivals, it‚Äôs starting to show signs of catching up. Recent¬†*Apple Intelligence*¬†features, including integrations for Siri and Maps, aim to leverage AI directly on devices. But for more compute-heavy tasks, Apple‚Äôs cloud infrastructure needs a serious upgrade‚Äîwhich is where¬†*Baltra*comes in.

**Broadcom‚Äôs Winning Streak**  
  
Broadcom has become a top beneficiary of the generative AI boom, with shares up 54% this year following a massive rally in 2023. The company‚Äôs role in Apple‚Äôs AI chip ambitions further solidifies its standing in a market that could grow to $45 billion by 2028.

While Apple‚Äôs efforts won‚Äôt dethrone Nvidia anytime soon, the company‚Äôs pivot toward in-house AI hardware signals a strategic move to future-proof its ecosystem‚Äîand ensure Siri doesn‚Äôt get left in the dust.

The Producer Price Index (PPI) steps into the inflation spotlight next, offering a look at how prices are trending for the companies behind the goods and services we consume. While the CPI tracks costs for consumers, PPI is a wholesale measure of inflation that provides critical insights into the broader economic picture, even if it doesn‚Äôt get as much buzz.

In October, PPI remained flat month-over-month and rose 1.8% year-over-year. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, jumped 2.8%. Economists are watching closely for November‚Äôs reading, expecting a slight moderation to 2.5% annually. Meanwhile, the Fed‚Äôs other priority‚Äîemployment‚Äîgets a check-in tomorrow with jobless claims data.

# Google‚Äôs Quantum Chip Willow Stuns the World¬†

Five minutes. That‚Äôs how long it took Google‚Äôs latest quantum chip, Willow, to solve a problem that would‚Äôve kept the world‚Äôs best supercomputers grinding away for 10 septillion years‚Äîyes, septillion. While that might sound like a flex without a purpose, it‚Äôs a major leap toward making quantum computing commercially useful.

**Qubits, But Make Them Work**

Quantum computing isn‚Äôt just sci-fi anymore. Google‚Äôs Willow chip tackled the tech‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel: scaling without drowning in errors.¬†

Unlike regular bits (your standard 1s and 0s), qubits can exist in multiple states at once, offering ridiculous speed-ups for tasks like drug discovery, nuclear simulations, and‚Äîironically‚Äîbuilding better quantum computers. Willow‚Äôs big win? Adding more qubits without breaking the system. For the first time, more power didn‚Äôt equal more chaos.

**Stocks and Supercomputers**

Wall Street loved the news. Alphabet‚Äôs stock popped 5.6% on Tuesday, its biggest rally since April. Analysts cheered the milestone as a signal that Google is still a tech powerhouse, even as rivals like IBM and Amazon race to claim the quantum crown. Meanwhile, smaller quantum players like Rigetti Computing rode Alphabet‚Äôs coattails, with Rigetti shares skyrocketing 45%.

But don‚Äôt expect quantum computing to replace your MacBook anytime soon. Willow is still experimental, and mainstream adoption is years off. Still, this win positions Google as a frontrunner in what could be the next trillion-dollar tech race.

**The Quantum-verse Ahead**

What‚Äôs next? Google‚Äôs looking to solve a ‚Äúreal-world, beyond-classical‚Äù problem‚Äîone no classical computer could handle. Think unlocking new drugs or optimizing supply chains at a scale we can barely imagine. And let‚Äôs not ignore the cybersecurity elephant in the room: quantum computers could crack today‚Äôs strongest encryptions, which is why Apple‚Äôs already working on quantum-proofing iMessage.

For now, quantum remains a playground for big brains and bigger budgets, but with breakthroughs like Willow, it‚Äôs clear the future of computing is arriving at warp speed.

# Oracle's Cloudy Day

Oracle‚Äôs stock just hit a rough patch, sliding 6.7%‚Äîits steepest drop this year‚Äîafter posting earnings that left Wall Street less than thrilled. Despite a stellar 69% rally in 2024 (its best since the dot-com era), the database titan missed some lofty expectations.

**The Numbers Game**

* Revenue: $14.06 billion (+9% YoY), just shy of the $14.1 billion estimate.
* Adjusted EPS: $1.47, a penny below expectations.
* Cloud infrastructure: A bright spot, with revenue jumping 52% to $2.4 billion.

Even with these solid gains, Oracle‚Äôs guidance for next quarter came in lighter than hoped, with projected revenue of $14.3 billion missing Wall Street‚Äôs $14.65 billion target.

**What Went Right (and Wrong)**

Oracle‚Äôs cloud business has been the growth engine, riding the AI wave with big-name clients like Meta and TikTok. But here‚Äôs the rub: Scaling up to meet demand isn‚Äôt cheap. The company shelled out nearly $4 billion in capital expenditures this quarter to build its data centers, raising some eyebrows on Wall Street.

Still, Oracle isn‚Äôt crying over spilled capex. Meta recently signed a deal to use Oracle‚Äôs infrastructure for its Llama AI models, and the company projects 50% growth in its cloud business for next year.

**The Bigger Picture**

While this quarter wasn‚Äôt perfect, analysts see Oracle‚Äôs long-term AI play as promising. Piper Sandler even upped their price target to $210, citing strong cloud momentum. So, while investors may be feeling the sting today, Oracle‚Äôs future still looks bright‚Äîif it can keep up with its competitors in the cloud race.

Oracle‚Äôs earnings might have stumbled, but its cloud ambitions are still flying high. For now, Wall Street‚Äôs patience seems to be holding.

# 

# Inflation ‚Äî Still Hanging Around Like That Guest Who Won‚Äôt Leave

The CPI report dropping tomorrow is expected to show inflation holding firm at an annualized 2.7% for November. Core CPI‚Äîexcluding food and energy‚Äîlooks to stay steady at 3.3%, which means the Fed‚Äôs dream of a 2% inflation target isn‚Äôt quite ready for prime time.

**Why This Matters**

The Fed has been slicing interest rates like it‚Äôs carving a holiday turkey, with two cuts already in the books this year and whispers of another quarter-point trim next week. Futures markets are betting heavily (88% odds) that Jerome Powell will deliver. But with inflation progress slowing, some analysts wonder if the Fed should tap the brakes on its rate-cutting spree.

**What‚Äôs Driving Prices Up?**

Goldman Sachs pointed to the usual suspects: car prices (+2% in November), airfares (+1%), and that ever-irritating auto insurance (+0.5% for the month). Sure, inflation is way down from its 9% peak in 2022, but persistent price increases still feel like a splinter under the skin for many consumers, especially those on tight budgets.

**Looking Ahead**

Economists are split on what 2025 holds. On one hand, easing in housing rentals and autos might give inflation some breathing room. On the other, Trump‚Äôs proposed tariffs could shake things up, keeping core CPI stubbornly high at 2.7% for the year. Add potential tax cuts and immigration policy shifts to the mix, and you‚Äôve got a recipe for more inflation drama.

So, what‚Äôs next? Tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report could either solidify the Fed‚Äôs plan to cut rates‚Äîor throw in a curveball. Stay tuned for the 8:30 a.m. ET drop, because this report might just dictate whether 2025 starts with cautious optimism or a side of economic uncertainty.

# Tomorrow

Still talking about inflation? Unfortunately, yes. Tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report is the last data drop before the Fed huddles up next week to decide on its next rate move.

While inflation‚Äôs grip has loosened compared to the peaks of recent years, the final stretch is proving tricky, with shelter prices refusing to play nice. November‚Äôs inflation is expected to rise 0.2%, matching October. If the number creeps higher, a December rate cut might be wishful thinking for investors.

"Microsoft founder placed  2 billion dollars short positionThere is an article on NY Times who talk about the massive  2 billion dollarts short on tesla made by bill gates.

As Tesla stock price rises to all time highs, Bill Gates'  made 2 billion dollars short position against Tesla is looking increasingly dangerous as the EV maker's stock surges past $400, with analysts eyeing $420.69 as the next target. 

With Tesla's market cap hitting $1.2 trillion and Trump's support potentially supercharging growth, Gates' bearish bet could turn catastrophic.

The Microsoft founder placed his multi-billion dollar short when Tesla was at its weakest‚Äînow it's up 56.6% this year alone, crushing the S&P 500's 27.7% gain.

 If Elon's prediction of Tesla becoming ""the world's most valuable company by far"" comes true, Gates' position could indeed lead to financial disaster.

Between Tesla's planned sub-$30k EV, robotaxi ambitions, and Elon's direct line to the incoming Trump administration, Gates might want to check if his short position is still covered by Microsoft's insurance 



Two questions come to my mind : 

What role could the incoming Trump administration potentially play in Tesla's future growth?

Which financial advisor recommended Bill Gates short Tesla with $2 billion?

Ok 2 billion for him it's peanuts .",12-10-2024

Shorted TSLA today - nice entry and exit !,12-09-2024
"TSLA Is Going To Tank Next Week - The Classic 4 Indicator Divergence Confirmation[TSLA Flush About To Happen](https://preview.redd.it/9wxy7aiegi5e1.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b88e95ac4a6d936bf3999228308b273c9c1a60)

Despite all the excitement regarding TSLA lately, it's setting up for a great flush.  Any time you have 4+ indicators (e.g. RSI, MACD, Stochastic RSI, MFI) showing a significant divergence, 90+% of the time it only takes 1-5 trading days for a major correction.  Will it surpass it's all time high?  Eventually yes, but I'd be shocked if it happened before the New Years and only after a correction.  If it happens to continue to climb, all those sandbaggers that held this stupid stock for 3 years waiting to break even are going to dump it hard so either way it's going down in the coming days/weeks.

"Trying to understand the market on a deeper level, a few questions:Hello, I'm new to trading and I want to learn the stockmarket on a deeper level. I have a couple of questions I would love to have answered. Also, I would greatly appreciate references to articles or tips on any further reading.

1. Does stock expensiveness affect stock performance. For example, will a stock valued at 10$ behave differently than a stock valued at 100$ given that they're traded at similar rates. I understand that in general there may be more growth potential for the cheaper stock, but are there any other differences? 

2. How accurate are indicators? Things like RSI and ATX, I understand that these are applicable in some circumstances, but in general, how useful are they? Also, as far as I understand these measurements are quite old, do they still hold up, if not, are there any indicators that people use more frequently today?

  
3. My understanding of economy is pretty basic - basically supply demand. However, it feels like demand can be manipulated by certain factors suchs as group-think. For example, I hear Nvidia and Tesla are overvalued but they are still expensive on the market, presumably because of trader psychology. Following this logic - is trading of stocks based of ""vibes"" profitable as long as you know to sell before the burst?

4. For swing-trading, is it preferable to learn everything about companies in a specific sector, or is a more diverse understanding of macro-economics and geopolitics preferable?

# BlackRock Hops On The Private Credit Train

When you‚Äôre the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, what‚Äôs your next play? Apparently, buying one of the biggest private-credit firms out there. BlackRock announced it‚Äôs acquiring HPS Investment Partners in a $12 billion all-stock deal to dive headfirst into the $2 trillion private credit pool.

HPS‚Äôs leadership will head a new private financing unit at BlackRock, which now boasts $220 billion in private credit assets‚Äîvaulting it into the top five globally. For CEO Larry Fink, this isn‚Äôt just a win; it‚Äôs a power move to dominate a market that‚Äôs swelling faster than a fintech IPO in 2021.

**Private Credit 101: Wall Street‚Äôs Current Obsession**

Think of private credit as the financial world‚Äôs VIP lending room. Instead of going to a bank or going public, mid-sized companies borrow directly from firms like HPS. The payoff? High interest rates mean juicy returns for investors.

At nearly $2 trillion and projected to hit $2.7 trillion by 2027, the private credit market is booming. But here‚Äôs the kicker: it‚Äôs mostly for institutions and high-net-worth players. Asset managers like BlackRock are now angling to let more investors join the party.

**BlackRock‚Äôs Grand Plan**

This isn‚Äôt BlackRock‚Äôs first rodeo in alternative assets. With the HPS deal, its third major acquisition this year, the firm‚Äôs private-market AUM jumps 40%. Add this to a $12.5 billion deal for Global Infrastructure Partners and a $3.2 billion scoop of Preqin, and Larry Fink‚Äôs building a serious alt-assets empire.

Why it matters: Private credit is high-margin, high-growth, and a hedge against the volatility of public markets. By snapping up HPS, BlackRock isn‚Äôt just joining the private credit gold rush‚Äîit‚Äôs angling to lead it.

# Apple Accused Of Snooping On Workers‚Äô iPhones In New Lawsuit

Apple‚Äôs reputation for safeguarding privacy is facing a legal challenge‚Äîthis time from one of its own.¬†

A lawsuit filed by advertising tech worker Amar Bhakta accuses the company of overstepping its bounds by surveilling employees‚Äô personal devices and data. According to Bhakta, Apple encourages workers to use personal iPhones for work, which subjects private data like emails, photos, and even real-time locations to company oversight.

The suit, lodged under California‚Äôs Private Attorneys General Act, claims Apple‚Äôs policies force employees to choose between privacy and job functionality. While Apple allows workers to use company devices, Bhakta alleges that using personal devices is practically the norm and that linking personal iCloud accounts to work devices grants Apple far-reaching access.

**The Surveillance Allegation**

Bhakta‚Äôs lawsuit paints a stark picture: Apple employees, it argues, live under constant surveillance akin to a ‚Äúprison yard.‚Äù The suit claims that Apple reserves the right to monitor not only company-issued devices but also personal ones used for work purposes.¬†

It also alleges the company suppresses employee speech, citing examples where Bhakta was prohibited from speaking publicly about his digital advertising role or including details on his LinkedIn profile.

Apple denies these claims, with a spokesperson stating, ‚ÄúEvery employee has the right to discuss their wages, hours, and working conditions,‚Äù and maintaining that the policies align with its business conduct standards.

**Why It Matters**

This case sheds light on a tension unique to Big Tech employees‚Äîwhere personal privacy clashes with workplace security. While Apple has long marketed itself as a privacy-first company, the lawsuit forces the question: Does the company's internal culture live up to its customer-facing promises?

The lawsuit also comes at a delicate moment. As Apple shifts focus to its AI strategy, ‚ÄúApple Intelligence,‚Äù it continues to brand itself as the privacy-conscious alternative. However, such litigation risks exposing cracks in its own ecosystem, particularly as rivals like Google and Amazon face similar accusations of employee surveillance.

The outcome of this case could ripple beyond Apple, influencing tech workplace norms and policies around personal data and surveillance. For now, it‚Äôs another chapter in the ongoing story of privacy in an ever-connected world.

# Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger Out

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is stepping down, but not on his own terms.¬†

The board effectively pushed him out after frustrations over slow progress in regaining Intel‚Äôs footing in the semiconductor race. CFO David Zinsner and products leader Michelle Johnston Holthaus will serve as interim co-CEOs while the search for a permanent replacement begins.

Gelsinger‚Äôs tenure, which began in 2021, was marked by ambitious goals to revamp Intel‚Äôs manufacturing and compete with global leaders like Nvidia and TSMC. But his high-cost turnaround strategy failed to deliver results quickly enough for the board or investors. Shares have plummeted 61% during his tenure, and the company continues to face setbacks in both revenue and innovation.

**Stuck in the Chips Slow Lane**

Intel‚Äôs struggles go beyond Gelsinger. The company has long lagged behind in advanced chip production and missed opportunities in the AI boom‚Äîan area now dominated by Nvidia. Efforts to expand into foundry services, manufacturing chips for other companies, drained cash reserves without attracting major clients. Meanwhile, competitors gained market share in lucrative AI and data center sectors.

The board‚Äôs frustration reportedly came to a head over the lack of compelling products and the slow pace of Intel‚Äôs transformation into a contract chip manufacturer. While Gelsinger advocated for staying the course, the board decided it was time for a change, signaling potential strategic pivots ahead.

**A Tall Order for the Next CEO**

Whoever takes the reins will inherit a daunting task. Intel faces mounting challenges: catching up in AI chips, competing with better-funded rivals, and balancing a capital-intensive foundry business with waning investor confidence. The company also has $50 billion in debt, a stark contrast to its cash-rich days of dominating the semiconductor market.

Some analysts suggest Intel may need to spin off its foundry division to focus on core chip design, while others predict deeper cost cuts. Either way, the new CEO will need to act decisively to stabilize the business‚Äîand fast. As Intel grapples with its place in a rapidly changing industry, the stakes have never been higher.

# Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated

Elon Musk‚Äôs record $56 billion Tesla pay package has hit another roadblock. A Delaware judge upheld her earlier ruling voiding the 2018 compensation plan, despite a recent shareholder vote attempting to reinstate it. Judge Kathaleen McCormick criticized Tesla‚Äôs board for its lack of independence in approving the deal, citing undue influence from Musk.

The package, originally worth $2.6 billion and ballooning to $101.5 billion by today‚Äôs share prices, was the largest in U.S. corporate history. With the court‚Äôs decision, Tesla shareholders have effectively slashed Musk‚Äôs prospective payout‚Äîthough his existing wealth, buoyed by Tesla‚Äôs stock rally, keeps him securely at the top of the billionaire leaderboard.

**Shareholders Step In, Court Stands Firm**

Tesla had hoped a June shareholder vote to ratify the pay plan would override McCormick‚Äôs concerns, but the judge wasn‚Äôt swayed. McCormick called the vote legally ineffective, refusing to accept what she termed ‚Äúnew facts‚Äù created to revise prior rulings. Tesla‚Äôs board now faces a dilemma: how to keep Musk incentivized without igniting further shareholder backlash or legal trouble.

In addition to voiding the pay plan, McCormick approved $345 million in attorney fees for the plaintiff‚Äôs legal team‚Äîa fraction of their initial $5.6 billion request but still among the highest awards in U.S. litigation history. Musk‚Äôs legal team has 30 days to decide whether to appeal.

**Bigger Battles Ahead**

This setback isn‚Äôt likely to slow Musk down. Tesla stock has surged 42% since Donald Trump‚Äôs election win, fueled by expectations that Musk‚Äôs ties to the incoming administration will yield business-friendly policies. However, with Tesla‚Äôs incorporation recently shifted to Texas and the legal dispute unresolved, uncertainty looms.

Musk‚Äôs influence over Tesla‚Äôs board and shareholder dynamics continues to draw scrutiny, and any new compensation plan will likely face similar challenges. Meanwhile, the billionaire‚Äôs ventures in AI, electric vehicles, and space exploration keep him at the forefront of industry and political intrigue‚Äîwhether or not his paychecks match his ambitions.

"1 month progress daytrading Hi,

  
i have been daytrading now since 18th of October and I have made a total of 19% profit, 17% month to date and 9% since last week with total profit of 370$ since I started. this last two trading days I have been lucky with SMCI I made almost 4% each day.

today I bought SMCI at 42.4$ and sold at 44.1$, I could have bought it at 37.5$ but I want not sure if the stock would pullback or if it will continue trending I didn't expect it to reach over 30% profit in one day, I thought it would drop after 20% so I didn't buy it early.

my trading strategy works for me so far and I'm happy with it but I'm not sure if I'm just lucky because the market is bullish, I don't really read the indicators even though I have them on my chart I feel like they add to much noise for daytrading they might help me make a decision to enter but I have found heikin ashi candles reliable for me I would just switch timeframes to confirm trends and momentum better than any indicator I used so far.

i have been reading old post and I saw I a term being used, trades looking like a watermelon green from the outside and red from inside, and I'm not really sure if that is a bad thing because it been happening to me a lot I would buy stocks they would turn red for 1-4 hours then they would turn green and I'm happy with this strategy, do I really need to time my enter to be considered a good daytrader or as long as I make profit at the end of the day I would be considered good?.

some days I would make 0.1-0.3% some days I would make 1-2% my best was 3.91$ which is today.

my risk management is 2% stop loss but if I expect the stock to turn red I might cancel the stop loss and let it drop even to 4% monitor the stock over 4 hours before deciding to sell and some times it would rebound to make 1$ profit, since I started I only sold at loss twice at 1% each time it was a tesla stock I know I could have held the stock for few days and made a lot more profit but I was trying to focus on learning to daytrade.

do you think i can continue making around 9% monthly or would my luck run out?

open to hear any critiques and appreciate any advice.

# Trump‚Äôs Tariff Talk Shakes Markets

President-elect Donald Trump isn‚Äôt wasting time stirring the pot. On Monday, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping tariffs: 25% on all goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The announcement sent shockwaves through global markets, rattling investors and drawing sharp criticism from trading partners.

Mexico‚Äôs peso and Canada‚Äôs dollar took immediate hits, while the U.S. dollar gained. Auto manufacturers reliant on cross-border supply chains‚Äîlike General Motors and Ford‚Äîsaw shares tumble, while Walmart and Costco, less dependent on foreign goods, stayed resilient. Economists warn these tariffs could drive up consumer prices and reignite inflation, cutting household purchasing power.

# Trade Tensions Heat Up

Trump framed the tariffs as a crackdown on illegal immigration and drug trafficking, accusing Mexico and Canada of enabling the flow of fentanyl and migrants into the U.S. The move also targets China for failing to curb fentanyl precursor shipments. But critics argue the strategy could backfire, raising costs for U.S. businesses and households while inviting retaliatory tariffs.

The fallout extends beyond trade. Trump‚Äôs approach disrupts the USMCA, a trade deal he championed during his first term, and risks undoing years of economic integration between the three nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has already reached out to Trump, highlighting Canada‚Äôs efforts to combat fentanyl trafficking and underscoring the interdependence of their economies.

# From Rhetoric to Reality

While Trump‚Äôs tariff threats are rattling markets, they‚Äôre far from finalized. Analysts suggest the president-elect may be using them as leverage for future negotiations. Historically, Trump‚Äôs tariff announcements have often softened during policy implementation.

Still, the potential economic fallout is significant. A 25% tariff on Canadian energy, for instance, could spike U.S. energy prices, while auto tariffs threaten North America‚Äôs deeply intertwined manufacturing sector. Investors will be watching closely as Trump‚Äôs trade policies take shape, with global markets bracing for the next chapter of tariff drama.

# Fed: Slow and Steady Wins the Rate Cut Race

The Federal Reserve isn‚Äôt rushing to slash rates. Minutes from the November meeting reveal a collective preference for a cautious, gradual approach to future cuts. Officials voted unanimously to lower rates to 4.5%-4.75% earlier this month, but they‚Äôre eyeing the road ahead carefully, given the delicate balance between inflation control and economic stability.

Inflation is cooling‚Äîalbeit slowly‚Äîand the labor market remains solid. Policymakers emphasized the importance of moving gradually toward a ‚Äúneutral‚Äù rate, the elusive sweet spot that neither stokes nor restrains growth. While inflation has eased significantly from its peak, Fed officials noted that housing costs remain sticky, even as rents show signs of slowing.

# The Balancing Act

The Fed‚Äôs next move could be a tough call. On one hand, inflation progress gives them room to ease rates. On the other, uncertainties around President-elect Trump‚Äôs tariff threats and the neutral rate complicate the picture. Officials even discussed hitting pause on cuts if inflation proves more stubborn or accelerating them if the economy starts wobbling.

But for now, the consensus is clear: don‚Äôt rock the boat. The Fed wants to avoid undoing recent progress on inflation while ensuring rate cuts don‚Äôt inadvertently reignite asset bubbles or overheating.

# Markets Play the Waiting Game

Investors aren‚Äôt exactly throwing confetti over December rate cut odds. The likelihood of another reduction has dipped below 60%, as concerns over inflation and Trump‚Äôs economic agenda weigh on expectations. Markets are taking cues from a labor market that remains sturdy, with minimal layoffs, and a steady economy that keeps chugging along.

Bottom line? The Fed‚Äôs strategy seems to be a slow, measured path forward‚Äîgradually easing rates while keeping a close watch on inflation‚Äôs next move. It‚Äôs the monetary policy equivalent of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mess this up.‚Äù For the economy‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs hope they stick the landing.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

With Wall Street gearing up for the holidays, the earnings calendar is quiet tomorrow, but economic data isn‚Äôt taking a break. Wednesday brings a trio of key updates to keep an eye on before the turkey hits the table:

First up is the weekly jobless claims report, arriving a day early. Last week‚Äôs claims hit a seven-month low, and with seasonal hiring in full swing, economists expect that trend to continue as we head into the busiest shopping season of the year.

Next, we‚Äôll get a revised look at last quarter‚Äôs GDP. While it‚Äôs not the final number, this update gives a clearer snapshot of how the economy is faring. And rounding things out is the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE)‚Äîthe Fed‚Äôs go-to inflation gauge. Core PCE, which skips volatile food and energy prices, is expected to show a slight uptick but should confirm that inflation is steadily cooling.¬†",11-26-2024

# A Wall Street Favorite Heads to Treasury

Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for Treasury Secretary is straight from the hedge fund A-list: Scott Bessent, a former George Soros lieutenant and founder of Key Square Capital.¬†

With his deep market chops, Bessent is Wall Street‚Äôs answer to an economic pep talk, signaling that Trump‚Äôs America First policies will still play nice with investors. Markets took the news in stride‚Äîstock futures ticked up, bond yields dipped, and analysts let out a collective ‚Äúphew.‚Äù

Bessent is no stranger to bold moves, having famously called the collapse of the British pound in the 1990s. Now, he‚Äôs tasked with managing America‚Äôs $25 trillion debt, tax policy, and tariffs‚Äîwhile keeping the economy humming.¬†

In Trump‚Äôs words, he‚Äôs here to ‚Äústop unfair trade imbalances‚Äù and, ideally, boost growth without spooking the markets.

# Tariffs, Growth, and a Balancing Act

Bessent‚Äôs ‚Äú3-3-3‚Äù framework‚Äî3% GDP growth, 3% budget deficits, and 3 million extra barrels of oil production a day‚Äîsets the tone for his playbook. He‚Äôs on board with Trump‚Äôs tariff crusade but insists on phasing them in slowly, a strategy that keeps inflation at bay while giving manufacturers time to adjust.¬†

For Wall Street, it‚Äôs a mix of pragmatism and pro-growth optimism‚Äîjust the kind of fiscal hawk they like.

But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing. Bessent will have to tango with Howard Lutnick, Trump‚Äôs pick for Commerce Secretary, who‚Äôs seen as more aggressive on trade. Navigating these dynamics while steering the economy could be as challenging as convincing Elon Musk that Bessent wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúbusiness-as-usual‚Äù choice.

# First Impressions

Wall Street‚Äôs early reviews are glowing. Deutsche Bank called him the ‚Äúperfect fit,‚Äù and Evercore strategists said markets ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt have done much better.‚Äù Even so, some political voices, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, aren‚Äôt sold. Her take? Bessent‚Äôs loyalties may lean more toward his hedge fund peers than everyday workers.

The real question: can Bessent keep both Trump and the markets happy? If history is any guide, it‚Äôs a tall order. But with his market-tested r√©sum√© and knack for strategy, he‚Äôs got the tools to pull it off‚Äîor at least keep things interesting. Let the fiscal drama begin.

# Macy‚Äôs Says Accounting Employee Hid Up to $154 Million in Delivery Expenses

What‚Äôs worse than messing up at work? How about hiding over $150 million in expenses?¬†

Macy‚Äôs dropped a bombshell Monday, revealing that a single employee concealed delivery costs between 2021 and now, forcing the retailer to delay its third-quarter earnings report. The employee, who‚Äôs no longer at Macy‚Äôs (shocker), stashed the costs through creative accounting entries that even auditors at KPMG didn‚Äôt catch.

Macy‚Äôs says the accounting hiccup didn‚Äôt impact its cash flow or vendor payments, but investors aren‚Äôt thrilled‚Äîshares fell 2% on the news. Preliminary results show a 2.4% sales dip to $4.74 billion last quarter, slightly outpacing Wall Street‚Äôs expectations. Still, the retailer‚Äôs stock has had a rough year, down 21% while the S&P 500 soared 26%.

# A Tough Look for Macy‚Äôs

This mess comes as CEO Tony Spring tries to revive Macy‚Äôs fortunes. The company is shutting underperforming stores, sprucing up top locations, and leaning into luxury with brands like Bloomingdale‚Äôs and Bluemercury. Early results show promise: Bloomingdale‚Äôs posted a 3.2% sales boost, and Bluemercury kept its 15-quarter growth streak alive with a 3.3% jump.

But the accounting scandal throws a wrench in the narrative. Analysts are questioning Macy‚Äôs internal controls and wondering how KPMG missed years of accounting sleight of hand. It‚Äôs not a great look for a retailer already battling declining store traffic and cautious shoppers.

# Can Macy‚Äôs Win Back Trust?

Macy‚Äôs plans to release its full earnings and updated guidance by Dec. 11, hoping to shift the spotlight back to its holiday shopping performance. Early signs are encouraging: November sales are trending ahead of Q3 levels, thanks to investments in select stores and a solid start to the gift-buying season.

Still, the delayed earnings report raises questions about management oversight and whether Macy‚Äôs can keep pace with competitors during the all-important holiday stretch. For now, let‚Äôs just hope the Thanksgiving Day Parade goes off without a hitch‚Äîbecause nobody wants a Snoopy-sized scandal.

# Tesla Stock Pops After Report Trump Wants To Relax U.S. Self-Driving Rules

Tesla stock zoomed over 5% on Monday after news broke that Trump‚Äôs transition team is hitting the gas pedal on federal self-driving car regulations.¬†

For Musk, this feels like a scripted Hollywood plot: championing Trump‚Äôs return to the White House and now potentially reaping the rewards. The potential framework would dismantle red tape, allowing Tesla to scale its futuristic Cybercab and Robovan models beyond the current 2,500-unit limit. Forget steering wheels and pedals‚ÄîMusk‚Äôs robotaxi vision might finally leave the station.

**Regulatory Road Trip**  
  
Trump‚Äôs transition team has ambitious plans to reshape how autonomous vehicles hit the streets. Key names like former Uber exec Emil Michael and policy-minded Republican reps are being floated for leadership at the Department of Transportation.

Musk‚Äôs dream of making driverless Teslas mainstream‚Äîthink fleets of robotaxis chauffeuring passengers without human backup‚Äîis closer than ever, thanks to these early-stage efforts. Cue the popcorn.

**Winners, Losers, and Sideliners**  
  
While Tesla basked in market love, Uber and Lyft investors weren‚Äôt thrilled, with both stocks dropping over 6%.¬†

Musk‚Äôs robotaxis could eventually outprice and outpace ridesharing apps. Meanwhile, Waymo and GM‚Äôs Cruise might feel the heat, as they‚Äôve played it safe by sticking to autonomous cars with traditional controls. For Tesla, the stakes are clear: dominate the robotaxi race or stay stuck in regulatory limbo.

**Is This the Green Light?**  
  
Musk‚Äôs close ties to the incoming administration position Tesla as a frontrunner in the race for autonomous dominance. But before anyone pops champagne, Congress still needs to clear the road for mass deployment.¬†

If Trump‚Äôs team can pull this off, Musk‚Äôs long-promised vision could go from moonshot to market reality‚Äîsteering the conversation and, potentially, the future of mobility.

# Super Micro Climbs Out of the Abyss

**A Compliance Comeback?**  
  
Super Micro Computer, a server maker basking in the AI boom spotlight, made a dramatic leap in after-hours trading, with shares spiking over 37%.¬†

The catalyst? A Hail Mary compliance plan filed with Nasdaq, complete with a new auditor‚ÄîBDO USA‚Äîto replace Ernst & Young, who bailed last month citing governance concerns. Investors seem to believe Super Micro‚Äôs cleanup effort might actually stick this time.

**Scandals, Probes, and Short Sellers‚ÄîOh My!**  
  
The road here hasn‚Äôt exactly been smooth. Super Micro delayed its financial filings this summer, prompting a short-seller hit piece from Hindenburg Research and a DOJ probe.

Toss in a Nasdaq delisting warning, and this once $70 billion darling now finds itself valued at a mere $12.6 billion. Still, its pivot to AI-focused hardware has kept it relevant‚Äîand kept its ticker on traders' watchlists.

**AI Keeps the Lights On**  
  
Super Micro continues to ride Nvidia‚Äôs AI wave, unveiling products powered by the chipmaker‚Äôs shiny new Blackwell processors. That‚Äôs a big win in a market obsessed with AI innovation.¬†

But let‚Äôs not get carried away‚ÄîWall Street‚Äôs excitement is tempered by the company‚Äôs checkered financial reporting history and underwhelming guidance.

**Will It Stick?**¬†With its Nasdaq fate hanging in the balance until February, Super Micro has a lot to prove. The company‚Äôs internal governance overhaul and fresh promises to meet filing deadlines could keep it afloat‚Äîif they deliver. For now, investors are cautiously optimistic, but like all good cliffhangers, we‚Äôll have to wait to see how this one ends.

# Vaccine Stocks Catch a Cold on Kennedy's Nomination

Vaccine stocks felt the pain Thursday after President-elect Trump tapped Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vocal vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).¬†

With Kennedy‚Äôs track record of challenging vaccine safety, investors quickly hit sell on big names. Moderna ($MRNA) slid 5.6%, Novavax ($NVAX) lost 7%, while Pfizer ($PFE) and BioNTech ($BNTX) joined the red tide.¬†

The market‚Äôs verdict? Kennedy‚Äôs policies could shake up the sector, potentially eroding public confidence and tightening regulations.

**Uncertain Times for Vaccine Makers**  
  
For an industry already coping with waning COVID-19 vaccine demand, Kennedy‚Äôs HHS role injects new uncertainty. His anti-vaccine advocacy‚Äîand leadership of Children‚Äôs Health Defense, an anti-vax group‚Äîhas industry players and investors bracing for possible policy headwinds.¬†

Vaccine manufacturers now face the risk of reduced immunization rates, which could pressure their bottom lines even further.

**Biotech Takes Note**  
  
Kennedy‚Äôs views extend beyond vaccines, casting a shadow over the wider biotech sector. With his skepticism about pharmaceutical companies, market watchers anticipate potential shifts in health policy that could impact drug development, approval timelines, and sales.¬†

Analysts are on alert, viewing Kennedy‚Äôs influence as a wildcard that could affect drugmakers‚Äô performance across the board.

**Stock Market Reaction**  
  
The market is clearly concerned, and health stocks could be in for a bumpy ride if Kennedy‚Äôs nomination is confirmed.¬†

With his anti-establishment approach, the biotech and vaccine sectors might see a heightened level of volatility, as investors weigh the long-term effects of Kennedy‚Äôs potential policy pivots on the healthcare landscape.

# Spirit Airlines Braces for Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines is flirting with bankruptcy after a last-ditch merger attempt with Frontier fizzled out.¬†

The ultra-budget airline is now in talks with creditors on a restructuring plan that would potentially wipe out its equity holders, sending Spirit‚Äôs stock plummeting over 59% on Wednesday.¬†

So, if you‚Äôre holding Spirit shares, let‚Äôs just say it might be time to buckle up.

# Grounded Merger Plans Leave Spirit Scrambling

Merger hopes were high for Spirit after talks with both JetBlue and Frontier put a lifeline in sight. But after JetBlue‚Äôs bid got axed by antitrust concerns, Frontier was the next best hope ‚Äì until now.¬†

With that deal grounded, Spirit is left scrambling to negotiate its survival with bondholders. Analysts say that without a merger, Spirit may need to sell off aircraft and other assets to handle its hefty debt load, giving bondholders the upper hand over shareholders in any final deal.

# Trimming Wings to Stay Afloat

Already in belt-tightening mode, Spirit‚Äôs been trimming its fleet, furloughing pilots, and offloading older planes in a bid to free up cash.¬†

Yet, with a hefty $1.1 billion bond deadline on the horizon, the airline‚Äôs runway is looking short. Wall Street‚Äôs not holding its breath: with zero ‚Äúbuy‚Äù ratings and eight ‚Äúsell‚Äù recommendations, the consensus seems clear.¬†

Now, it‚Äôs a waiting game to see if Spirit can emerge from this nosedive intact.

# Discounts Stack as Baskets Grow

To sweeten the deal, Amazon is offering extra discounts for larger orders, with 5% off for purchases over $50 and 10% off over $75, plus free shipping on orders above $25.¬†

The Haul selection covers a broad range of categories‚Äîfrom fashion and home goods to electronics and lifestyle items‚Äîall with an eye-catching ‚Äúcrazy low‚Äù price tag. Amazon‚Äôs VP of Worldwide Selling Partner Services, Dharmesh Mehta, says Haul is designed for those willing to wait a little longer to save a lot more, adding some fun and affordability to Amazon‚Äôs app experience.

It‚Äôs a clear signal that Amazon is targeting shoppers who prioritize deals over delivery speed.

# Playing the Long Game on Low Prices

Haul isn‚Äôt just a new section; it‚Äôs Amazon‚Äôs response to the rise of bargain-focused apps like Temu, which are chipping away at the traditional e-commerce model with rock-bottom pricing.¬†

Amazon‚Äôs willingness to take the slow lane on delivery suggests a bet on customers who are still more comfortable shopping with a familiar brand but are willing to explore lower-cost options. With all products screened for compliance,¬†

Amazon is aiming to sidestep the counterfeits and regulatory issues dogging Temu and Shein, providing Haul shoppers a budget-friendly and trustworthy shopping experience.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs got two big numbers on deck: first up, initial jobless claims‚Äîa quick check on the labor market‚Äôs pulse, which is still front and center in the Fed‚Äôs rate-cutting game plan. Expect last month‚Äôs hurricane chaos and labor strikes to show up here, so don‚Äôt be surprised if the numbers look rough. Jerome Powell likely won‚Äôt hit the brakes just yet.

We‚Äôll also see the Producer Price Index (PPI), which shows inflation from the perspective of producers, not shoppers. Manufacturers have been taking it on the chin lately with rising costs and rates, but last month‚Äôs flat reading sparked a bit of hope that things might be stabilizing.

# Before Market Open:

* **Disney**¬†in trouble? Hard to imagine, but even the House of Mouse isn‚Äôt immune to a few hiccups. Box office numbers are soft, hurricanes put theme parks on pause, streaming growth is underwhelming, and sky-high sports rights are squeezing profits.

# Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Amid Trump Win

Tesla's back in the trillion-dollar club. Shares skyrocketed 8% Friday, pushing its market cap over the $1 trillion threshold as investors jumped on the potential for looser regulations in a Trump administration.¬†

Elon Musk, Trump‚Äôs most vocal supporter and a generous campaign contributor, saw Tesla surge about 30% this week alone. With hints at slashing electric vehicle subsidies and potential trade barriers for Chinese EV players, Wall Street sees a Trump-Musk partnership as a boon for Tesla‚Äôs market share in the U.S.

**A Boost for Musk‚Äôs Billions**

The Tesla rally has also catapulted Musk‚Äôs net worth past $300 billion, marking his highest fortune since 2021. Musk has been outspoken about leveraging his influence in Trump‚Äôs administration to accelerate federal approval for autonomous vehicles, a critical step for Tesla‚Äôs self-driving ambitions.¬†

The partnership comes at a strategic moment, with Tesla now vying against Alphabet-owned Waymo in the autonomous driving race.

**Trump Trade Implications for Tesla‚Äôs Competitors**

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives noted that Trump‚Äôs pro-business stance could place Musk in a highly favorable position, shielding Tesla from new EV subsidies that have leveled the field for foreign competitors.¬†

Meanwhile, U.S. rivals and industry giants like Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft now sit alongside Tesla in the trillion-dollar tech club, with Wall Street eagerly eyeing who will come out on top in this new era of deregulation.

# Market Movements

* üöÄ¬†**Tesla Hits $1 Trillion Mark:**¬†Tesla shares soared 8% on Friday, elevating the EV giant‚Äôs market cap above $1 trillion.

# Retailers Are Prepping For Tariffs

Trump‚Äôs back in office, and with him comes a tariff policy that‚Äôs sending ripples through retail. With proposed tariffs up to 20% on all imports and a jaw-dropping 100% on goods from China, retailers are facing a fresh dilemma: absorb these costs or pass them onto consumers.¬†

According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), these tariffs could add up to $7,600 in annual costs for American households, leading to what the NRF warns could be a ‚Äútax on American families.‚Äù Retail stocks like Dollar General and Five Below have already started to feel the heat, dropping as much as 10% this week as they brace for rising expenses and tightening margins.

**Consumer Prices in the Crosshairs**

Retailers are in a bind: either eat the extra costs or send prices soaring. The NRF predicts these tariffs could zap as much as $78 billion in consumer spending each year if fully enacted. Price hikes in double digits are on the horizon for categories like apparel, electronics, and household items, hitting customers‚Äô wallets hard.¬†

Stores that rely heavily on China for sourcing‚Äîlike Five Below, Crocs, and Skechers‚Äîare particularly exposed, while discount chains worry that price jumps could scare away budget-conscious shoppers.

**Winners, Losers, and Tariff-Proofing Strategies**

Not every retailer is biting their nails. Giants like Amazon and Walmart, with massive buying power and diverse supply chains, are poised to weather the tariff storm. Meanwhile, brands like Steve Madden, already seasoned from Trump‚Äôs first tariff stint, have reduced reliance on China by nearly half to sidestep a hit.¬†

As some retailers scramble, those who‚Äôve diversified early may have a head start in staying ahead of what‚Äôs shaping up to be another trade showdown.

# The Trump Trade Is So Back

With the confetti barely settled, Wall Street is jumping on the ""Trump Trade"" bandwagon, cheering on the promise of tax cuts, deregulation, and a whole lot of American-made everything.¬†

After Trump‚Äôs decisive win, investors seem ready to party like it‚Äôs 2017 all over again, driving stocks higher in celebration.

**Stocks Soaring, Banks Roaring**

In true Trump style, the biggest winners were unsurprising: Trump Media & Technology Group ticked up 6%, and Tesla shot up a whopping 15% as Elon Musk fans speculated his next role could come with a White House Cabinet badge. B

anks were also in for a big day with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo seeing double-digit gains‚Äîinvestors banking on lighter regulations are here for the ride.

Crypto fans are grinning ear-to-ear as Bitcoin hit a new high at $76,000, with Ethereum and Coinbase riding the wave of Trump‚Äôs pledge to make the U.S. the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the planet.‚Äù And oil‚Äôs back in play, with fossil-fuel giants like Exxon enjoying a lighter-touch regulatory future.

**Clean Energy, Not So Much:**¬†Not every sector is feeling the love. Green energy stocks like First Solar and Enphase Energy took a beating, down 10% and more, with the Invesco Solar ETF trailing alongside. Investors are worried Trump‚Äôs clean energy cuts could halt momentum for solar and wind.

**Bonds, the Dollar, and All That Jazz:**¬†Treasury yields popped as bondholders braced for a more inflationary, debt-ridden policy path. And the dollar? It‚Äôs on a tear, seeing its biggest gain since 2020 as a higher tariff policy puts a chill on imports, boosting the greenback.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†While Wall Street‚Äôs in a post-election high, the experts are wary. Veteran investor Leon Cooperman warned that traders might be ‚Äútoo optimistic,‚Äù and some analysts say it could be short-lived. For now, the ‚ÄúTrump Trade‚Äù seems full steam ahead, but as always in markets, it‚Äôs best to keep one hand on the exit.

# Prediction Markets Are Having Their Moment

Betting markets took a big W this week, as former President Donald Trump‚Äôs election win confirmed what sites like Kalshi and Polymarket have been shouting for weeks: the odds were in Trump‚Äôs favor, despite what the polls claimed. With bets pouring in as high as 70% for Trump on some platforms, it seems political markets may just be stealing the predictive spotlight.

Prediction markets are officially having a moment. Platforms like Kalshi, Polymarket, and even Robinhood are diving into event-based trading, allowing users to bet on anything from presidential outcomes to rainfall odds.¬†

For Wall Street pros and everyday bettors alike, these markets offer a new way to speculate‚Äîand maybe even profit‚Äîon real-world events. The appeal? While traditional investments hinge on long-term trends, event-based trading lets users cash in on predictions in real-time, giving them a front-row seat to high-stakes, headline-driven market moves.

**Trump Odds Surge, Betting Markets Get Serious**

The betting markets were on fire leading up to the election, with millions poured into wagers across various platforms. Kalshi, the only legal site for U.S. election betting, saw over $250 million in wagers, but Polymarket, the grey-market crypto platform, took it to the next level with over $3 billion in bets.

Robinhood even joined the game, rolling out election contracts a week before the final votes were counted. Clearly, everyone‚Äôs trying to cash in on this new political betting boom.

**The Winners, Losers, and Future of Election Betting**

On the winning side? Tesla, Bitcoin, and Trump Media all enjoyed post-election bumps. But this newfound love for political markets has the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) eyeing tougher regulations. They‚Äôre worried that this craze for betting on real-world events could be too risky for the average trader.

So, for now, betting markets are riding high, basking in the glow of their big election night win. Whether they‚Äôll continue this streak without regulation raining on their parade? Only time (and a lot of bets) will tell.

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs lineup starts with initial jobless claims‚Äîaka, the latest pulse check on how many folks are filing for unemployment. It‚Äôs a big deal for the Fed‚Äôs next rate move, though by the time these numbers hit, Jerome Powell and the crew will be locked in on their decision.

So, what‚Äôs the verdict? Analysts are betting hard on a 0.25% rate cut, and markets seem to agree, pricing in the odds of a trim at a cool 99.6%. It‚Äôs a smaller dip than the one in September, but that‚Äôs the Fed keeping things steady. The labor market‚Äôs been flexing some strength lately, so no need for the summer‚Äôs panic-fueled, jumbo-sized cuts.

But don‚Äôt get too hung up on the rate cut itself. Eyes should be on Powell‚Äôs press conference later in the day. The man‚Äôs words and the Fed‚Äôs follow-up chatter could tell us a whole lot more about their game plan for the months ahead.

# Election Day Showdown: Trump vs. Harris And Your Portfolio

It‚Äôs finally Election Day, and after a campaign season that brought us viral squirrels, bear sightings, and unexpected pet memes, we‚Äôre getting back to the real talk: What does this mean for the economy?¬†

Trump and Harris are pitching policies that could shake up your portfolio‚Äîhere‚Äôs a breakdown of their promises, from taxes to trade and everything in between.

**Big Tax Moves**

Both candidates are waving different tax flags. Harris wants to roll the corporate tax rate up to 28%, targeting high earners with a minimum 25% tax on mega-wealth (those with over $100 million) and boosting capital gains for millionaires to 28%.¬†

Trump, on the other hand, aims to lower the corporate rate to 15% for U.S.-based manufacturing and continue the individual and estate tax cuts he pushed in 2017. For big companies, these tax changes could directly affect their bottom lines, impacting market values and shareholder earnings.

**Tariffs & Trade**

Trump's plans are bolder when it comes to tariffs, proposing a 10% across-the-board levy on imports and up to a 200% tariff on Mexican-made cars. The goal? A ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù resurgence, though economists warn this could send prices up across consumer goods.¬†

Harris hasn‚Äôt proposed anything quite as drastic but has hinted she‚Äôd maintain Biden-era tariffs. While Trump‚Äôs approach is all about pushing U.S. manufacturing, Harris‚Äôs steadier stance may appeal to those wary of increased inflation risks.

**What‚Äôs Next for Your Portfolio?**

Analysts suggest a Harris administration could benefit clean energy, healthcare, and homebuilding sectors, while Trump could mean gains for oil, financials, and crypto.¬†

But here‚Äôs the kicker: No matter who wins, staying diversified is key. Historically, the market has weathered administrations of all stripes and come out on top, and experts say focusing on long-term investments over election reactions is a winning strategy.

**The Bottom Line:**¬†Campaign rhetoric is one thing; actual policy is another. Congress has a knack for turning grand ideas into smaller compromises, so while the headlines might sound big, the reality might be more tempered. As we head into a period of potential market jitters, a steady hand and a diversified portfolio might be the most presidential decision you can make.

# Boeing Ends Crippling Strike as Workers Accept Latest Offer

After a 53-day standoff, Boeing‚Äôs machinists are ready to trade picket signs for power tools again. In a nail-biter of a vote, 59% of union members gave the thumbs-up to a new contract that includes a hefty 38% pay bump over four years. '

Boeing‚Äôs production lines can finally get back in gear, which means more jets‚Äîand less red ink.

**A Deal That Soars Higher Than a 737**

This new contract is a big win for Boeing‚Äôs workforce. We‚Äôre talking a 13% instant pay boost, with average salaries climbing to around $119,000 by the end of the deal. Plus, there‚Äôs a $12,000 signing bonus to sweeten the pot.¬†

After years of less-than-stellar raises, machinists have muscled in some major gains‚Äîthough it did take seven weeks of picketing and freezing fingers to make it happen.

**New CEO, New Strategy, and a Costly Pause**

For Boeing‚Äôs new CEO Kelly Ortberg, it‚Äôs been a turbulent start. Since August, he‚Äôs been cutting costs, raising cash, and trying to stay aloft amid production halts and stock hits. The strike alone was draining Boeing of $100 million a day‚Äîsomething the jet giant could hardly afford as shares plummeted over 40% this year.¬†

The settlement is welcome news, but getting production back up to speed won‚Äôt be instant, especially with 737 MAX orders still lagging.

**What‚Äôs Next: Planes, Patience, and Recovery**

Machinists will be back on the factory floor this week, but don‚Äôt expect planes to roll out overnight. Boeing‚Äôs whole supply chain, from fuselage makers to flight-schedule-hungry airlines, took a hit during the strike.

Ramping up production will take time, and Boeing‚Äôs finances are far from stable, with the company still predicting a cash flow drought through 2025.

The bottom line? Boeing may have scored a truce with its workers, but it‚Äôs still got plenty of turbulence to ride out on its journey back to cruising altitude.

# Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs Cash Fortress Tops $300 Billion

Warren Buffett‚Äôs cash stash at Berkshire Hathaway is looking more like a cash fortress, ballooning to a record-breaking $325 billion.¬†

It‚Äôs a fortune even Buffett isn‚Äôt sure how to spend, as he keeps dodging big-ticket buys and instead cashes out on old faves like Apple and Bank of America. Why the hoarding? Some say he‚Äôs just too seasoned to overpay in today‚Äôs market; others think he‚Äôs plotting something big.

Either way, he‚Äôs showing us what real self-control looks like.

**Apple on a Diet, Cash on a Bulk-Up**

Buffett trimmed Berkshire‚Äôs Apple stake by another 25% this quarter, whittling it down to $69.9 billion. Even though the iPhone maker still holds the crown as Berkshire‚Äôs biggest holding, it‚Äôs clear Buffett‚Äôs leaning out the tech exposure.¬†

The kicker? This isn‚Äôt a tech-love breakup, just a careful rebalancing to make sure Apple doesn‚Äôt end up becoming the whole show.

**Buybacks? Not This Time**

Usually, Buffett‚Äôs all about scooping up his own shares when Berkshire‚Äôs cash pile is high, but this quarter, buybacks took a timeout. And that‚Äôs surprising, given Berkshire‚Äôs been on a 25% winning streak this year.¬†

Analysts speculate he‚Äôs holding out for the¬†*really*¬†right moment to jump back in‚Äîbecause why not, when cash is stacking up faster than Wall Street can blink?

**Cash-Burning Dreams:**¬†So, what‚Äôs next for Buffett‚Äôs billions? Will he finally splurge on something big, like a mega-acquisition? Or is he playing the long game, waiting for stock prices to cool off before making any serious moves? One thing‚Äôs clear: the Oracle of Omaha knows patience is a virtue‚Äîand he‚Äôs got the cash mountain to prove it.

# Palantir Reports Record Profit, Cites ‚ÄòUnwavering‚Äô AI Demand

Palantir just dropped a knockout earnings report, sending its stock up 15% after hours. Revenue shot up 30% in Q3 to $725.5 million, leaving analysts' forecasts in the dust. But the real kicker?¬†

Demand for Palantir‚Äôs AI tech in the U.S. is off the charts, setting the company up for a stellar year with a new revenue target of nearly $2.81 billion.

**The U.S. Appetite for AI**

Business is booming stateside, with commercial revenue up 54% and government revenue climbing 40% year-over-year. CEO Alex Karp didn‚Äôt hold back, describing this as ‚Äúunwavering demand‚Äù that‚Äôs positioning Palantir front and center in an AI-powered revolution.

The U.S. government‚Äôs appetite for advanced data tools is a big driver, making Palantir‚Äôs AI solutions essential for organizations seeking smarter, more efficient operations.

**Boosted Guidance Lights Up Investors**

With a solid quarter under its belt, Palantir has raised its guidance, now expecting full-year revenue to land between $2.805 and $2.809 billion‚Äîwell above Wall Street‚Äôs estimates.¬†

Q4‚Äôs forecast looks equally strong, with revenue projected as high as $771 million. Given AI‚Äôs moment in the spotlight, investors are betting on Palantir‚Äôs long-term potential in this high-stakes arena.

**Global Hiccups, U.S. Dominance**

While the U.S. powers Palantir‚Äôs growth, international sales are a mixed bag, particularly in Europe, where commercial revenue slipped this quarter. Yet Karp remains optimistic, seeing the U.S. as the core of Palantir‚Äôs AI growth.¬†

As these tools become integral across industries, Palantir‚Äôs strong domestic foothold could keep it leading the pack, even as it navigates a few global bumps.

# Tomorrow

Two economic reports are due tomorrow‚Äîthe ISM Services Index and a snapshot of the U.S. Trade Deficit. But, let‚Äôs face it, neither will come close to stealing the spotlight from the presidential election.

Election night means noise, lots of it. And with every update and needle movement, it‚Äôs tempting to hit the panic button. But seasoned investors know the real trick: tuning out the chaos and sticking to their strategy.

Here‚Äôs the game plan‚Äîkeep calm, keep steady. The ones who make it big aren‚Äôt the ones glued to every election twist but those who play the long game, staying true to their plan no matter what.

# Super Micro Computer‚Äôs Auditor Ernst & Young resigns¬†

Super Micro‚Äôs rollercoaster ride hit a nosedive as Ernst & Young (EY) resigned as its auditor, citing ‚Äúintegrity concerns‚Äù that raised red flags on the company‚Äôs accounting practices.

EY‚Äôs exit sent the stock tumbling 33%, its worst drop in six years, and now leaves Super Micro scrambling for a new auditor just as the DOJ investigates allegations of revenue inflation from a former employee. For a company that surged with AI-driven demand earlier this year, the timing of these setbacks couldn‚Äôt be worse.

**Trust Issues and Rival Gains**  
  
This isn‚Äôt the first time Super Micro has come under fire for its numbers. Earlier this year, Hindenburg Research spotlighted the company for ‚Äúglaring accounting red flags,‚Äù leading Super Micro to delay its annual financial report while it reassessed internal controls.¬†

Meanwhile, rivals like Dell may seize this moment to gain ground in the lucrative AI server market, where Super Micro has been a major player. As the stock continues to slump, the company‚Äôs competitors are watching closely.

**Delisting Risks Add Pressure**  
  
Super Micro‚Äôs troubles don‚Äôt end with its audit chaos. The company faces a November 16 deadline to regain compliance with Nasdaq rules or risk being delisted, a position it previously found itself in back in 2018.¬†

With time running out to find a new auditor, analysts are sounding alarms about the company‚Äôs future on the exchange. EY‚Äôs exit is a stark reminder of the fragility of market trust, and Super Micro now finds itself on thin ice with both Nasdaq and investors.

**Facing the Climb Back**  
  
Amid the upheaval, Super Micro is sticking to its core business promises, assuring stakeholders that its customer commitments and product roadmap remain on track. Yet, with its stock down over 75% from March highs and sentiment shaky, Super Micro‚Äôs future looks precarious.¬†

For a company that soared on the AI hype, rebuilding credibility with investors will require more than just words‚Äîit‚Äôll need clear, clean financials and an auditor willing to sign on the dotted line.

# Russia Fines Google More Than The World's Entire GDP

Russia just dropped a $20¬†*decillion*¬†fine on Google‚Äîyes, that‚Äôs 20 followed by 33 zeros.¬†

This ‚Äúsymbolic gesture,‚Äù as the Kremlin puts it, demands that Google unblock Russian state-supported media on YouTube, which the tech giant restricted following Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. While the sum is way beyond Google‚Äôs own market value, Moscow‚Äôs message is loud and clear: follow our rules, or face the fines.

**From Courts to Chaos**  
  
Google initially expected any disputes over blocked Russian channels to play out in U.S. or U.K. courts. Instead, Russian media companies have taken the fight global, with cases popping up from South Africa to Turkey.¬†

In one wild twist, South Africa‚Äôs High Court even approved the seizure of some Google assets, part of a broader Russian push to target Western companies ignoring local rulings.

**When Courts Become Weapons**  
  
Legal experts are calling this ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù‚Äîusing courts as geopolitical pawns. Russia‚Äôs recent laws let its courts go after Western companies as payback for sanctions, and as the fines pile up, experts warn this is just the start.¬†

The ongoing fines, doubling weekly, represent a fundamental shift in how international companies are forced to think about geopolitical risk, especially as Russian and Western courts butt heads.

**Just a Symbolic Sting?**  
  
Google, for its part, is playing it cool, saying these legal hurdles won‚Äôt hit the bottom line. Alphabet shares held steady, reflecting Wall Street‚Äôs confidence that these fines won‚Äôt put a dent in the company‚Äôs trillion-dollar valuation.¬†

For now, Google is calling Russia‚Äôs bluff‚Äîbut with fines stacking up, it‚Äôs clear the stakes are high if this legal storm doesn‚Äôt blow over.

"PLEASE HELP - advice needed desperately Hi Everyone!

I've been trading for the last 5 years, and ofc I blew 2 accounts. They weren't big, approximately I blew 2500 USD. Mostly it was occasionally. I would study graphs and indicators; I saw that as developing trading intuition, and it seems to me that I managed to do it. I started day trading again in August, with 100 USD starting capital and for now it's quite successful. Here is my PnL:

[From August 9th till today.](https://preview.redd.it/glumwyhv72yd1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=666100a168b78b6e885289d7c54b6f84b61aa166)

Most of the losing days are the days I don't trade it's just the funding fee for the positions held open for days. Usually, I have 1-3 losing days as you can see below, in the analysis for September. 

https://preview.redd.it/bg8f3e3s82yd1.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ef250adbdb0bf40dea1794a0c90c699e02dd0a

Trading crypto futures on Binance, more specifically: Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Neiro. I do use leverage, often quite high, but my positions are small, and mostly long, so I can't get liquidated. 

I use RSI, moving averages, volume, and support/resistance lines. My preference is trading within a range, I'm not searching for breakouts. Mostly my trades are closed within 2 hours, but some of them I keep for days. I prefer scalping, and that's something I like doing, although it requires a lot of my time to be successful. In the end, it's just a mix of all possible strategies. Trade started with the idea of scalping, but then the opportunity to let it run occurs, and I just let it be.

Gold trading and forex are something I would also like to start doing but I'm not sure if it would be too much. So should I start doing that too? Do you have any suggestions where and how to start? I'm from Europe, more specifically European Union.

I like trading and would like to have a career in it.  Got a finance masters degree, have some experience in financial controlling, and entrepreneurship (agriculture and marketing), but would also like to become a financial analyst (I'm proficient with Excel, financial planning and analysis, DCF, and stock analysis).  Had two interviews for the mentioned position but they picked other candidates because they had more experience and were willing to work for less money.

Another thing I would also like to do is stock valuations. I recently did Tesla and BYD valuation for my master's thesis. People (mostly uni professors) told me I am great at it and should pursue a career in that field. Are there any pages where I can post my valuations and analysis?

As you can see I have a lot of fields of interest hahaha

To put my main interests (and I have many more) in the same place: 

\-crypto, 

\-gold and silver, 

\-euro and dollar, 

\-car manufacturer industry,

\-researching financial frauds, 

\-construction industry, 

\-and agriculture (I'm currently in beekeeping and honey business)

All of my friends have specific interests and jobs, and it just makes me kinda depressed that I would like to do a lot of different things. 

Can you guys give me some advice on what should I do? Should I stick to trading? Valuation? Entrepreneurship? 

Should I stick to crypto trading or try other things too?

Maybe I posted this in the wrong subreddit, but it just seems to me there are a lot of similar people in trading, correct me if I'm wrong. 

Any advice is good, as long as I get them. (Crucify me, just don't turn the cross upside down hahaha)",10-31-2024
"28/10 - PREMARKET REPORT - All the major market moving news  from hours of premarket reading all condensed into one 5 minute read. **MACRO DATA:**

* China industrial profits numbers come in at -3.5% vs 0.3% expected. Hence weak China industrial profit numbers.¬†
* Treasury auctions today for 6 month, 3 month, 2 year and 5 year.¬†
* With bonds a key focus at the moment in the market, being elevated, these treasury auctions are going to be that much more important.¬†

**MARKETS AND FX:**

* Japan‚Äôs Ruling LDP loses majority - uncertainty in parliament and markets.¬†
* Fell short of the 233 seat majority, only secured 215 seats. This means SHigeru Ishiba has to find new allies within 30 days to keep power. **The Bank of Japan‚Äôs rate path may face added complications with a weaker government. So less rate hikes.**
* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this.¬†
* Oil down as ISrael attack on Iran didnt target any oil facilities but instead focused on military bases. This reduces supply disruption which removes a tailwind for oil. Iran also downplayed the attack saying they do not want war. Traders had been bullish on oil on fri, v strong flow, but now IV crush lower. Traders caught out. nearing next support zone at 65.5-67
* SPX: Slightly higher, trading above the 5835 key level.¬†
* Nasdaq: Bounced off of 20,500 level in premarket. Most major big tech names higher.¬†
* Dow Jones: After sell off over last week, is just trying to recover the breakout at 42,300.¬†

* GER40: gapped up but pared all the gains now flat on the day.¬†
* VIX: maintaining at 19.24.
* bond yields elevated. I will be hoping to see bond yields cool off as a result of plunging oil prices. Higher bond yields are a headwind to teh amrket as they attract invstor capital away from equities. We want to see bond yields fall asap, which should happen if we look at historical data on rising bond yields following the first rate cut.

**MAG 7:**

* TSLA - Bernstein gives another underperform rating, price target at 120. I think Bernstein can basically be ignored at this point. They are Tesla perma bulls and it‚Äôs just getting boring at this point. Said that margin strength in last quarter was driven by one off deferred revenue recognitions and commodity contract renewals. Said 20-30% unit growth as Tesla suggested is unlikely.
* TSLA - Price target raised to 298 from 278 at Canaccord, who maintain their buy rating.¬†
* TSLA - price target raised to 285 from 225 at Daiwa. Maintained at Buy.¬†
* These are more respectable price targets although I think Canaccord are closer to the mark.¬†
* TSLA.- extends its 5 year 0% interest loan offer in China until November 30th - increasing incentives on China demand. Applies to rear wheel drive and long range versions.¬†
* MST ahead of earnings, Truist mark as a buy, says they are set to outperform across key enterprise categories. Price target 600.¬†
* AAPL - JPM say that in their tracker of Apple product availability (as a proxy of demand), they see that lead times are more or less in line with iPhone 15, hence demand resilient.¬†

OTHER COMPANIES:

* Volkswagen is planning to cut costs, considering a 10% wage bill reduction and 2 year wage freeze. Also potential to cap bonuses for top employees
* TSM has suspended shipments to chinese chipmaker Sophgo after the TSM chips were found on Huawei‚Äôs Ascend. They say that Sophgo illegally redistributed TSM chips.
* Bigger news, TSM founder says the firm can still see most severe challenges from US restrictions.¬†
* MCD - ahead of earnings tomorrow, they announce they are bringing back quarter pounders next week after e coli outbreak is contained. Said that the contaminated products are no longer in their supply chain.¬†
* Boeing is planing a $15B+ capital raise in order to avoid junk credit rating. They will raise this through. Mix of equity dn convertible debt. Wants to boost liquidity and keep investment grade status.¬†

* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this.¬†
* BOJ will be on this week, expectation is for holding.¬†
* UK BUDGET WILL BE ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK. EXPECTATION IS FOR HIGHER BORROWING, TAX HIKES AND HIGHER SPENDING. Likely will see net growth positive budget, so more likely for cautious BoE cuts.¬†
* Big tech earnings this week - generally, major desks are optimistic going into the week.¬† JPM says the fact that any earnings question marks are being overlooked entirely with NFLX, NOW and VRT, bodes well for Mega cap earnings this week.¬†
* Apple in my opinion the one most likely to disappoint.¬†
* China announces a new outright open market reverse repo tool, targeting primary dealers.¬†
* Note that in truth this is useless. China here want to look like they are doing QE without actually doing QE it seems. I can‚Äôt imagine this measure will have any notable impact on the Chinese economy, which explains why the Hong Kong market is trading entirely flat.¬†

"Brokerage research reports on Tesla (TSLA)?Hey there,



I'm on the hunt for some brokerage research reports on Tesla (TSLA) to get a better grasp of the company's financials and industry trends. I'm looking for the actual PDFs that the brokers publish, but I'm kinda new to this and not sure where the best places are to find these reports.



I'm especially keen on getting detailed analysis, financial projections, and any insights into the EV market that these reports might have.



Any recommendations on where to find these research reports would be awesome! I'd love to hear your favorite spots for digging up this kind of info.

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple‚Äôs reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card.¬†

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren‚Äôt properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation.¬†

On top of that, Apple‚Äôs checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman‚Äôs Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn‚Äôt escape the CFPB‚Äôs scrutiny either.¬†

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren‚Äôt acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards.¬†

The situation was worsened by Goldman‚Äôs failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping‚Äîand they didn‚Äôt hold back.¬†

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO‚Äôs portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor‚Äôs ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn‚Äôt just about grabbing new leagues. TKO‚Äôs getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million.¬†

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they‚Äôre serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO‚Äôs shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO‚Äôs stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What‚Äôs Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO‚Äôs President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup.¬†

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues‚Äîthey‚Äôre stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though‚Äîat least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO‚Äôs not looking to buy more assets from its parent company.¬†

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

Durable goods‚Äîthink cars, washing machines, and industrial robots (maybe) ‚Äîare the heavy hitters of the manufacturing world.

Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt \_\_\_ on the watchlist?‚Äù or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I‚Äôm still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

# Tesla Notches a Blowout Quarter on Strong Sales, Credits

Tesla is back in the fast lane.¬†

The EV giant reported third-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations, clocking in at 72 cents per share and ending a four-quarter losing streak.¬†

Demand for Tesla‚Äôs cars rebounded in a big way, with CEO Elon Musk forecasting a potential 20-30% growth in deliveries next year. Shares surged 12% in late trading, marking a sharp turnaround for the stock, which had been down 14% this year.

Tesla‚Äôs quarterly win wasn‚Äôt just about sales, though. The company raked in $739 million from regulatory credits‚Äîselling them to carmakers who need help meeting emissions targets. It‚Äôs clear that Tesla‚Äôs profits are being boosted not only by the cars on the road but also by the deals happening behind the scenes.

**Driving Growth with New Models and Margins**  
Musk‚Äôs big plans don‚Äôt stop there. Tesla reiterated its commitment to rolling out more affordable models by 2025, while its futuristic Cybertruck is finally profitable after a production ramp-up. And there‚Äôs more good news: Tesla‚Äôs gross margin (excluding credits) jumped to 17.1% from 14.6% last quarter.

The company is also steering full throttle into autonomous driving. Musk teased a robotaxi service, set to launch in Texas and California next year. If the tech holds up (and regulators play ball), this could be a game-changer for Tesla‚Äôs future business model.

**What‚Äôs Next?**  
While Tesla‚Äôs recent results are impressive, challenges lie ahead. T

he company faces stiff competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, along with legacy brands such as Ford and GM stepping up their EV game. Tesla also needs a strong Q4 to top last year‚Äôs deliveries, and heavy price cuts could keep pressuring its margins.

Still, with its sights set on affordable models and a driverless future, Tesla seems ready to ride out the storm. Investors are watching closely to see if this momentum can carry the stock even higher.

# Arm to Scrap Qualcomm Chip Design License, Feud Escalates

Arm just threw a major curveball at Qualcomm.¬†

The UK-based chip designer is pulling the plug on a key license agreement, giving Qualcomm 60 days to fix their messy legal spat or risk losing access to critical tech.¬†

Qualcomm, known for powering most Android smartphones, might be forced to stop selling its flagship processors if it can‚Äôt resolve the issue.

This isn‚Äôt just a minor tiff‚Äîboth companies took a hit. Arm‚Äôs shares dropped 6.67%, and Qualcomm‚Äôs fell 3.8% as the markets weighed the potential fallout of this escalating feud. If the license gets scrapped, Qualcomm‚Äôs $39 billion chip business could be on the chopping block.

**Why the Beef?**  
The bad blood dates back to 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm for breach of contract over its acquisition of Nuvia, a chip-design startup.¬†

Qualcomm says the lawsuit is just Arm trying to strong-arm (pun intended) them into paying higher royalties. Now, Arm‚Äôs stepping things up by threatening to cancel Qualcomm‚Äôs rights to use its chip architecture.

Qualcomm has big plans for Nuvia‚Äôs tech‚Äîits AI-driven PC processors are already hitting the market. If Arm‚Äôs move sticks, Qualcomm may need to scrap Nuvia‚Äôs designs entirely, a costly setback that could give competitors a golden opportunity.

**What‚Äôs Next?**  
With a December trial looming, many see Arm‚Äôs license termination as a bargaining chip to gain leverage.¬†

Qualcomm, however, is no stranger to courtroom drama, having settled disputes with Apple and Nokia in the past. A settlement seems likely, but if not, both companies could face serious damage.

# IMF Lowers Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Increasing Risks

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)‚Äîaka the global economy‚Äôs watchdog‚Äîis sounding the alarm on next year‚Äôs growth prospects.¬†

The IMF, which keeps tabs on the financial health of its 190 member countries, has cut its global growth forecast to 3.2% for 2025, slightly down from its July estimate.¬†

On the bright side, inflation is cooling, expected to fall to 4.3% from 5.8%. Central banks have managed to tame rising prices without triggering recessions.¬†So, cheers to that...sort of.

**Geopolitics: The Wild Card**  
IMF‚Äôs Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it: the risks are piling up. With regional conflicts flaring and protectionism on the rise, global markets could take a hit‚Äîespecially in commodities.¬†

And let‚Äôs not forget global debt, which is on track to hit a jaw-dropping $100 trillion by year-end, mostly thanks to big spenders like the US and China. T

he IMF says governments need to tighten their belts, but with pressures to fund climate initiatives and aging populations, that‚Äôs easier said than done.

**Eurozone Struggles, China Slows**  
The IMF downgraded the Eurozone‚Äôs outlook to 1.2%, mostly due to sluggish manufacturing in Germany and Italy. China didn‚Äôt fare much better‚Äîits growth forecast was slashed too, largely thanks to a shaky real estate market and low consumer confidence.¬†

Though China‚Äôs central bank rolled out some new measures, the IMF isn‚Äôt convinced they‚Äôll do enough to turn the tide. On the flip side, the US is winning the growth race with an upgraded forecast of 2.8%, riding high on strong consumer spending.

**Inflation‚Äôs Almost Beat, But...**  
Even with inflation cooling, the global economy isn‚Äôt exactly cruising. Rising market volatility, geopolitical uncertainties, and the potential for more aggressive monetary policy loom large.¬†

The IMF gave central banks a pat on the back for avoiding a recession, but the road ahead is still filled with potholes. Emerging markets, in particular, are bracing for more turbulence as debt pressures mount.

In short: inflation might be on the retreat, but don't pop the champagne just yet. The IMF‚Äôs forecast is a reality check that the global economy still has a lot of risks to dodge.

# McDonald‚Äôs Quarter Pounder Tied to E. Coli Outbreak

McDonald‚Äôs Quarter Pounder has found itself in hot water after being linked to an E. coli outbreak, which has sickened 49 people across 10 states, leaving one person in Colorado dead.¬†

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flagged slivered onions used in the burger as the likely culprit. McDonald‚Äôs wasted no time, pulling the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in the affected states to contain the outbreak. Talk about a PR nightmare.

**Onion Tears and Bigger Worries**  
It‚Äôs not just the onions making people cry. E. coli O157, the strain in question, can cause some nasty symptoms‚Äîthink severe stomach cramps, and vomiting. Ten people have already been hospitalized, and a child developed a rare complication that can lead to kidney failure.¬†

The CDC is still investigating whether the beef patties or onions are the real issue, but McDonald's is already yanking both from its menu in certain states. Safety first, right?

**D√©j√† Vu for Fast Food?**  
If this sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because Chipotle dealt with a similar E. coli disaster in 2015 that tanked sales and kept customers away for years. McDonald‚Äôs is hoping to avoid that fate by taking ‚Äúswift and decisive action,‚Äù according to Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald‚Äôs USA.¬†

He reassured customers that the Big Mac and other menu staples are still safe to chow down on‚Äîbut for now, the Quarter Pounder is a no-go in several states, including Colorado, Kansas, and Utah.

**The Fallout**  
This outbreak couldn‚Äôt come at a worse time for McDonald‚Äôs, whose US business has already been struggling with inflation-weary customers and slowing sales.¬†

The company‚Äôs shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading as news of the outbreak spread. McDonald‚Äôs has built a reputation on its robust food safety practices, but as history has shown with other chains, foodborne illness outbreaks can be hard to shake off.¬†

McDonald‚Äôs better hope this stays a small fry problem, or it could have a serious mess on its hands.

# Goldman Forecasts Just A 3% S&P 500 Annual Return The Next 10 years

Remember those sweet 13% annual returns from the S&P 500?¬†

Well, giddy up because Goldman Sachs is here to rain on the parade. According to their latest forecast, U.S. stocks will deliver a measly 3% annualized return over the next decade. That‚Äôs a far cry from the gains of the past ten years, where tech giants like Nvidia and Apple led the charge.

Goldman‚Äôs David Kostin and his team crunched the numbers and blamed sky-high valuations and an overly concentrated market.¬†

Right now, a small handful of mega-cap stocks hold the market together, but history shows it‚Äôs tough for companies to keep that kind of momentum going. In short, expect a major slowdown.

**Bonds, Small Caps, and Equal Weight ‚Äì Oh My!**  
So where‚Äôs the opportunity? Goldman suggests that bonds might actually outshine stocks in the next ten years‚Äîgiving them a 72% chance to outperform. The equal-weight S&P 500 is another hot tip, since it spreads the love to smaller players, unlike the current market-weighted index that‚Äôs all about the big boys.¬†

Speaking of smaller players, small-cap stocks might be worth a look too‚Äîthey tend to do well when the market‚Äôs top-heavy.

**Not Just Goldman‚Äôs Gloom**  
Goldman‚Äôs not the only one predicting a bumpy road ahead. JPMorgan is a bit more optimistic, but still expects returns to be less than stellar, projecting about 6% for the next decade.¬†

Both banks agree on one thing: high inflation and inflated valuations are set to hold stocks back. So, if you‚Äôve been banking on those double-digit gains sticking around, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

In a nutshell, the ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù think the stock market is cooling off, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt find ways to win‚Äîyou just might need to play it a little differently.

# Disney will name Bob Iger‚Äôs replacement in early 2026

Bob Iger‚Äôs retirement saga continues! Disney announced it will name Iger‚Äôs successor in early 2026, pushing the date back once again.¬†

While Iger initially planned to hand over the reins by 2024, it seems like the Mouse House isn‚Äôt ready to let him go just yet. James Gorman, former Morgan Stanley CEO, will step in as board chairman in January, guiding the search for the next CEO.

This extra time gives Disney more runway to evaluate candidates‚Äîboth internal and external. But with Iger‚Äôs direct reports like ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro and Disney Experiences‚Äô Josh D‚ÄôAmaro already in the mix, the board has its hands full figuring out who gets to lead one of the world‚Äôs biggest entertainment companies.

**Enter Gorman: The Succession Whisperer**  
Disney‚Äôs had a rocky road when it comes to CEO handoffs (remember the Bob Chapek debacle?).¬†

Now, with Gorman steering the board‚Äôs succession planning, investors are hoping for a smoother ride. Gorman‚Äôs experience in pulling off a seamless CEO transition at Morgan Stanley has earned him serious cred, and Disney is banking on that magic to avoid another leadership disaster.

Gorman takes over from Nike Executive Chairman Mark Parker, who‚Äôs stepping down after a nine-year stint on the board. Some are saying Gorman‚Äôs outsider perspective might finally bring the fresh, independent leadership Disney‚Äôs board needs after being so closely tied to Iger for years.

**Who‚Äôs Next in Line?**  
Four big names are in the running for Disney‚Äôs top job, and they‚Äôve all had their turn in the hot seat. Josh D‚ÄôAmaro, who oversees Disney‚Äôs theme parks and cruise lines, is one of the favorites.¬†

He‚Äôs got a solid public profile and is leading the company‚Äôs $60 billion park expansion. Meanwhile, Dana Walden has made waves in TV and streaming, but her limited experience in other divisions could hold her back.

Then there‚Äôs Jimmy Pitaro, ESPN‚Äôs sports king, and Alan Bergman, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, who‚Äôs deeply embedded in Hollywood. Of course, there‚Äôs always a wildcard‚Äîan outside candidate waiting to swoop in.¬†

For now, Disney has plenty of time to decide, but whoever lands the role will have some massive shoes to fill.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs one of those unicorn days in the economic world‚Äîno big announcements in sight. So take a breather and turn your attention to the real action: earnings season.

# Before Market Open:

* **General Motors**¬†is cruising through a sales slump like many other automakers, but its stock has stayed in the fast lane this year. Higher profits, tighter cost controls, and a robust dividend and buyback program have kept investors happy. Now, shareholders are eager to hear how GM plans to keep the good times rolling, boost sales, and (fingers crossed) turn a profit in its EV division. The consensus? $2.43 EPS on $44.8 billion in revenue. ($GM)¬†",10-22-2024
"Stock Market Today: Uber Explores Acquiring Expedia + Tesla Faces Investigation Of ‚ÄòFull Self-Driving‚Äô After Fatal Collision* The S&P 500 climbed 0.40%, the Dow edged up 0.09%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.63% on Friday, marking six consecutive weeks of gains for all three indexes. Netflix‚Äôs stronger-than-expected earnings played a big part in boosting the Nasdaq's performance.
* Despite the stock market's strong showing, rising Treasury yields threw a wrench in hopes for quick rate cuts. Solid retail sales data fueled concerns that the Fed might not ease rates as soon as traders anticipated, but stocks still managed to reach new highs as attention shifts to more Big Tech earnings on the horizon.

# 

# Winners & Losers

# What‚Äôs up¬†üìà

* **Netflix**¬†jumped 10.09% after reporting third-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations. The company earned $5.40 per share on $9.83 billion in revenue, surpassing the expected $5.12 per share and $9.77 billion. Analysts praised the results and raised price targets, anticipating further growth. ($NFLX)
* **Lamb Weston**¬†rose 10.17% after activist investor Jana Partners urged the company to explore a potential sale, which excited shareholders. ($LW)
* **Intuitive Surgical**¬†climbed 10.01% to a new all-time high, driven by strong earnings fueled by sales of its da Vinci surgical device. ($ISRG)
* **Apple**¬†is up 1.23% on reports from Bloomberg indicating shockingly strong iPhone 16 demand in China. ($AAPL)
* **Spotify**¬†climbed 3.31%. ($SPOT)
* **Reddit**¬†jumped 6.04%. ($RDDT)

# What‚Äôs down¬†üìâ

* **CVS Health**¬†fell 5.23% after news broke that CEO Karen Lynch will be replaced by David Joyner following three years at the helm. Joyner has been leading the company‚Äôs pharmacy service business for the past two years. ($CVS)
* **WD-40**¬†dropped 4.79% after missing both revenue and earnings estimates in the last quarter, disappointing investors. ($WDFC)
* **American Express**¬†dropped 3.15% after reporting third-quarter revenue of $16.64 billion, slightly below the $16.67 billion consensus forecast. However, earnings per share exceeded expectations, coming in at $3.49 versus the anticipated $3.28. ($AXP)
* **Vertex Pharmaceuticals**¬†fell 3.15%. ($VRTX)

# Uber Explores Acquiring Expedia

Uber is revving up for a possible detour into the travel industry.¬†

Reports suggest the ride-hailing giant has kicked the tires on acquiring Expedia, though no formal offer is on the table. The deal would be a major play for Uber as it aims to become a ‚Äúsuper app,‚Äù offering everything from rides to takeout to now, potentially, your next vacation.¬†

It‚Äôs no secret that CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has his roots in Expedia, having run the company before moving to Uber‚Äîso a reunion could be on the horizon.

**High Risk, High Reward?**¬†But as intriguing as it sounds, this deal isn‚Äôt without its potholes. Uber‚Äôs stock took a 3% hit after the news broke, while Expedia‚Äôs shares saw a 5% lift. Investors seem torn.¬†

While acquiring Expedia would let Uber gobble up a major slice of the travel pie, it‚Äôs a massive undertaking that could distract the company from its core business‚Äîespecially with autonomous vehicles looming on the horizon.

**The Expedia Factor:**¬†For Expedia, teaming up with Uber could offer a much-needed boost. The travel giant has faced stiff competition from rivals like Booking and Airbnb, and an Uber-sized partnership might help it recover market share.¬†

With the travel industry still in a post-pandemic shuffle, aligning with a booming tech company could give Expedia the edge it needs.

**Super App Ambitions ‚Äî**¬†Still, for Uber, this could be the big leap toward becoming a one-stop shop for all things life-related. Imagine booking a flight, a hotel, and an Uber ride to the airport all in one app. The idea has its appeal, but analysts are cautious, suggesting partnerships might be a safer bet.¬†

After all, integrating Expedia‚Äôs vast network of services could be like trying to merge two freeway systems‚Äîcomplicated and filled with potential roadblocks.

# Market Movements

* **üè•¬†CVS names new CEO:**¬†CVS Health has¬†appointed David Joyner as CEO, replacing Karen Lynch¬†amid financial struggles. Its stock price has dropped 19% YTD, and Q3 earnings are expected to miss expectations. ($CVS)

# Tesla Faces Investigation Of ‚ÄòFull Self-Driving‚Äô After Fatal Collision

Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) system just found itself under the federal microscope.¬†

After a fatal pedestrian crash involving a Tesla Model Y, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened an investigation into whether Tesla‚Äôs FSD can handle tricky visibility situations like fog and sun glare. With four similar crashes on record, things aren't exactly cruising for Tesla‚Äôs autonomous ambitions.

**Fog, Glare, and Red Flags:**¬†This isn‚Äôt Tesla‚Äôs first run-in with regulators. The NHTSA is already digging into Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot system, which has its own laundry list of incidents.¬†

Now, FSD‚Äîdesigned to eventually make driving hands-free‚Äîfaces questions about whether it's safe for real-world use, especially when the weather doesn‚Äôt play nice. Oh, and by the way, 2.4 million Tesla vehicles are now under the investigation spotlight.

**Investors Tap the Brakes:**¬†Tesla's stock took a slight dip after the news broke, and it‚Äôs not hard to see why. Just last week, Elon Musk hyped up plans for driverless robotaxis, but the lack of juicy details left investors unimpressed.¬†

Now, with this probe looming over FSD, Tesla's road to fully autonomous vehicles could hit more than a few potholes.

**A Bumpy Ride Ahead?**¬†Musk has been promising true driverless tech for years, but reality keeps hitting back. With regulators now sniffing around, Tesla‚Äôs timeline for unsupervised FSD looks a lot fuzzier.¬†

The big question: can Tesla steer through this storm, or will it find itself stalled at the side of the road?

# üé∂¬†Starships Were¬†Meant¬†To¬†Fly¬†Be Caught

SpaceX just pulled off a literal grab for the history books. During Sunday‚Äôs Starship test, the Super Heavy booster returned to Earth and was¬†*caught*¬†by giant ""chopstick"" arms attached to the launch tower.¬†

This first-of-its-kind move is another step toward making space travel more reusable and cost-effective, a goal that Elon Musk has been chasing like a kid after ice cream on a hot day.

It was a picture-perfect flight: The Super Heavy booster detached from Starship at an altitude of about 40 miles, did a U-turn, and headed back to the launchpad. Instead of landing on legs, like SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rockets, it steered into the waiting arms of the chopsticks. Cue the cheers at mission control.

**Why It Matters**  
Reusability has always been SpaceX‚Äôs secret sauce. Traditional rockets? One and done. But Musk has been adamant that rockets should be like airplanes‚Äîyou don‚Äôt throw them away after one trip. By catching the booster, SpaceX moves closer to making rapid, low-cost space launches a reality.¬†

This isn‚Äôt just about saving money‚Äîit‚Äôs a crucial step toward launching multiple missions in a single day.

This booster recovery milestone is also a win for NASA, which is banking on Starship to land humans on the Moon by 2026 as part of its Artemis mission. With Sunday‚Äôs success, SpaceX is proving that its reusable rocket tech isn‚Äôt just sci-fi fantasy anymore‚Äîit‚Äôs happening.

**Eyes on Mars**  
But don‚Äôt think Musk is stopping at the Moon. His ultimate goal? Sending humans to Mars. SpaceX has its sights set on launching five uncrewed Starship missions to the red planet in the next two years. Each test, like Sunday‚Äôs catch, brings Musk closer to making that dream a reality.¬†

So, while the Super Heavy booster‚Äôs flawless return is impressive, it‚Äôs just the beginning of SpaceX‚Äôs larger cosmic ambitions.

# Earning‚Äôs Season Is Here

Earnings season is upon us, and after a $9 trillion rally, 2024‚Äôs bullish run faces a reality check. Analysts are calling for just a 4.3% profit bump for the S&P 500 this quarter‚Äîthe weakest growth we‚Äôve seen in a year. Expectations have been on a diet, too: Back in June, experts were predicting a solid 8.4% rise.¬†

But don't lose hope just yet‚Äîthis is Wall Street, where surprises lurk around every corner. Remember the first quarter when projections were bleak but profits soared 7.9%?

Despite the low bar, the S&P 500 has been climbing like it‚Äôs auditioning for an action movie, hitting fresh highs and clocking a 22% gain in 2024 so far. It's the best start since 1997, and some investors are betting this could lead to an earnings surprise, just like earlier this year. The optimists might just have a point.

**The AI Party Slows Down**  
Speaking of action movies, the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants‚ÄîApple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla‚Äîare still the stars of the earnings show. Together, they‚Äôre expected to post an 18% profit rise, but don‚Äôt get too excited: their growth rate is slowing. They were churning out over 30% increases last year, but this quarter, the AI-fueled party is looking a little more low-key.

For the rest of the S&P 500, it‚Äôs a bit of a grind. Profits outside of the tech bubble are set to rise just 1.8%. But hey, a win‚Äôs a win, right? And looking ahead, analysts expect much stronger numbers in early 2025, with double-digit growth on the horizon.

**A Stock Picker‚Äôs Playground**  
Here‚Äôs where things get spicy: this could be a¬†*stock picker‚Äôs*¬†paradise. While overall market volatility is snoozing, individual stocks are gearing up for some wild moves. Bank of America‚Äôs data shows that post-earnings swings could be the biggest since 2021, so if you can spot the winners and losers, you might just walk away with a big payout.¬†

Tech, communication services, and healthcare stocks are expected to shine, while energy stocks may take a hit as crude prices slide.

**Margin Watch and Election Talk**  
As earnings trickle in, one thing everyone will be keeping an eye on is profit margins. The forecast? A slight dip to 12.9% from last quarter‚Äôs 13.1%, as companies face rising input costs. But don‚Äôt sweat it too much‚Äîmargins are expected to rebound soon enough.

Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget about politics. With the U.S. presidential election around the corner, corporate America is getting nervous. Mentions of ""election"" on earnings calls are up 62% from four years ago, and history suggests investment could take a breather until the dust settles.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Earnings season kicks off tomorrow, and it‚Äôs poised to send some ripples through the markets. With big reports from key players set to roll in, investors are gearing up for what could be a pivotal moment. Expect some surprises and volatility as the numbers start to drop‚Äîthis is when things get interesting.

# Before Market Open:

* Warren Buffett seems to be cooling on¬†**Bank of America**¬†($BAC), offloading shares consistently for months. While that‚Äôs hardly a confidence booster, shareholders shouldn‚Äôt panic just yet. Interest rate cuts and AI developments could still bolster the bank‚Äôs long-term outlook. Plus, recent earnings from major banks signal stronger net interest income across the board. Analysts are expecting $0.77 EPS on $25.31 billion in revenue.
* Meanwhile,¬†**Albertsons Companies**¬†($ACI) has left investors anxiously awaiting news on its potential merger with Kroger. The deal has been in the works for two years, but even if it falls through, Albertsons remains a strong player in the grocery space. With same-store sales growth and widening profit margins, the company should continue to hold its own. The consensus? $0.48 EPS and $18.47 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **United Airlines**¬†($UAL) might not seem like a top pick given the turbulence the airline industry has faced lately‚Äîthink major IT outages and struggling competitors. But United has managed to rise above the chaos. If Delta‚Äôs performance is any indication (despite the impact of CrowdStrike‚Äôs toll on the sector), United is likely to stay on course. Analysts remain optimistic. The consensus? $3.07 EPS and $14.78 billion in revenue.",10-14-2024

* **Fastenal**¬†($FAST) climbed 9.76% after the construction and hardware equipment manufacturer delivered stronger-than-expected revenue, exceeding analysts' forecasts for the last quarter.

# JPMorgan Chase & Wells Fargo Earnings

JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) kicked off the earnings season with a surprise: net interest income (NII) rose 3%, beating expectations. The bank raised its full-year NII forecast to $92.5 billion, signaling resilience even as analysts predicted a rate-cut-driven decline. Investment banking also saw a 31% surge, well above the 16% expected.

But Jamie Dimon didn‚Äôt let the good news linger‚Äîhe quickly shifted focus to the darker side, warning that geopolitics are ‚Äútreacherous and getting worse.‚Äù

**Wells Fargo Joins the Earnings Party**  
Not to be outdone, Wells Fargo ($WFC) also posted stronger-than-expected results, buoyed by a 37% leap in investment-banking fees. While the bank‚Äôs net income slipped 11% due to higher deposit costs, it still beat analyst expectations, driving a 5% stock jump. CEO Charlie Scharf has been aggressively expanding the bank‚Äôs investment banking arm, and it seems to be paying off‚Äîat least for now.

**Credit Concerns Lurk:**¬†Despite the strong quarter, JPMorgan‚Äôs credit-card unit raised some red flags. Loan losses hit $3.11 billion, mostly tied to consumer credit cards, as the bank braces for higher defaults.¬†

Dimon didn‚Äôt sugarcoat it: 2025 NII will likely come in lower, and deposit balances have started to shrink. Wells Fargo echoed similar concerns, noting that lower-income customers are feeling more financial pressure, which could weigh on future lending profits.

**Looking Ahead, Caution Reigns:**¬†Both banks‚Äô strong Q3 showings offered a glimmer of optimism, but there‚Äôs still plenty of caution in the air. Dimon‚Äôs warnings about geopolitical risks and fiscal challenges loom large, while Wells Fargo is preparing for continued pressure on net interest income.¬†

The takeaway? Banks are navigating the current environment well, but the road ahead may be bumpier than these earnings suggest.

# Tesla Shares Sink After Musk‚Äôs Robotaxi Unveiling Disappoints

Tesla's long-awaited robotaxi debut didn‚Äôt exactly electrify investors. At a highly anticipated event, Elon Musk showed off the Cybercab, a futuristic two-seater, and the Robovan, capable of transporting 20 passengers. But beyond the sleek designs, the presentation was light on the critical details‚Äîlike how Tesla plans to leap from driver-assistance technology to full autonomy.¬†

As a result, Tesla's stock took a hit, sliding 8.8% and wiping out $67 billion in market value.

**All Hype, No Timelines**  
Musk dangled the prospect of a $30,000 Cybercab hitting production by 2026, but investors have heard lofty promises before. Remember when a million robotaxis were supposed to be on the road by 2020?¬†

Fast forward to today, and we still haven‚Äôt seen a single one. The event glossed over key details like regulatory hurdles, safety protocols, or whether Tesla would run its own fleet. Analysts were left wanting more, with many calling the reveal more sizzle than steak.

**Uber and Lyft Take a Victory Lap:**¬†Tesla‚Äôs stumble became a win for competitors Uber and Lyft, whose stocks soared by about 10%. With no real timeline for fully autonomous cars from Tesla, ride-hailing companies seem to have dodged a bullet‚Äîat least for now.¬†

Investors looking for concrete steps toward a self-driving future were left scratching their heads, as Tesla‚Äôs track record of missing deadlines looms large.

**Bold Vision, Bigger Questions**  
Musk painted a utopian future of robotaxis erasing parking lots and traffic jams, but the path to get there is anything but clear. Investors are skeptical about Tesla‚Äôs ability to overcome regulatory roadblocks, liability issues, and technical challenges. With no functional demo or detailed roadmap, the robotaxi remains a concept rather than a reality.¬†

For now, Tesla‚Äôs bold vision of a driverless future is still more dream than execution.

# Next Week

Monday is a federal holiday, which means the bond market is taking the day off. The stock market? Still open, but don't expect any fireworks‚Äîmost investors are clocking out for a long weekend, so no big earnings or economic reports are on deck.

This week is pretty much a snooze fest for economic data. Tuesday and Wednesday won‚Äôt move the needle much, but Thursday is where things get interesting with initial jobless claims, US retail sales, and the Home Builder Confidence Index. By Friday, we'll be diving into more housing numbers with housing starts and building permits.

"How to find upcoming stock events?Hi everyone,

This may seem like a stupid question but does anyone know any good sources to find upcoming events for a company? I'm an options trader and took a credit spread trade on Tesla and uber this week. All was going well until Tesla announced the CyberCab at their auto show event and the stock tanked 10% overnight - totally ruining my spread. As a result investors shifted their money to competitors like Uber and that jumped 8% over night - also destroying my play there.

My problem is that I did not know about this auto show and was not able to find out about it until after it happened. I took these trades because I initially thought there wasn't much going on this week and the stocks would most likely trade sideways. I don't mind taking risks just as long as I know what the risks are, but I got blindsided by this one. 

My question is, how do you find out about upcoming events like this? Are there any good resources you guys use to stay up-to-date? I want to make sure I know all the variables next time I take a trade.

Thanks",10-11-2024

# Tesla‚Äôs Robotaxi Day Is Upon Us After A Decade Of Promises

Elon Musk, never one to shy away from grand promises, is gearing up for Tesla‚Äôs biggest reveal since the Model 3.¬†Tonight at¬†7 p.m. Pacific¬†(10 p.m. Eastern),¬†the long-awaited robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, will make its debut at Warner Bros. studios.¬†For those tuning in, the event will be livestreamed on Musk‚Äôs¬†X platform¬†(formerly known as Twitter).

For Musk, this is more than just a new car‚Äîit‚Äôs a pivot toward AI and robotics that he believes could propel Tesla‚Äôs value to $30 trillion (yes, trillion). But as history has shown, Musk‚Äôs lofty ambitions often come with missed deadlines, so investors are cautiously optimistic.

**Can Tesla Go Driverless?**  
The hype is real, and Tesla‚Äôs stock has surged 52% since the event was announced. But skeptics are quick to remind everyone that Musk has been teasing the robotaxi concept since 2016, with little to show for it. While Waymo already has driverless cars cruising around cities like San Francisco and Phoenix, Tesla‚Äôs autonomous tech still requires human oversight.¬†

The big question: Can Tesla leapfrog its competitors and actually deliver on the promise of a fully autonomous vehicle?

**All Eyes on the Cybercab**  
Musk has called tonight‚Äôs event ‚Äúone for the history books.‚Äù The Cybercab, expected to be a sleek, two-seater without a steering wheel, could launch Tesla into new territory. However, the road ahead is bumpy.¬†

Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) software still isn‚Äôt fully autonomous, and regulatory hurdles are a massive roadblock. While Waymo is already operational in select cities, Tesla will need to convince regulators and investors that its tech is ready for primetime.

**High Hopes, Big Risks**  
Analysts are split. Bulls see the robotaxi as a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, potentially adding $4 billion in sales by 2030. Skeptics, on the other hand, point to Musk‚Äôs track record of overpromising and under-delivering. If tonight‚Äôs event doesn‚Äôt meet expectations, it could deal a blow to Tesla‚Äôs stock, which is already down nearly 40% from its peak.¬†

But if Musk pulls it off? Tesla might just shift into the next gear, leaving competitors in the dust.

# AMD Launches AI Chip To Rival Nvidia‚Äôs Blackwell

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) has been hot on Nvidia‚Äôs trail, trying to stake its claim in the booming artificial intelligence chip market. On Thursday, AMD revealed its newest AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, at an event in San Francisco. While CEO Lisa Su boasted about the chip's edge over Nvidia‚Äôs H100, investors were left wanting more.¬†

AMD‚Äôs stock slid 4% after the event, its steepest drop in over a month, as key details about customers and financial performance remained elusive.

**The AI Chip Race Heats Up**  
With Nvidia dominating the AI accelerator market, AMD is in catch-up mode. Su claims the MI325X, with its new high-bandwidth memory, offers better AI inference performance.¬†

But here‚Äôs the catch: Nvidia‚Äôs upcoming Blackwell chips, set to ship next year, could leave AMD‚Äôs latest chip in the dust. Investors have been eagerly waiting for AMD to prove it can chip away at Nvidia‚Äôs market share, but Thursday‚Äôs event fell short of the expected breakthrough.

**Growing Market, Fierce Competition**  
AMD is playing the long game, forecasting the AI chip market to hit $500 billion by 2028. While the company is making strides in AI, capturing just 34% of the market for server CPUs, Nvidia remains the top dog with over 90% of the data center AI chip market.¬†

And while AMD‚Äôs AI accelerators have potential, the widespread use of Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA programming language continues to lock developers into the Nvidia ecosystem, making it harder for AMD to gain traction.

**Looking Ahead:**¬†AMD has ambitious plans, unveiling its next-generation MI350 GPU series, set to arrive in 2025 with a whopping 35 times more performance than its predecessors. But by then, Nvidia may have already one-upped AMD with newer, more powerful GPUs.¬†

Investors are keeping a close watch on whether AMD can deliver on its promises and grab a bigger slice of the AI pie, but for now, Nvidia still holds the upper hand.

# The DOJ Wants To Break Up Google‚Äôs Monopoly

Google's monopoly reign might be facing its toughest challenge yet. The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) is weighing a move that could break up the tech titan after a judge ruled it unlawfully dominated search and ad markets.¬†

In a court filing, the DOJ proposed everything from breaking off pieces of Google‚Äôs business (think Chrome and Android) to forcing the company to share its search data with competitors. It‚Äôs a bold step that echoes the antitrust battles of the early 2000s‚Ä¶remember Microsoft?

Not surprisingly, Google isn‚Äôt too thrilled. The company called the DOJ‚Äôs plan ""radical"" and warned that messing with its business model could have unintended consequences, like fewer free services for users. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares slid 1.6% on the news‚Äîcue the market jitters.

**Tech Titans Under the Microscope**  
Google‚Äôs not the only one sweating right now. Almost half of the S&P 500, including big names like Meta, Nvidia, and Amazon, are in antitrust hot water too. Regulators are accusing them of crushing competition and monopolizing key markets.¬†

But, despite these lawsuits, Big Tech‚Äôs still living its best life, with stock prices climbing thanks to AI innovation.

The DOJ‚Äôs real focus? The future of search, especially with AI on the rise. They want to prevent Google from flexing its dominance as AI-powered search tools become the norm. Regulators are thinking long-term here, trying to stop Google from maintaining its stranglehold in the tech space.

**The Long Legal Road Ahead**  
Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled Google was guilty of monopolistic behavior, now has to decide what to do about it. The DOJ‚Äôs suggested remedies range from ‚Äújust change your behavior‚Äù to ‚Äútime to break up the band.‚Äù¬†

While some experts think a breakup is unlikely (at least anytime soon), this legal battle is far from over. Google‚Äôs going to fight, and they‚Äôre likely to appeal any decisions not in their favor.

**The Big Picture:**¬†Despite the legal storm, analysts aren‚Äôt losing sleep over it. Tech stocks have been riding high, with investors more interested in earnings and product launches than courtroom drama. For now, it‚Äôs business as usual, but if the DOJ really manages to pull off a Google breakup? Well, that could be a game-changer.

# WeightWatchers To Offer Compounded GLP-1 Weight-Loss Drugs

WeightWatchers just jumped into the weight-loss drug game with a twist. The company announced it‚Äôll start offering a compounded version of Wegovy (aka a cheaper knockoff) after facing shortages of the real deal.¬†

At $129 for the first month and $189 thereafter, it‚Äôs a far cry from the $1,300 price tag of branded options like Ozempic. Naturally, the stock shot up by nearly 47% on the news.

But the real question is‚Äîhow long can this ride last?

**It‚Äôs Getting Crowded in Here**  
WeightWatchers is showing up a bit late to the knockoff Wegovy party, where companies like Hims & Hers and Noom have been hanging out for months. But what WeightWatchers brings to the table is its bread-and-butter combo of behavioral coaching and clinical support.¬†

So, it‚Äôs not just about the drugs‚Äîit‚Äôs about changing the whole lifestyle.

Still, the FDA is cracking down. They‚Äôve already removed drugs like Mounjaro from the shortage list, which means compounded versions could disappear fast. For now, semaglutide (the magic behind Wegovy and Ozempic) remains in short supply, so WeightWatchers might still have time to carve out its slice of the market.

**WeightWatchers' Identity Crisis**  
This move comes at a shaky time for WeightWatchers. They‚Äôve had a rough year, with their stock losing more than 90% of its value. Plus, CEO Sima Sistani exited stage left just two weeks ago, and Oprah‚Äîyes,¬†*the*¬†Oprah‚Äîditched the board earlier this year after admitting she‚Äôs been on weight-loss meds herself. Yikes.

But interim CEO Tara Comonte is trying to steer the ship by banking on this drug offering, even as the weight-loss world shifts away from the traditional ""dieting"" approach that WeightWatchers has been known for.

**Can They Keep the Momentum?:**¬†The stock surge suggests investors like what they‚Äôre seeing for now, but the weight-loss landscape is getting tougher by the day. With FDA regulations tightening and plenty of competitors already in the game, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how long WeightWatchers can keep riding this wave.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

The weekly initial jobless claims report is here again, and all eyes are on it, especially with the Fed‚Äôs focus on the labor market as it charts the course for future rate cuts.

However, tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report is set to steal the spotlight. CPI tracks the monthly price shifts in goods that Americans buy, making it a crucial measure of inflation. Economists predict a 2.3% annual increase in September‚Äôs CPI, up from August‚Äôs 2.1%, while core CPI, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to hold steady at 3.2%. If these numbers hold, the Fed may feel more confident about proceeding with rate cuts. But any surprises could throw a wrench in those plans, keeping investors on edge.

# Activist Investor Starboard Value Takes $1 Billion Stake in Pfizer

It's the classic tale of a corporate shake-up: missed targets, mounting investor frustration, and then the activists come knocking on your door. Starboard Value, helmed by the ""most feared man in corporate America"" Jeff Smith, has just taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer, seeking to revive the pharmaceutical giant's fortunes.

Pfizer's stock rose 2.12% on the news but remains down 1.83% for 2024‚Äîa stark contrast to the S&P 500's 20% climb this year.

**A Pandemic Peak and a Post-Covid Slump**  
Pfizer's pandemic glory days seem like a distant memory. During the peak, the company became a household name thanks to its record-breaking vaccine rollout. Revenues skyrocketed from $42 billion in 2020 to $100 billion in 2022. But as the world returned to normal, demand for its Covid-19 products took a nosedive.

The problem? Pfizer's other offerings couldn't pick up the slack. Even its much-hyped anti-obesity drug flopped, leaving the pharma giant without a clear path forward.

CEO Albert Bourla went on a spending spree during the pandemic‚Äînearly $70 billion in acquisitions since 2020‚Äîwhile also boosting Pfizer's R&D budget. Despite these efforts, results have been underwhelming.

Just this month, Pfizer had to pull a sickle cell drug it acquired for $5 billion. Another setback in its acquisition-heavy growth strategy.

**Reuniting with the Old Guard**  
Now, Starboard is looking to bring back some familiar faces: ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio. Both have expressed interest in returning to help steady the ship, according to reports.

Under Read's leadership from 2010 to 2018, Pfizer had a more focused approach, zeroing in on core businesses like vaccines and cancer. Starboard seems to hope that a dose of the old guard's discipline can turn things around.

Pfizer has already started reining in spending, with a $4 billion cost-cutting program announced last year. But it hasn't been enough to lift the company out of its post-pandemic slump.

Maybe Starboard's intervention, paired with a reunion of past leaders, can help Pfizer regain its lost momentum‚Äîor at least give the stock a much-needed shot in the arm.

# Google Play Must Allow Rival Android App Stores, Judge Rules

Big news in the tech world: a federal judge has ordered Google to loosen its grip on the Android app market. Starting November, the tech giant must allow rival app stores to compete more freely with Google Play‚Äîa move that could reshape how apps are distributed across Android devices.

The ruling comes after Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, scored a significant victory in its long-standing antitrust battle against Google. The judge concluded that Google abused its power by restricting developers and creating barriers for competing app stores.

Now, for the next three years, Google can't force developers to exclusively use its app store or its billing features. Rival stores will also get a shot at accessing Google's app catalog.

**Antitrust Pressure Mounts**  
The court's decision is the latest blow in Google's ongoing struggle with antitrust authorities. Just this August, the search giant lost another major case over claims that it monopolized online search and advertising markets. The pressure on Google keeps mounting, and it's not just in the U.S.‚Äîregulators worldwide are eyeing similar app store practices.

Judge James Donato, who issued the ruling, made it clear that his aim is to restore fair competition. Google will have to let developers tell customers about alternative ways to download apps, allow rival stores to have access to its platform, and ensure that app developers aren't forced to use Google's billing services.

The injunction lasts until 2027, giving competitors time to establish a meaningful presence in the Android ecosystem.

**Epic Games Is Not Done Yet**  
Epic Games, which has had mixed results in a similar lawsuit against Apple, isn‚Äôt backing down. CEO Tim Sweeney took to social media, announcing that Epic will launch its own app store on Android next year. He sees this ruling as a major opportunity for developers, carriers, and app store makers to create a more competitive Android ecosystem.

Google, for its part, is gearing up to appeal. The company insists its practices benefit users by enhancing security and consistency on Android devices. The judge allowed Google to implement ""reasonable measures"" to ensure platform security, but those measures will be under scrutiny by a committee formed by both Epic and Google.

The battle over app stores is far from over.

But one thing is certain: this ruling opens the door for a lot more competition in the Android world.

# Day Trader Turns $306M into Nothing, Sues for Negligence

Classic day-trader tale: a guy, some cash, and Tesla options. For Vancouver Island carpenter Christopher DeVocht, it turned into one of the wildest rides in day-trading history.

By late 2019, DeVocht‚Äôs trading account with RBC Dominion Securities sat at C$88,000. Fast forward two years‚Äîit ballooned to C$415 million ($306 million). Riding high on Tesla options, DeVocht seemed unstoppable. But instead of cashing out, he doubled down, betting everything on Tesla's continued rise. Then came 2022. Tesla‚Äôs stock took a nosedive, and with it, DeVocht‚Äôs massive fortune disappeared‚Äîfrom $306 million to nothing.

Now, DeVocht is suing RBC and accounting firm Grant Thornton for what he calls ""negligent advice."" He claims the guidance he received‚Äîfocused on minimizing taxes‚Äîdidn‚Äôt account for his limited financial know-how. Instead of taking profits, he was advised to concentrate his holdings in Tesla and get tax breaks by forming an investment holding company, leading to disastrous overexposure.

As Tesla‚Äôs stock plunged, DeVocht borrowed millions from a margin account to stay afloat, hoping to recover his losses. He even borrowed C$20 million for shorter-term trades, but that didn‚Äôt work out either. Eventually, the corporation had to sell all Tesla holdings to repay loans, leaving DeVocht empty-handed.

DeVocht insists that with better advice, he wouldn‚Äôt have lost everything. He claims RBC wrongly treated him as a sophisticated investor, and now he‚Äôs seeking damages for breach of contract and negligence. He‚Äôs also blaming a recommendation to donate C$25.5 million to charity for adding to his financial woes.

Royal Bank hasn‚Äôt commented, and Grant Thornton says they‚Äôre sticking to professional standards‚Äîwhatever that means in this mess. For now, DeVocht‚Äôs story is a cautionary tale of what happens when day traders get in over their heads without a safety net.

# College students used Meta‚Äôs smart glasses to dox people in real time

Picture this: You‚Äôre on the subway, minding your business, and suddenly someone knows your name, job, and where you live‚Äîall thanks to a pair of smart glasses. Sounds like sci-fi? Not anymore. Two Harvard students recently turned Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban glasses into a real-life doxxing device, and it‚Äôs raising major privacy red flags.

AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio used Meta‚Äôs glasses paired with the facial recognition tool PimEyes to scan strangers and gather personal info, like addresses and job details. In their demo, they even used the data to strike up conversations with unsuspecting people. The glasses streamed video to a laptop, where the real magic‚Äîand invasion of privacy‚Äîhappened. Meta was quick to point out that this wasn‚Äôt built-in tech; it was a hack using publicly available tools. But the glasses‚Äô hands-free, inconspicuous design makes this kind of invasion way too easy.

Big picture: Back in 2021, Meta execs‚Äîincluding current CTO Andrew Bosworth‚Äîactually considered adding facial recognition to these glasses, thinking it could help you remember someone‚Äôs name at a party. The idea got scrapped, probably because of the massive ethical and legal issues. But wearable tech is catching on, and attitudes are shifting. Meta has already sold over 700,000 pairs of these glasses in the last year, despite privacy concerns.

What‚Äôs next? Are we on the path to accepting facial recognition in our everyday tech, or is this a step too far? With smart glasses blending into everyday fashion, it‚Äôs getting harder to tell when you‚Äôre being recorded‚Äîand that‚Äôs what makes this debate so urgent.

The potential for misuse is clear. Imagine someone using these glasses not just for fun, but for malicious purposes‚Äîstalking, harassment, or worse. It‚Äôs a fine line between convenience and invasion, and the ease of combining wearable tech with facial recognition makes it all the more dangerous. While some people might welcome the idea of recognizing acquaintances in public, the risks far outweigh the benefits for many.

Tech companies like Meta must tread carefully. Privacy laws in places like Illinois, Texas, and the European Union already restrict certain uses of facial recognition, but technology often moves faster than regulation. For now, the responsibility falls on both companies and consumers to use these powerful tools ethically‚Äîand to push back when the line between helpful and harmful gets crossed.

# Next Week

After a calm stretch, get ready for a packed week. The big headline? Thursday‚Äôs Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which will serve as a key gauge for inflation and the Federal Reserve's ongoing fight to bring prices down. If inflation shows signs of cooling, expect markets to cheer. But if the report disappoints, more volatility could be on the horizon.

Before that, Tuesday kicks off with the NFIB optimism index, giving insight into small business sentiment‚Äîa vital metric since small businesses make up nearly half of U.S. GDP. Then, on Wednesday, we‚Äôll get a look at wholesale inventories, a key factor for understanding the pace of manufacturing and GDP growth.

Thursday isn‚Äôt just about CPI‚Äîweekly jobless claims will also roll in, giving an update on the labor market. And to finish the week strong, Friday‚Äôs Producer Price Index (PPI) will provide an early look at inflation from the perspective of manufacturers, followed by earnings reports from JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, signaling the start of a new earnings season.

As if that weren‚Äôt enough, we‚Äôll also hear from nine Federal Reserve officials throughout the week. Wall Street will be analyzing their every word for hints of what‚Äôs to come in monetary policy.

# Spirit Airlines Explores Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) is running out of fuel‚Äîfinancially speaking. After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It‚Äôs not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses.

Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîthe options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue‚Äôs coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations.

With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit‚Äôs balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking‚ÄîSpirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit‚Äôs credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes.

**A Rocky Ride**  
Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher.

Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies.

With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring.

# OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion at $157 Billion Valuation

Call OpenAI the Silicon Valley darling‚Äîthis AI powerhouse just scored $6.6 billion in fresh funding, catapulting its valuation to a staggering $157 billion. Thrive Capital, led by Josh Kushner, took the lead with a $1.3 billion investment, while Microsoft‚ÄîOpenAI‚Äôs most dedicated cheerleader‚Äîadded another $750 million to its $13 billion pile. Other heavy hitters like Khosla Ventures, Fidelity, Nvidia, and SoftBank couldn't resist jumping on the AI hype train.

With this cash infusion, OpenAI is officially rubbing shoulders with the elite‚Äîjoining the ranks of the top three venture-backed startups, alongside SpaceX and TikTok‚Äôs parent, ByteDance. But it‚Äôs not just about the dollars; it‚Äôs about strategy. OpenAI is playing it smart by keeping rivals at bay‚Äîasking investors to steer clear of backing competitors like Anthropic and Musk's xAI. Staying on top isn‚Äôt just about innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs about making sure others don‚Äôt catch up.

**Fueling the AI Dream**  
This new funding will power more AI research and expand computing capacity, keeping OpenAI at the forefront of the field. Their star attraction, ChatGPT, now flaunts 250 million weekly active users. But there‚Äôs a price to pay‚ÄîOpenAI expects to burn through $5 billion this year against $3.7 billion in revenue. Developing next-level AI tech isn‚Äôt exactly a budget-friendly hobby.

OpenAI‚Äôs internal shakeups have added to the drama. CEO Sam Altman got the boot and then came back like a Silicon Valley comeback story. Plus, key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati have exited, stirring uncertainty. There‚Äôs also talk of ditching the nonprofit label for a for-profit model‚Äîa move that makes investors giddy but could come with its own set of legal headaches.

**Zoom Out**  
AI is more than just cool tech‚Äîit‚Äôs a battleground, and OpenAI is right in the thick of it. Heavyweights like Google and Meta are breathing down its neck, while new challengers are cropping up everywhere. With a potential IPO on the horizon, Sam Altman and his team are betting big on their vision‚Äîand their capital.

Buckle up, because the AI race just went into overdrive.

# Tomorrow

Brace yourselves‚Äîtomorrow‚Äôs jobs report is shaping up to be a big one. Ever since July‚Äôs job data tanked the market, investors have been glued to these reports. That month‚Äôs lower-than-expected employment numbers had everyone panicking that the Fed might have missed the mark on managing a recession, sending stocks into a nosedive.

August helped ease those fears a bit, with 142,000 jobs added (a nice recovery from July‚Äôs 114,000) and unemployment holding steady at 4.2%. But the labor market remains in the spotlight, especially with the Fed tying future rate decisions to employment data. September‚Äôs numbers? Economists are eyeing 140,000 new jobs, a slight dip but nothing too alarming‚Äîunless it‚Äôs much lower. In that case, October‚Äôs already shaky market could take a serious hit.",10-04-2024

# Toyota Doubles Down on Flying Taxis¬†

Toyota‚Äôs getting ready for liftoff‚Äîliterally. The car giant is pumping an additional $500 million into Joby Aviation ($JOBY), the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) company that‚Äôs turning the flying taxi dream into a reality. This latest investment brings Toyota‚Äôs total stake in Joby to a cool $894 million, and it‚Äôs all part of a plan to ramp up commercial production of these futuristic air taxis by 2025.

Joby‚Äôs stock skyrocketed as much as 21% on the news, reminding everyone that the future of commuting might just be airborne.

**So, What‚Äôs the Buzz with Joby?**  
Joby isn‚Äôt your average startup‚Äîit‚Äôs a leader in the eVTOL space, which stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Translation: these are fully electric aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter but fly more efficiently like a plane. Powered by batteries, Joby‚Äôs aircraft are designed to whisk passengers over short distances, dodging traffic and cutting down travel time.

Imagine hopping into an air taxi and flying across town, all without worrying about traffic jams. That‚Äôs the future Joby‚Äôs working on, and they‚Äôre planning to launch their first commercial service in Dubai as soon as next year. However, they still need approval from the FAA and other regulators before this tech can really take off.

**A Match Made in the Sky**  
Toyota‚Äôs been in Joby‚Äôs corner since 2020, providing both funding and engineering expertise. The carmaker isn‚Äôt just throwing money at the problem; its engineers are working side-by-side with Joby to help streamline the aircraft‚Äôs manufacturing process. And Toyota isn‚Äôt new to tech gambles‚Äîthey‚Äôve been diving into everything from hydrogen-powered cars to autonomous driving. Now, air taxis are their next big bet.

Joby‚Äôs tech is seriously cool. Their eVTOL aircraft are nearly silent during flight and can carry four passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph. With a range of 150 miles on a single charge, they‚Äôre aiming to revolutionize urban mobility‚Äîno more bumper-to-bumper gridlock.

**Flying into the Future**  
The investment underscores how serious Toyota is about diversifying into futuristic modes of transportation. Joby‚Äôs aircraft could one day be the go-to for zipping from city to city or quickly hopping between airports, avoiding the dreaded rush-hour gridlock. But before you can book your flying Uber, there are hurdles like certification and public acceptance to overcome. Still, Joby has raised over $2 billion and is one of the few companies in the eVTOL space that‚Äôs well-funded enough to bring its vision to life.

With this cash infusion, Joby is poised to scale up production, and Toyota‚Äôs backing will play a key role in helping the startup take off‚Äîboth literally and figuratively.

# Tesla's Q3 Deliveries Hits a Bump

Tesla just posted its first quarterly sales increase of 2024, but don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet. Deliveries were up 6.4%, hitting 462,890 vehicles in Q3. Sounds good, right? Not exactly. Wall Street was hoping for more, especially after all the hype around China‚Äôs boosted EV subsidies. Analysts expected closer to 463,900. So, close but no cigar.

And Tesla‚Äôs stock? It dropped 3.5%‚Äîbecause investors don‚Äôt like being teased.

**China to the Rescue‚Ä¶ Sort of**  
China threw Tesla a bone with incentives aimed at spurring electric car demand, but even that couldn‚Äôt push deliveries over the finish line. Investors had been riding high on expectations, especially with Musk teasing an October 10th event to show off his long-promised robotaxis. Elon even called it ‚Äúone for the history books‚Äù (because of course he does).

But promises can only get you so far. Tesla‚Äôs shares had rallied 35% in the last two months, but this miss reminded everyone that not all that glitters is gold‚Äîor, in this case, electric.

**Tough Road Ahead**  
Tesla‚Äôs not just battling its delivery numbers; it‚Äôs wrestling with stiffer competition and customers‚Äô shrinking wallets, thanks to high interest rates. Sure, vehicle sales inched up, but Tesla‚Äôs energy business? Not so much. Energy storage took a nosedive, dropping 25% from Q2. Ouch.

If Tesla wants to hit its goal of selling 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, it‚Äôs going to need a massive Q4. And we‚Äôre talking¬†*massive.*

October 23rd is the next big date for Tesla‚Äôs Q3 earnings report‚Äîwhere everyone will be watching to see if Musk can pull off a fourth-quarter miracle.

Buckle up‚Äîtomorrow‚Äôs data dump is packed.

First, we‚Äôll get the weekly jobless claims. Last week, new unemployment claims dropped to 218,000, surprising just about everyone. Economists expect claims to creep back up to 220,000 tomorrow, but fingers crossed for another pleasant shock.

Then, there‚Äôs the S&P US Services PMI, which tells us how private sector services are doing. A score over 50 means business is booming, under 50 means the opposite. Last month, the PMI slipped slightly from 55.7 to 55.4, and economists are betting on more of the same this month.

Lastly, Factory Orders will give us a look at how manufacturers are holding up. Last time, orders jumped by 5%, but don‚Äôt get too excited‚Äîtomorrow‚Äôs forecast calls for a big ol‚Äô zero in growth.

# Iran Sends a Message... and Missiles

In a not-so-subtle move, Iran launched 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday evening, sending shockwaves across both the Middle East and global markets. The attack comes hot on the heels of Israel‚Äôs targeted killings of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, including the dramatic airstrike that took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Prime Minister Netanyahu, never one to shy away from a response, promised swift retaliation.

""Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it,"" Netanyahu stated.

Markets Feel the Heat  
This missile barrage didn't just light up the night sky ‚Äì it sent oil prices soaring over 5% as investors braced for potential supply disruptions. Global stock markets, already jittery, took a hit, with major indices retreating as traders sought safety in bonds and gold. The Dow dropped over 250 points, while oil bulls celebrated the sudden spike in WTI crude prices.

The Middle East remains a powder keg, and this latest escalation between Iran and Israel has made energy traders reach for their helmets.

Defensive Maneuvers  
Most of Iran's missiles were intercepted by Israel‚Äôs vaunted defense systems (with a little help from the U.S.), but a few managed to slip through. While the immediate damage was minimal, Netanyahu made it clear that Israel wouldn‚Äôt just let this slide. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden got involved, ordering American naval ships to fire interceptors in support of Israel.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: despite all the missile action, the market impact was limited... for now. Iran warned of further retaliation if Israel pushes back, and that looming threat could be enough to keep investors on edge.

The Aftershock  
Iran's show of force might have been aimed at Israel, but it sent ripples through global financial markets. Oil surges, stock dips, and safe-haven assets like bonds and gold saw some love. Investors, already skittish from broader geopolitical risks, aren't exactly thrilled about the idea of an expanded Middle Eastern conflict.

If the tension continues to escalate, expect volatility to hang around like that last guest who just won't leave the party.

# Dockworkers Launch Strike at Ports From Maine to Texas

Dockworkers from Maine to Texas have shut down some of the country‚Äôs busiest ports in a move that could strangle trade just as the holiday season gears up. The strike, led by the International Longshoremen‚Äôs Association (ILA), is driven by demands for a massive wage increase and resistance to port automation. Thousands of workers walked off the job early Tuesday, halting the flow of goods at critical trade hubs.

This is no ordinary labor dispute‚Äîit's a power play. Now he has laid down the gauntlet to Joe Biden, threatening to ‚Äúcripple‚Äù the US economy with strike action. And with the holiday season just around the corner, they have the leverage to do it.

Retailers Brace for Impact  
Big retailers, including Walmart, Costco, and IKEA, say they‚Äôve prepared for the strike by stocking up early and rerouting shipments to West Coast ports. But even they admit that a prolonged strike will drive up costs and could lead to shortages of key products. Shipping costs are already on the rise, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before consumers feel the pinch.

For now, holiday shoppers can breathe easy. But the longer this drags on, the harder it will be to keep shelves stocked.

Industries Feeling the Heat  
The auto industry, which relies heavily on East Coast ports for vehicle imports, is especially vulnerable. European carmakers like BMW and Volkswagen are expected to take the biggest hit. But not everyone is suffering‚Äîair freight companies like FedEx and UPS are positioned to cash in as businesses scramble for alternative shipping methods.

Some companies are prepared for the long haul, but even the best-prepared businesses won‚Äôt escape unscathed if the strike stretches beyond a week. JP Morgan analysts estimate the U.S. economy could lose up to $4.5 billion per day from the disruption.

Crippling the Economy?  
Harold Daggett isn‚Äôt playing around. He‚Äôs leading a movement that could bring the U.S. economy to its knees, just as it did during the last major dockworker strike in 1977. With billions at stake and mounting political pressure, it‚Äôs a waiting game to see how long businesses‚Äîand consumers‚Äîcan hold out.

This strike might be making history, but it‚Äôs also setting the stage for a holiday season none of us will forget.

# Nike‚Äôs Guidance? Just Do‚Ä¶ It Later

Nike is playing it cautious, hitting the snooze button on its full-year guidance and pushing off its investor day, originally set for November. Why? A new CEO, Elliott Hill, is about to step in, and the company‚Äôs latest earnings showed a 10% drop in sales, so there‚Äôs some serious catching up to do.

Sure, Nike beat earnings expectations by $0.18 per share, but revenue? Missed the mark. The company reported $11.59 billion, slightly under the $11.65 billion analysts were hoping for. Investors weren't thrilled‚Äîshares slipped 5.32% in after-hours trading.

New Boss, New Playbook?  
With Hill taking the reins soon, Nike‚Äôs buying some time. Postponing the investor day gives him space to craft a fresh strategy‚Äîmuch needed, considering Nike expects revenue to slide another 8-10% next quarter. Ouch.

Investors are holding their breath, and they‚Äôre not exactly feeling the love. Nike‚Äôs stock is down 18% this year, far behind the S&P 500‚Äôs 20% gain. Hill‚Äôs going to need more than a pep talk to turn this ship around.

A Few Silver Linings  
Not everything is gloomy in swoosh land. Nike‚Äôs gross margin came in higher than expected, hitting 45.4%, thanks to smart price adjustments and lower logistics costs. Plus, sales in Greater China outperformed, with that region showing some resilience.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough to make up for weakness in North America and Europe, where sales tumbled. Even Converse couldn‚Äôt lace up a win‚Äîcontinuing to weigh on overall performance.

Gross margin up, but sales still slipping.

What‚Äôs Next for Nike?  
As Hill steps in, he‚Äôll need to put the innovation pedal to the metal. Nike‚Äôs been leaning too hard on legacy lines like Air Jordans, Dunks, and Air Force 1s‚Äîshoes that used to sell out in seconds but now struggle to hold the same hype. Meanwhile, competitors like On and Hoka are running laps around them.

The bottom line? Investors are counting on Hill to reignite Nike‚Äôs product pipeline and rebuild retailer relationships. Whether he can pull off that comeback is the $11.59 billion question.

Tomorrow, it's time for another pulse check on the labor market with the ADP National Employment Report, giving us a look at private sector job growth across the U.S.

Yes, jobs are still being added, but the slowdown has economists sweating. For September, the magic number is 128,000. Anything less, and you can bet the Fed will be paying extra attention.

"Am I missing something?Hi guys! First time posting here, and I wanted to share my experience from my first day of trading.

In a few months, I‚Äôll be a father‚Äîspecifically a single father‚Äîand I really need money so I can spend as much time as possible with my son/daughter and give them the best life I can. A few months ago, I started with crypto, but for me, it was too slow. So last week, I came across Trade Republic and its turbo warrants.

The feeling I got from turbo warrants was that they seemed too good to be true. They are highly leveraged derivatives, but to me, they looked like easy money, and I thought the risks could be minimized by just paying attention to the numbers. Still, I felt like something was missing. Nobody gives away money that easily.

Today, I transferred ‚Ç¨1,000 to my account and started trading for just a few minutes. I made ‚Ç¨300 in less than an hour (just by buying and selling NVDA, Gold, Tesla, Visa... turbo warrants). Since it was my first time, I tried to be a bit greedy to see how risky I could get. I ended up losing some money, but the whole experience netted me ‚Ç¨190 in profits.

I know it‚Äôs not a lot compared to some people here who make thousands, but today I earned as much as I would in a day of work (I make ‚Ç¨2,100 a month). Maybe I won‚Äôt make that much money every day, but it really feels like if I‚Äôm not too greedy, I could maintain this level of profit daily.

So, the question is: am I missing something? Or is it really that easy to earn extra money?

**TL;DR:** I made ‚Ç¨190 in a day, and I‚Äôm suspicious it could be like this every day.",10-01-2024

"How I Use Bookmap to EASILY Identify Entries and ExitsI've been day trading for 7 years and have been a consistently losing trader. Prior to a month ago, I purely used technical analysis and chart patterns to identify setups, and I would hold and hope for 3R winners. Inevitably, 70% of the time, the candlesticks would rollover and I'd lose.

The problem with candlesticks and indicators is that they only tell you what might happen based on previous data. The only way (in my opinion) to truly have an edge as a day trader is by understanding how to read real-time order flow.

I'm using Bookmap now and I'm consistently green. Bookmap is a data visualization tool for order flow. It provides the same data that's on Level 2, but in a visual format.

If you're an idiot like me, Level 2 moves too fast, so it's difficult to see where big blocks of passive orders are. Those passive orders act as Support and Resistance.

**Real World Example From Today:**

My strategy is to scan for highly liquid stocks that are trending at the Open and then add stocks with clear levels of large passive limit orders to my watchlist. 

Then, I wait to see what the stock does at those levels (Support or Resistance). If it breaks, I buy. If it fails, I sell. In the example below from today, you'll notice the HUGE wall of orders at $18. Once it rejected and closed in the red, I shorted it at $17.82, with my Stop loss at $18. I covered my short for profit at the Pre-Market High (Purple line.) There wasn't a wall of Buyers anywhere near by that could act as a clear level of Support, where price might bounce higher, so I got out at the pre-market high to play it safe. Once that level hit, momentum crept up and price went higher for the rest of the day. I had already made my money before the reversal, so I was good to go!

I think it's important to note, that Bookmap doesn't seem to work well for small cap momentum stocks, simply because there typically aren't large passive orders sitting on the DOM. I hate small caps anyway, so this doesn't bother me. Small caps is a game of musical chairs. It's high stakes gambling. Not for me.

Mega caps like Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, etc. are good ones. 

**How are you using Bookmap?**

I'd love to know if anyone else has any simple strategies for Bookmap that they'd like to share. I use the version that's built into Thinkorswim, so the capabilities are limited.

# Cards Against Humanity to Elon Musk: ""Go F*** Yourself!""

*This party game company sued SpaceX for a $15M property trespass‚Äîand throws in some spicy words for good measure.*

Cards Against Humanity (CAH) just served Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX a $15 million lawsuit, claiming the aerospace giant has been treating their Texas land like its own personal junkyard. The card game company, famous for making you feel¬†*just a little*¬†uncomfortable at game night, bought the land back in 2017 as part of a stunt to block Trump‚Äôs border wall plans.

Now, CAH says SpaceX has rolled in uninvited, parking cars, stacking debris, and generally trashing the place. When confronted, SpaceX reportedly offered a ‚Äúlowball‚Äù deal to buy the land‚Äîat less than half its value. CAH‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúGo f\*\*\* yourself, Elon.‚Äù

**""Wait‚ÄîCards Against**¬†***Who*****?"":**¬†In case you missed the 2017 newsflash, CAH raised around $2.25 million from supporters to buy land in Cameron County, Texas, with the express goal of making life harder for Trump‚Äôs border wall construction. The plot was left in its ‚Äúnatural state,‚Äù with wild horses (allegedly) roaming free. But recently, SpaceX‚Äôs construction activities‚Äîlike compacting soil and setting up generators‚Äîhave, according to CAH, turned the land into a space-age parking lot.

**The Stakes? Wild Vegetation‚Äîand Customer Trust:**¬†CAH‚Äôs complaint goes beyond crushed plants. They argue that SpaceX‚Äôs invasion has damaged their precious brand-customer relationship. And let‚Äôs be honest‚Äînothing says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre here to fight for your rights‚Äù like defending a piece of borderland against the world‚Äôs richest man. They‚Äôre worried that fans might start thinking they‚Äôre somehow in cahoots with SpaceX, which is a big no-no for a company that thrives on anti-establishment vibes.

Meanwhile, SpaceX has been beefing with other locals too. Residents in the nearby village of Boca Chica say SpaceX has taken over their town‚Äîcomplete with statue removals and sign teardowns. Because, of course, space domination starts at home.

If CAH wins the lawsuit, each donor will see a nice little payday‚Äîabout $100‚Äîon their $15 contribution. That‚Äôs a 700% return, folks. Maybe the real winning card is legal action after all.

Meta CEO¬†*and part-time metaverse evangelist*¬†Mark Zuckerberg will lead the keynote, which you can catch on Meta‚Äôs website or Horizon Worlds (if you‚Äôre living that VR life). Alongside him will be CTO Andrew Bosworth, who will dive deeper into all things AI and AR.

# What's Coming?

Here‚Äôs the big stuff Meta might have in store:

* **A New, Cheaper VR Headset:**¬†Word on the street is Meta will unveil a stripped-down version of the Quest 3, the ""Quest 3S,"" priced at a more wallet-friendly $299. The goal? Offer a VR experience that doesn‚Äôt break the bank, without sacrificing too much of the Quest 3‚Äôs tech magic. If leaks are accurate, this model could bridge the gap between the aging Quest 2 and the pricey Quest 3.
* **Smart Glasses 2.0:**¬†Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban smart glasses are due for an update, and rumors suggest they‚Äôll be getting some AI juice. While the glasses won't quite be AR wizards yet, they‚Äôre expected to bring new features, like voice-controlled AI, straight to your stylish shades. Plus, we might get a glimpse of¬†*‚ÄúOrion,‚Äù*¬†Meta‚Äôs true AR glasses that could change how we see (literally) reality.
* **AI All Day, Every Day:**¬†AI will be the star of the show, with Meta expected to roll out new chatbot assistants, smarter AI-powered tools, and possibly some celebrity avatars.¬†*Llama 3.1*, Meta‚Äôs latest large language model, will likely pop up across Meta‚Äôs platforms‚Äîthink WhatsApp and Instagram with even more AI sass.

The keynote kicks off at 1 PM ET / 10 AM PT on September 25th. You can stream it via the Meta Connect website, Facebook, or catch it live in VR on Horizon Worlds.

Get ready for a busy week of economic updates, kicking off with the S&P Case-Shiller home price index. Last month‚Äôs report showed a 5.4% jump in home prices for June, setting a new all-time high for the fourth straight month. Spoiler alert: July probably won‚Äôt break the trend, but everyone‚Äôs hoping future rate cuts will bring mortgage rates‚Äîand home prices‚Äîdown eventually.

Next up, we‚Äôll get a read on US consumer confidence. While the mood improved between July and August, concerns about the job market crept up, and stock market jitters didn‚Äôt help either (thanks, August volatility). But after a surprisingly strong September, maybe shoppers are feeling a bit more optimistic.

# Nike Shakes It Up ‚Äî CEO Swap in the Works

Nike is tying its laces for a major shake-up at the top. Veteran exec Elliott Hill is making a comeback from retirement to replace CEO John Donahoe, who‚Äôs stepping down after a rocky five-year stint. The transition officially kicks off on October 14, a day after Donahoe‚Äôs last.

Nike's stock, which has slumped 25% this year, got a quick boost with an 11% surge in after-hours trading on the news. Wall Street seems ready for Hill to bring his fresh pair of kicks to the game.

**Donahoe's Legacy: The DTC Pivot :**¬†Donahoe pushed Nike into direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, shedding its partnerships with big-name retailers like Foot Locker and Macy‚Äôs in favor of e-commerce. But as the post-pandemic online shopping frenzy fizzled out, so did Nike‚Äôs ability to keep up with consumer demand. Meanwhile, upstarts like On and Hoka capitalized on the gap, leaving Nike struggling to keep pace.

**Enter Elliott Hill:**¬†With 30+ years at Nike, including a stint as president of consumer and marketplace, Hill is a familiar face to Swoosh insiders. He‚Äôs expected to steer the company back toward its roots, focusing on retail partnerships and new product development‚Äîareas where Nike has stumbled recently.

Hill‚Äôs return is also a shot of morale for the company‚Äôs workforce, which has been rattled by layoffs and internal restructuring. Analysts are hopeful that his deep brand knowledge and product development savvy will help Nike regain its footing. Investors will be watching closely during Nike‚Äôs upcoming investor day in November to see if Hill can hit the ground running.

# 23andMe‚Äôs Board Walks Out: Wojcicki's Big Gamble

It‚Äôs not every day that an entire board of directors walks out, but that‚Äôs exactly what just happened at 23andMe. All seven independent board members called it quits after clashing with CEO Anne Wojcicki over her plan to take the company private. Wojcicki, who co-founded the DNA-testing giant, proposed buying out the company at 40 cents a share‚Äîbut the board wasn‚Äôt feeling it, citing the lack of financial backing.

Despite the mass exodus, Wojcicki remains laser-focused on her goal, claiming 23andMe will thrive away from the short-term pressures of public markets. With the board gone, she‚Äôs now the only one steering the ship.

Remember when 23andMe was worth a cool $3.5 billion? Those days are long gone. Since going public in 2021, the company‚Äôs stock has plunged 99.9%, now sitting at a humble 34 cents a share. What happened? Turns out, once you‚Äôve taken a DNA test, there‚Äôs not much reason to take another.

In a bid to diversify, the company tried everything from drug discovery to subscription services, but nothing has stuck. Now, Wojcicki is betting that going private will give the company the breathing room it needs to fix its business model.

# What‚Äôs Next?

With the board out, Wojcicki is doubling down on her buyout plan, but it‚Äôs a gamble. Investors are waiting to see if she can pull it off or if this is just delaying the inevitable. The company‚Äôs been burning through cash and, without a new revenue stream, 23andMe might run out of time.

Wojcicki promises to bring on new independent directors soon, but will that be enough to turn things around? Stay tuned‚Äî23andMe‚Äôs future is looking uncertain.

# FedEx‚Äôs Bumpy Ride

FedEx shares nosedived 11% in after-hours trading after the shipping giant delivered some bad news: a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and a softer 2025 outlook. CEO Raj Subramaniam blamed a ‚Äúchallenging quarter‚Äù as customers ditched priority services for cheaper shipping options. The result? FedEx‚Äôs premium Express services took a hit, leaving the company scrambling to cut costs.

Investors weren‚Äôt thrilled, and FedEx wasn‚Äôt the only one feeling the pain. UPS shares also took a 2.8% hit, adding to the market‚Äôs growing concerns about the U.S. economy post-Fed rate cut.

**No Special Delivery for 2025:**¬†FedEx adjusted its full-year earnings forecast to between $20 and $21 per share‚Äîdown from $22. And if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the company's adjusted earnings for the quarter landed at $3.60 per share, way below Wall Street‚Äôs $4.75 expectations. Ouch.

While the company‚Äôs merger of its Ground and Express units was supposed to save money, the numbers haven‚Äôt quite added up yet. But FedEx still thinks it can hit $2.2 billion in cost savings this fiscal year. Fingers crossed.

**Slower, Cheaper, and Shrinking Volumes:**¬†Domestic shipping volumes dipped 3%, and with higher labor costs and fewer priority shipments, FedEx Freight took a hit too. The company is also winding down a major USPS contract, which isn‚Äôt helping matters.

Bottom line: FedEx is bracing for slow growth and belt-tightening, with revenue now expected to crawl up in the low single digits in 2025.

# Google Back in the Hot Seat ‚Äî The Antitrust Saga Continues

The Justice Department is back for round two with Google, and this time it‚Äôs all about ad-tech. Weeks after a judge ruled the tech behemoth was illegally dominating search, another trial kicks off, this time in Virginia, targeting Google‚Äôs stronghold on digital advertising technology. The lawsuit claims Google has an unlawful monopoly over tools that buy and sell digital ads‚Äîtools that are essential for keeping online publishers afloat.

# The Case: Google‚Äôs Ad-Tech Monopoly?

The trial, expected to last several weeks, aims to determine whether Google‚Äôs control of both the buy-side and sell-side of the ad-tech ecosystem is crushing competition. The Justice Department, backed by 17 states, argues that Google‚Äôs practices have locked out rivals, with advertisers and publishers feeling forced to use its tools. They‚Äôre demanding Google shed its Ad Manager, which generated $368 million in profits from $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 alone.

This isn‚Äôt the first time Google has been hit with monopoly claims. A federal judge recently ruled that Google illegally maintained dominance in search, but this case could potentially cut deeper. If Google loses, it might have to sell off key parts of its advertising business, which is crucial to Alphabet‚Äôs overall revenue‚Äî78% of its $307 billion annual earnings come from advertising.

# Google‚Äôs Defense: The Market Has Changed

In response, Google claims the Justice Department is stuck in the past, focusing on outdated desktop advertising models while consumer attention has shifted to mobile apps, social media, and streaming platforms like TikTok and Peacock. Google‚Äôs legal team insists that the ad-tech space is more competitive than ever, with alternatives like Microsoft and Amazon gaining ground.

But the trial has already hit some bumps for Google. The company is facing scrutiny for allegedly deleting internal chat messages relevant to the case, something the judge criticized as ""not the way a responsible corporate entity should function."" This issue could factor into how the court weighs the credibility of witnesses.

# What‚Äôs Next for Google?

The trial, held without a jury, could significantly alter Google‚Äôs ad-tech empire. A government win would likely mean divesting parts of Google‚Äôs ad business, untangling years of acquisitions. With Google‚Äôs advertising technology so deeply embedded in the digital landscape, this case could reshape the industry for advertisers and publishers alike. And with antitrust regulators in both the U.S. and Europe breathing down its neck, Google‚Äôs struggles are far from over.

This is just the beginning of a legal battle that could send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# CPI Tomorrow ‚Äî Inflation Data Holds the Key

This week, the Federal Reserve is set to get its final look at inflation numbers before its next policy meeting on September 18. With interest rate cuts all but certain, the key question now is: how big will the cut be? The answer hinges on two upcoming inflation reports‚Äîthe Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). These reports are expected to clarify the Fed‚Äôs next move, especially after Friday‚Äôs jobs report provided little guidance.

# CPI & PPI: The Deciding Factors

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August‚Äôs CPI report, followed by the PPI on Thursday. Economists are predicting a 0.2% monthly increase for both headline and core CPI, bringing annual inflation rates to 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively. The PPI is expected to mirror these figures. While the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, this week‚Äôs CPI and PPI readings will still play a crucial role in determining the size of the upcoming rate cut.

The debate is now centered on whether the Fed will opt for a modest 25-basis-point cut or go bigger with a 50-basis-point reduction. Futures markets currently favor a quarter-point cut, with odds hovering around 71%. However, a stronger-than-expected inflation reading could push the Fed toward a more aggressive move. Economists like Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, believe inflation data should be favorable for at least a small cut.

# Shifting Focus: From Inflation to Jobs

While inflation has been the Fed's main concern for months, the focus is now turning toward the labor market. Hiring has slowed significantly, with nonfarm payroll gains averaging just 135,000 per month since April, down from 255,000 in the prior five months. Job openings have also declined, raising fears that the labor market is weakening. This shift has increased expectations that the Fed will begin cutting rates sooner rather than later, starting with a baby step at the next meeting.

# What‚Äôs Next?

After this week‚Äôs inflation reports, all eyes will be on the Fed‚Äôs September 18 meeting. If the data shows more progress in curbing inflation, the central bank may lean toward a larger rate cut. But even if the Fed starts small, markets expect more cuts to follow, with a possible half-point reduction in November and another in December. As the Fed navigates these murky waters, the balance between taming inflation and supporting a cooling labor market will guide its next moves.

# 



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Inflation‚Äôs about to take center stage again. Tomorrow, we get the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) report‚Äîaka, the data that shows how much more (or less) expensive life has gotten over the past year. While the Fed has plenty of tools to gauge inflation, CPI is the star of the show‚Äîespecially core CPI, which leaves out the drama of volatile food and energy prices.

Economists are penciling in a 0.2% rise for August, same as July‚Äôs bump. If that holds, it would push annual inflation down from 2.9% to 2.6%. Core inflation is also expected to clock in at 3.2% year-over-year. If these numbers land as predicted, the Fed will probably have the green light to trim rates by 25 basis points at next week‚Äôs meeting.

# August Jobs Report: Not Great, Not Terrible

It looks like the Fed has some tough choices to make after August‚Äôs jobs report hit with a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù response. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs‚Äîbetter than July‚Äôs nerve-wracking numbers but not the blowout people were hoping for. The unemployment rate also dipped a little to 4.2%, which might calm some nerves but doesn‚Äôt answer the big question: Will the Fed cut rates by a quarter-point or go bold with a half-point?

# What Happened?

The Fed‚Äôs been itching to cut rates, especially after June and July‚Äôs job growth took a nosedive. But Friday‚Äôs report was like a Goldilocks situation‚Äînot too hot, not too cold. The headline numbers weren‚Äôt weak enough to scream ‚Äúemergency,‚Äù but downward revisions to the summer months suggest things aren‚Äôt looking as strong as they seemed.

Here‚Äôs what we know:

* **Job growth**: 142,000 in August, following revised numbers from June and July, which showed 86,000 fewer jobs than previously reported.
* **Unemployment**: A modest dip to 4.2%.
* **Wage growth**: Hourly earnings ticked up 3.8% year-over-year, a small silver lining for workers.

# Fed's Dilemma: 25 or 50?

With the Fed‚Äôs next meeting on Sept. 18, central bankers are torn between two options:

* **The safe bet**: Cut rates by 25 basis points to keep things steady and avoid rocking the boat.
* **The bold move**: Go for a 50 basis point cut to really send a message and juice the economy. Some argue that the summer hiring slowdown justifies this.

So, what‚Äôs the vibe on Wall Street? Uncertainty. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7% on Friday, marking its worst week in 18 months. The bond market also reacted with 10-year Treasury yields dipping to their lowest point in over a year.

# Fed Speak

Fed Governor Christopher Waller hinted that a sequence of cuts is likely but didn‚Äôt give a clear signal on whether they‚Äôll go for the big 50 basis point cut just yet. Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams remained non-committal, saying he didn‚Äôt have a firm view on the size of the cut.

In short, the Fed‚Äôs in a wait-and-see mode, leaving markets jittery heading into September.

# What‚Äôs Next?

While August‚Äôs job report wasn‚Äôt a disaster, it didn‚Äôt exactly boost confidence, either. Economists are now looking ahead to see if the Fed will play it safe with a smaller cut or go for a bigger move to jumpstart the economy. Whatever happens, it‚Äôs going to keep markets on their toes.

# Selena Gomez Joins the Billionaire Club

Selena Gomez has officially entered the billionaire club, and it's not from breaking records on the Billboard charts. Her beauty brand, Rare Beauty, has turned the 32-year-old actress, singer, and entrepreneur into one of the youngest self-made billionaires in the U.S., with a fortune of $1.3 billion, according to Bloomberg. But don‚Äôt be fooled‚Äîthis success story goes way beyond a pop star simply slapping her name on some lip gloss.

# The Rare Billionaire Formula

The vast bulk of Selena's wealth‚Äîaround $1.1 billion‚Äîcomes from her 51% stake in Rare Beauty, the makeup line she launched in 2020. It‚Äôs a brand that hit big with influencers and Gen Z, generating $350 million in revenue last year. Rare Beauty isn't just another celeb-founded brand; it‚Äôs become a beauty powerhouse, outshining competitors like Jessica Alba‚Äôs Honest Co. and Lady Gaga‚Äôs Haus Labs. What makes it stand out? For starters, Selena marketed it as affordable, high-quality, and inclusive, with a message that celebrates authenticity. No wonder it‚Äôs selling out faster than her concert tickets.

But it‚Äôs not all about making bank. Rare Beauty donates 1% of its sales to the Rare Impact Fund, which aims to raise $100 million over the next decade to support mental health services. The fund is deeply personal to Gomez, who has been candid about her own struggles with bipolar disorder. This combination of purpose-driven business and beauty innovation has not only cemented Rare Beauty‚Äôs place in the market but also earned Gomez a loyal customer base.

# Diversifying Her Empire

While Rare Beauty is the crown jewel of her portfolio, Selena is far from a one-trick pony. She‚Äôs got her hands in several pots, and it‚Äôs paying off big time. Her mental health startup, Wondermind, which she co-founded with her mom and Daniella Pierson of¬†*The Newsette*, was valued at $100 million in 2022. It‚Äôs backed by investors like Sequoia Capital and Serena Williams‚Äôs venture fund. Wondermind is all about providing accessible mental health tools and resources, and it fits neatly into Selena‚Äôs broader mission of mental health advocacy.

Then there‚Äôs her acting career, which is booming. Selena stars alongside comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short in¬†*Only Murders in the Building*, raking in at least $6 million per season. The Hulu hit just kicked off its fourth season, and Selena‚Äôs performance as the quirky, mysterious Mabel Mora has earned her an Emmy nomination. While she may have started her career as a Disney darling, Selena‚Äôs acting chops and producing gigs (she‚Äôs also an executive producer on the show) are proving she‚Äôs got serious staying power in Hollywood.

# Brand Partnerships and Social Media Power

When Selena‚Äôs not in front of the camera or overseeing Rare Beauty, she‚Äôs leveraging her massive social media following‚Äî424 million Instagram followers, making her the third most followed person on the platform, trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. That digital clout has scored her major brand deals. She inked a $30 million deal with Puma and a $10 million contract with Coach. These partnerships, combined with her music royalties and acting roles, have only added to her ever-growing fortune.

What‚Äôs fascinating is that while Selena‚Äôs music career helped launch her into the public eye, it‚Äôs not a major source of her wealth. Unlike her friend Taylor Swift, who owns much of her songwriting catalog, Selena‚Äôs music earnings come primarily from performance royalties. Her last tour was back in 2016, and while it raked in $30 million, music accounts for less than 5% of her total net worth. Smart move? Absolutely. Selena has built a diversified empire that isn‚Äôt tied to the volatile ups and downs of the music industry.

# Building a Legacy

So, what‚Äôs next for Selena? For now, she‚Äôs keeping her focus on acting and business, hinting that while she might have one more album in her, her passion lies elsewhere. ‚ÄúI would probably choose acting,‚Äù she revealed on a recent episode of the¬†*SmartLess*¬†podcast. She‚Äôs also expanding her empire into new projects, including executive producing a reboot of her Disney Channel hit¬†*Wizards of Waverly Place*.

And let‚Äôs not forget the potential growth of Rare Beauty. While Selena has fielded offers to sell the brand, including a reported $2 billion valuation, she‚Äôs publicly said she has no plans to let go of her beauty baby anytime soon. Given Rare‚Äôs rapid rise and staying power, she might be right to hold on and ride the wave.

Selena‚Äôs success isn‚Äôt just a stroke of good luck‚Äîit‚Äôs a carefully crafted blend of talent, business savvy, and authenticity. She‚Äôs created multiple revenue streams, invested in long-term ventures, and built a brand that resonates deeply with her fans. At just 32, she‚Äôs already established herself as a mogul in the beauty industry and beyond.

# The Rare Takeaway

Selena Gomez‚Äôs ascent to billionaire status is proof that being a multi-hyphenate pays off‚Äîliterally. While her journey started as a child star on¬†*Barney & Friends*¬†and Disney‚Äôs¬†*Wizards of Waverly Place*, she‚Äôs grown into a force to be reckoned with, using her platform to not only build a fortune but to also promote causes she cares deeply about. Rare Beauty is much more than a makeup brand; it‚Äôs a testament to her vision, resilience, and commitment to being authentic, both on and off the screen.

Her next chapter? Whatever it is, it‚Äôs sure to be¬†*rare*¬†and profitable.

# Next Week

Next week‚Äôs lineup is looking pretty light, but there‚Äôs one report that‚Äôs got everyone buzzing.

On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) drops, and it‚Äôs a big one. CPI is the go-to inflation gauge, and whatever it shows could nudge the Federal Reserve toward its next move. Last month, inflation rose 2.9% over the past year‚Äîthe smallest jump since March 2021. If the cooling trend continues, it‚Äôll give the Fed even more reason to consider cutting rates later this month.

And while earnings season is wrapping up, there are still a few stragglers worth watching. Keep your eyes peeled.

# Verizon To Acquire Frontier

Verizon is making some serious moves in the broadband game, dropping $9.6 billion to acquire Frontier Communications. Toss in Frontier‚Äôs debt, and the total deal hits $20 billion, giving Verizon access to Frontier‚Äôs 2.2 million fiber subscribers across 25 states. Why does this matter? Verizon is locking down its spot in the fiber race, going head-to-head with AT&T and cable companies that are nibbling away at its market share.

# A Strategic Fiber Expansion

Frontier‚Äôs investors are walking away with a nice 37% premium at $38.50 per share. For Verizon, it‚Äôs a big pivot as it looks to bulk up its fiber footprint in key markets. By scooping up Frontier‚Äôs assets, Verizon merges those with its 7.4 million Fios subscribers in nine states and Washington, D.C. Fun fact: some of these assets were actually Verizon‚Äôs before they sold them to Frontier in 2016 for $10.54 billion. CEO Hans Vestberg said this is all about ‚Äúfuture-proofing‚Äù as data demand keeps exploding, thanks to AI and other data-hungry technologies.

# The Fiber Race Heats Up

Everyone wants in on the fiber game these days. AT&T is going all out with its own fiber network expansion, while T-Mobile just threw down $4.9 billion on a joint venture to boost its fiber capabilities. Verizon‚Äôs acquisition of Frontier, though, gives it a big leg up in the race to deliver faster and more reliable internet to customers. With wireless growth slowing, telecoms are betting that home internet is the next cash cow.

But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing. Frontier‚Äôs stock dipped 9.3% after the news, as investors brace for what could be a lengthy regulatory review. There‚Äôs also doubt about whether any other bidders will emerge. The deal is expected to take around 18 months to close, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Verizon, already carrying over $120 billion in debt, is banking on $500 million in annual cost savings by year three to make this deal worth it.

# What‚Äôs Next for Verizon?

This acquisition signals Verizon‚Äôs commitment to going fiber-first. With Frontier‚Äôs assets in key areas like California, Texas, and Florida, Verizon will now serve a total of 10 million fiber-optic customers. It‚Äôs still playing catch-up to AT&T‚Äôs 28 million, but this is a step in the right direction. Even though Verizon‚Äôs fiber network will cover less than 10% of the U.S., the company sees this deal as a building block for bigger broadband dominance.

In a nutshell, Verizon is doubling down on fiber to keep up with our increasingly data-hungry world. It‚Äôs a high-stakes play, but if the company can execute, this move could give it a major leg up as the demand for faster, more reliable internet continues to surge. And don‚Äôt be surprised if the fiber race gets even more competitive from here.

# All Eyes on Friday's Jobs Report

Friday‚Äôs jobs report could be the mic drop moment for the U.S. economy, with Wall Street bracing for impact. Economists are expecting a moderate gain of 161,000 jobs in August, a slight improvement from July‚Äôs underwhelming 114,000, and a dip in unemployment to 4.2%. But don‚Äôt be fooled by the numbers; a recent wave of grim data suggests the labor market might be cooling faster than a pumpkin spice latte in December.

# The Fed Factor

The Fed is teetering on the edge of a rate cut, with markets betting that a quarter-point reduction is a done deal, and a half-point cut could be on the table if Friday's report looks dicey. With rates currently at their highest in 23 years, the central bank may need to act fast to avoid the ‚ÄúR‚Äù word‚Äîrecession. (We hate to say it, too.)

Giacomo Santangelo, economist at Monster, sums it up: ""The labor market is cooling, but the Fed‚Äôs next move depends on how chilly things get on Friday.""

# Jobs Data Drama

July was a wake-up call, with payroll growth dragging and the private sector adding just 99,000 jobs in August‚Äîits weakest performance since 2021, according to ADP. Companies are cutting back on hiring faster than a Hollywood script rewrite, but layoffs haven‚Äôt surged‚Ä¶ yet.

The big question: How long can businesses play defense with hiring freezes before they hit the layoff button? Tech firms are already feeling the squeeze, accounting for over half of August‚Äôs 75,891 job cuts, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. AI isn‚Äôt helping either‚Äîit‚Äôs cutting into nearly 6,000 of those tech jobs.

# What to Watch

Alongside job gains and unemployment, economists will be eyeing several indicators in Friday‚Äôs report:

* **Hours worked**: Average workweek hours fell slightly in July, and a further dip could signal reduced demand.
* **Labor force participation**: More people jumping back into the job market could mean optimism‚Äîor a higher unemployment rate.
* **Temporary layoffs**: July saw a jump in temp layoffs, largely due to auto industry retooling. If those turn permanent, buckle up.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow‚Äôs the moment of truth: the US jobs report is dropping, giving us a pulse check on the labor market. This data-packed report pulls info from all over and delivers the clearest view of employment in the country.

Last month, it didn‚Äôt go so well. July‚Äôs report showed only 114,000 jobs added, far below expectations, which sent the stock market into a nosedive. The concern? That the Fed might not have enough ammo to fend off a downturn.

For August, the forecast is looking a bit brighter‚Äîeconomists expect 161,000 new jobs and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. If the numbers fall short again, brace for another market slide. The silver lining? Bad news could nudge the Fed to go bigger with rate cuts next month.

# Chase A Check‚Ä¶ Or Maybe 3 Years In Prison

Hold onto your debit cards, folks! Chase Bank has come forward to debunk a viral trend that‚Äôs been circulating on TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). The so-called ""glitch"" that supposedly lets users deposit fake checks and withdraw real money? Yeah, not a glitch. It‚Äôs fraud.

Over the weekend, videos flooded social media with users claiming they could deposit phony checks at Chase ATMs and withdraw the funds before the bank caught on. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs a crime. Chase quickly addressed the situation, reminding customers that this is fraud, ""plain and simple."" The bank's message was clear‚Äîno matter what TikTok tells you, check fraud is still very much illegal.

# Check Out the Reality Check

Despite what the hype might suggest, this isn't some revolutionary new money hack. The tactic of depositing fake checks and withdrawing cash before they bounce is as old as checks themselves. Fraudsters usually pull this off by opening accounts under fake names, but this time around, people tried it with their own accounts‚Äîmaking it super easy for Chase to identify and slam the door shut.

In a statement, a Chase spokesperson said, ""We are aware of this incident, and it has been addressed."" Translation: We caught on fast, and we're not amused.

# TikTok‚Äôers Learn the Hard Way

The internet had a field day with this one. What started as videos of users showing off stacks of cash quickly turned into clips of them facing massive negative balances and holds on their accounts. One user summed it up perfectly: ‚ÄúChase Bank glitch? No, that‚Äôs called fraud. You went to the bank and took $50,000 that didn‚Äôt belong to you. That‚Äôs not a life hack; that‚Äôs called robbery.‚Äù

So, here‚Äôs the takeaway: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stick to real jobs or legit side hustles, and leave the check fraud to the scammers. They‚Äôre not going to win any awards, but at least they know what they‚Äôre signing up for.

* **Same-Store Sales Growth:**¬†+0.7% overall; +1.3% at Dollar Tree stores; -0.1% at Family Dollar stores

Not everything is priced at a dollar, including Dollar Tree‚Äôs ($DLTR) stock, which plunged over 22% on Wednesday after the company slashed its full-year outlook. The discount retailer blamed rising pressures on middle- and higher-income customers who are feeling the pinch and spending less on non-essentials.

# What Went Wrong?

Dollar Tree had to face some harsh realities this quarter. The company now expects its full-year net sales to come in between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion, a drop from the previously anticipated $31 billion to $32 billion. Adjusted earnings per share were also revised down to a range of $5.20 to $5.60, from a higher $6.50 to $7. Not exactly the kind of news investors were hoping for.

So, what‚Äôs causing all this trouble? According to CFO Jeff Davis, the company is dealing with softer sales, especially on the discretionary side‚Äîbasically, anything that isn't an absolute necessity. They‚Äôve also had to pay more in costs related to customer accidents at their stores and expenses from converting 99 Cents Only stores. Not the most fun way to spend your cash.

# Dollar Stores Aren‚Äôt Feeling So Discounted

Dollar Tree isn‚Äôt the only one feeling the burn. Last week, Dollar General also cut its full-year forecast, noting that its core customers are feeling financially squeezed. Meanwhile, big names like Walmart and even online newcomers like Temu are capturing the attention of budget-conscious shoppers.

For Dollar Tree, same-store sales in the latest quarter inched up by just 0.7%, with the Dollar Tree stores themselves seeing a 1.3% rise and Family Dollar stores dipping slightly by 0.1%. The modest gains are a clear sign that customers are tightening their belts and making fewer trips for non-essentials.

# Facing Headwinds and Hard Choices

Beyond consumer belt-tightening, Dollar Tree is grappling with some company-specific challenges. It‚Äôs shutting down about 1,000 underperforming Family Dollar stores and might even sell off the Family Dollar brand. This move comes after struggling to integrate the grocery-focused chain, which it bought for nearly $9 billion in 2015.

On top of that, the company‚Äôs dealing with a slew of liability claims from customer accidents, which are proving to be more costly and unpredictable than expected. These added expenses aren‚Äôt doing any favors for their bottom line.

Dollar Tree is hoping that the back-to-school season and upcoming holidays might give them a boost, but with consumers being extra cautious with their spending, it might take more than just a sale on party supplies to turn things around. Until then, it‚Äôs clear that not even Dollar Tree can escape the effects of a tough economic climate.

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow's lineup has the labor market taking center stage with two big headliners: the ADP Employment Report and initial jobless claims, both dropping bright and early.

First up, the ADP Employment Report‚Äîour monthly pulse check on private sector hiring. Last time around, the report showed 122,000 new jobs, paired with a 4.8% bump in annual pay. Decent stats, but they didn‚Äôt exactly get economists popping champagne. For July, the forecast is a bit more festive, with predictions of 140,000 new jobs.

On the flip side, initial jobless claims will tell us how many folks filed for unemployment benefits last week. The latest count was 231,000, a slight dip of 2,000 from the week before. The experts are crossing their fingers for a further drop to 225,000 in tomorrow's report.

# Before Market Open:

* **Nio**¬†($NIO) has been on a rough road this year, heading mostly downhill. The Chinese electric vehicle maker is facing fierce competition at home, struggling to turn a profit, and consistently falling short on delivery targets. With so many strikes against it, Nio isn‚Äôt exactly inspiring confidence among investors. Unless you‚Äôre feeling particularly adventurous, this might be one to watch from the sidelines for now. The consensus is a loss of $0.31 per share on $2.44 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* **Broadcom**¬†($AVGO) has lagged behind its AI-driven peers this year, despite delivering robust earnings. Investors have been cautious due to the company‚Äôs aggressive acquisition strategy, which has significantly increased its debt load. However, management is confident that these moves will drive substantial sales growth and strengthen the balance sheet in the future. Wall Street seems optimistic, with 22 out of 23 analysts rating the stock a buy and setting an average price target 27% above its current level. The consensus calls for earnings of $1.09 per share on $11.71 billion in revenue.",09-05-2024

# Buffett's Berkshire Joins the Trillion-Dollar Club¬†

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just hit a whopping $1 trillion market cap, becoming the first non-tech U.S. company to join the exclusive trillion-dollar club. Take that, Silicon Valley!

Berkshire's stock has been on a roll this year, climbing 30% in 2024 and outpacing the S&P 500's 17% gain. The company's strong performance has been fueled by robust insurance results, economic optimism, and the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate cuts on the horizon.

# Old-School Cool with a Modern Twist¬†

Unlike its techy trillion-dollar club companions‚Äîthink Apple ($AAPL), Microsoft, and Nvidia‚ÄîBerkshire's success is built on what some might call ""old-school"" businesses. We're talking railways, insurance, and Dairy Queen blizzards, not cloud computing or AI chips.

Buffett, who took over a floundering textile company in the 1960s and transformed it into this sprawling conglomerate, has proven that slow and steady does indeed win the race. Even with a significant chunk of Berkshire's portfolio invested in Apple, the firm's focus on value over flashy growth has paid off big time.

# Cash Moves and Strategic Shifts¬†

Recently, Buffett has been in what some might call ""defensive mode."" He's been trimming Berkshire's holdings in some heavyweights like Apple and Bank of America, building up a record cash pile of about $277 billion. This cautious approach has some investors speculating whether the Oracle of Omaha is seeing storm clouds on the economic horizon.

Buffett might be getting ready for more acquisition opportunities or simply reinforcing Berkshire's reputation as a safe haven amidst market uncertainty. Whatever the case, his strategy appears to be working‚Äîinvestors are rewarding Berkshire's steady hand with a spot in the trillion-dollar club.

# What‚Äôs Next?¬†

Looking ahead, Berkshire's all-weather portfolio seems well-positioned for whatever the future holds. The company might not boast eye-popping growth, but it's hard to argue with a steady performer in a world of market volatility.

As Greg Abel prepares to step into Buffett's legendary shoes, only time will tell if Berkshire can continue its winning streak. But for now, the Oracle of Omaha's empire is basking in the glow of a trillion-dollar valuation‚Äîa testament to the power of patience, prudence, and, of course, a good old-fashioned blizzard from Dairy Queen.

# Nvidia: Not Quite Perfect

# By the Numbers:

* **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**¬†$0.68 adjusted vs. $0.64 expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$30 billion vs. $28.9 billion expected
* **Q3 Revenue Forecast:**¬†$32.5 billion vs. $31.9 billion expected (but fell short of high estimates up to $37.9 billion)
* **Stock Movement:**¬†Down -5.87% in extended trading

Nvidia ($NVDA) just dropped their latest earnings report, and while it wasn't a total disaster, it also didn't have us popping champagne. The chipmaker forecasted third-quarter revenue of $32.5 billion, which is technically higher than the average analyst estimate of $31.9 billion. But here's the catch: some pie-in-the-sky expectations were up to $37.9 billion. As a result, Nvidia's stock took a 5% dip in late trading, adding a reality check to its gravity-defying run this year.

* **Chip Slip:**¬†The culprit behind this lukewarm reception? Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. The company admitted to hitting some production snags, which means they‚Äôre tinkering with manufacturing processes to boost yields (think: more functioning chips per batch). While CEO Jensen Huang reassured everyone that the ""anticipation for Blackwell is incredible,"" the market isn't big on anticipation‚Äîit‚Äôs all about execution.
* **Data Center Dominance:**¬†Nvidia has been riding the AI boom like a pro surfer catching a killer wave. With nearly 88% of its revenue coming from data center chips, Nvidia is the go-to for AI accelerators. Last quarter, they pulled in $26.3 billion from their data-center division alone, handily beating the $25.1 billion estimate. Their gaming segment isn‚Äôt too shabby either, with $2.9 billion in sales. But let‚Äôs face it, all eyes are on their AI chips powering the likes of ChatGPT.
* **Competition Heating Up:**¬†Nvidia‚Äôs success hasn't gone unnoticed. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) are scrambling to grab a slice of the AI pie, even if their combined revenues only account for about 5% of Nvidia‚Äôs total. Meanwhile, Nvidia continues to expand its lead, having shipped samples of its Blackwell chips despite the production hiccups.
* **AI Boom or Bust? :**¬†With a market cap north of $3 trillion, Nvidia has been the belle of the AI ball. Yet, the soaring spending on AI infrastructure has some wondering if we're heading towards a bubble. Nvidia remains optimistic, projecting that the demand for its AI chips will continue to skyrocket. Investors, on the other hand, might be looking for more than just optimism after the stock‚Äôs recent rollercoaster ride.

For now, it looks like Nvidia is still in the driver's seat of the AI revolution. But with production challenges and rising competition, they'll need to keep their foot on the gas.

# Temu‚Äôs Parent Company PDD Takes a Dive

PDD Holdings ($PDD), the proud parent of budget shopping sensation Temu, just took a nasty tumble down the stock market stairs. After posting lackluster quarterly sales and giving a gloomy forecast, shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant plummeted 28.5% on Monday, marking the steepest single-day drop in the company's history. Ouch.

# Not-So-Sunny Outlook

What‚Äôs behind this dramatic fall from grace? It turns out, PDD‚Äôs latest revenue figures didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark. The company reported revenue of $13.36 billion for Q2, falling short of Wall Street's forecast of $14.03 billion. That's a miss that investors didn't take lightly. Jun Liu, PDD‚Äôs VP of finance, didn‚Äôt sugarcoat the situation, warning of ‚Äúintensified competition and external challenges‚Äù that could continue to put pressure on growth and profitability. In other words, it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road ahead.

Even with a massive marketing push and heavy investments in expansion, the slowdown is evident. The company noted that Chinese consumers are shifting their spending from goods to experiences‚Äîthink less shopping, more eating out and entertainment. This shift, coupled with an ailing Chinese economy, has left PDD scrambling to adjust its strategy. And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, rivals like Alibaba ($BABA) and JD. com ($JD) are also feeling the heat, posting weaker-than-expected results in the face of changing consumer behaviors and economic conditions.

# All About That Budget Life

Despite the challenges at home, PDD has been casting a wider net, particularly in Europe and beyond, trying to capture the global audience‚Äôs attention with Temu's low-cost charm. And it‚Äôs not just the usual suspects like Alibaba that PDD has to worry about‚Äîeveryone from TikTok‚Äôs parent company ByteDance to Amazon is vying for the budget-conscious shopper‚Äôs dollar.

PDD‚Äôs plan? Double down on investment, even if it means sacrificing short-term profits. Chairman and Co-CEO Chen Lei made it clear that they‚Äôre willing to accept ‚Äúshort-term sacrifices‚Äù to build a stronger foundation for the future. In the meantime, PDD is focusing on cleaning up its platform by supporting high-quality merchants and cracking down on the lower-quality ones.

# What‚Äôs Next?

With competition heating up and consumer spending on the decline, PDD is gearing up for a fight to maintain its spot in the e-commerce world. While the company has made significant strides in gaining ground against giants like Alibaba and JD. com, it's clear that they‚Äôre in for a tough battle both at home and abroad. The days ahead will tell whether PDD‚Äôs aggressive growth strategy will pay off or if it‚Äôll face more turbulence in the marketplace.

# Telegram CEO Pavel Durov Detained in France

Telegram CEO Pavel Durov just found himself in hot water in France‚Äîand not the ice-cold baths he‚Äôs famously fond of. The 39-year-old billionaire was detained at an airport outside Paris, suspected of allowing illegal activity to run rampant on Telegram, the messaging app he founded. If you‚Äôre picturing Durov scrolling through a flurry of encrypted messages, sipping his French espresso, think again.

French authorities aren‚Äôt thrilled with Telegram‚Äôs hands-off approach to content moderation, and they‚Äôve made it known. Durov‚Äôs arrest, which could be extended by 24 hours, is part of a broader investigation into online criminality.¬†Allegations range from the distribution of child exploitation material to fraud and cyberbullying. Durov‚Äôs failure to cooperate with law enforcement on these matters didn‚Äôt help his case either.

# Russian Roulette

The plot thickens with some political spice‚ÄîDurov‚Äôs arrest has sparked a wave of reactions. The Russian Embassy in Paris quickly demanded explanations from French authorities, while Elon Musk took to X (formerly Twitter) to rally support for Durov with a ‚Äú#FreePavel‚Äù hashtag, suggesting this is an assault on free speech.

President Emmanuel Macron, however, insists there‚Äôs no political motivation here. He assured that Durov‚Äôs arrest was purely a legal matter, not a diplomatic chess move. Macron‚Äôs statement comes as French authorities crack down on platforms like Telegram, which they believe facilitate illegal activities due to lax content oversight.

# Telegram‚Äôs Wild Ride

Founded in 2013, Telegram quickly became a hit, especially in countries with strict censorship. It‚Äôs been a crucial communication tool for both Ukrainian officials and the Russian government during the ongoing war, making it a favorite for those who value privacy‚Äîand for some, a tool for illicit activity.

With over 900 million users, Telegram has also been a thorn in the side of governments worldwide, thanks to its encrypted messaging and limited moderation. Durov, who lives in Dubai and holds citizenship in France and the UAE, might be the latest high-profile tech CEO to face the consequences of this tension between free speech and regulation.

# What‚Äôs Next?

As Durov waits to see if his detention will be extended, the tech world is watching closely. Will he face charges, or is this just a scare tactic? For now, Telegram‚Äôs CEO remains in a legal limbo, caught between his app‚Äôs free-wheeling ethos and the tightening grip of government oversight.

  


# On The Horizon

Hey, shoppers! It‚Äôs time to check your economic vitals because tomorrow, the Conference Board is dropping its latest consumer confidence report. Think of it as a sneak peek into the collective mood of American wallets‚Äîare we feeling spendy or saving those pennies?

Here‚Äôs the scoop: Consumer spending powers about 70% of the US economy, so all eyes are on this report to see just how sturdy that spending spree is. Analysts are predicting a slight boost in confidence, with August‚Äôs index expected to climb to 101.8 from July‚Äôs 100.3. For context, any number over 90 usually signals a robust economy.¬†

Another thing to watch? Home-buying intentions. With mortgage rates cooling off a bit, will more people be house hunting? Last month, intentions hit a 12-year low, so any uptick could be a big deal.

# Powell Proclaims The Time Has Come‚Ä¶

Drumroll, please! Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell just dropped the mic at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, announcing the Fed‚Äôs plans to cut interest rates. Yup, the big pivot is here. After two years of cranking up rates to tame inflation, Powell is officially ready to start loosening the purse strings.

# Breaking Down the Big Shift

In what has to be the least surprising surprise of the year, Powell confirmed that rate cuts are coming soon, saying, ‚ÄúThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.‚Äù Translation? The Fed is done playing the inflation-fighting game and is now turning its attention to preventing a meltdown in the job market.

And Wall Street heard him loud and clear. Stocks jumped, with the Dow climbing over 400 points and the Nasdaq up by about 1.5%. Investors are stoked, Treasury yields are dipping, and everyone‚Äôs feeling a little lighter‚Äîexcept maybe those holding cash.

# So, What‚Äôs the Game Plan?

With inflation cooling off and the job market starting to look like a sad trombone, Powell‚Äôs got his eye on rate cuts. The big question now is: How much and how fast? The next Fed meeting in mid-September is shaping up to be a real cliffhanger. Will they go for a cautious quarter-point cut, or do they swing for the fences with a half-point slash?

As always, it‚Äôs all about the data. Powell didn‚Äôt spill all the beans, but he made it clear the Fed will be watching the numbers closely. A few more weak jobs reports, and we could see some serious rate-cutting action.

# What Does It Mean for You?

Well, if you‚Äôve been sweating those sky-high interest rates on your mortgage, auto loan, or credit card, there might be some relief on the horizon. But don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet‚ÄîPowell‚Äôs not exactly rushing to the finish line here. Rate cuts will likely be gradual, and the Fed‚Äôs going to take it slow and steady to avoid rocking the boat too much.

So, keep an eye on those economic reports, stay tuned for the next Fed move, and maybe start planning what you‚Äôll do with those extra dollars in your pocket. A new plant for the office? That fancy coffee machine? The possibilities are endless, but the rate cuts? Not so much. Let‚Äôs see how this one plays out!

# Polaris Dawn Mission Faces Brief Delay Before Historic Spacewalk

The Polaris Dawn mission, which is set to make history as the first space mission featuring a spacewalk conducted entirely by non-government astronauts, has been delayed by 24 hours. Originally slated for launch early Monday, the mission is now scheduled for liftoff on Tuesday at the earliest, according to SpaceX. This minor setback is all part of ensuring everything is perfect before this groundbreaking flight.

# What's the Plan?

Once it gets the green light, SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket will carry the all-civilian Polaris Dawn crew aboard the Dragon spacecraft to an altitude of 870 miles above Earth. This marks the highest any human has flown since the Apollo missions of the 1970s. The team will then descend to a cruising orbit about 435 miles above Earth, where they will spend five days conducting scientific experiments and testing new technologies, including a laser-based satellite communication system using SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink.

But the highlight of the mission will undoubtedly be the spacewalk, set to be the first-ever performed by private citizens. This ambitious feat will require the entire Dragon spacecraft to be depressurized, a risky maneuver given that the craft lacks an airlock. As a result, all four crew members, led by billionaire entrepreneur and mission commander Jared Isaacman, will don SpaceX‚Äôs new EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) suits and be tethered for safety as they venture into the vacuum of space.

# A Mission for the Books

This mission isn‚Äôt just about making history for the sake of it. The Polaris Dawn crew, which includes Isaacman, retired Air Force lieutenant colonel Scott ‚ÄúKidd‚Äù Poteet, and SpaceX engineers Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, aims to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight and gather valuable data for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. The team will navigate through the Van Allen radiation belts‚Äîregions of intense radiation that pose significant challenges for deep space exploration‚Äîwhile testing the limits of their new spacesuits.

Despite the slight delay, anticipation remains high for what could be one of the most significant milestones in the burgeoning era of commercial space exploration. As Isaacman and his crew prepare to take civilian space travel to new heights, the world will be watching closely, eager to see this next chapter in human spaceflight unfold.

# Powell at the Podium ‚Äî What to Expect from the Fed Chair‚Äôs Jackson Hole Speech

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is stepping up to the mic at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET. And while the setting might be picturesque, don‚Äôt get your hopes up for any earth-shattering news. Here‚Äôs what you can expect from Powell‚Äôs highly anticipated speech‚Äîand why it might be more of a snoozer than a showstopper.

# Rate Cuts Are Coming... Just Not Yet

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight: Wall Street‚Äôs already convinced that rate cuts are on the horizon. The smart money says the Fed‚Äôs going to start trimming rates in September and keep snipping away well into 2025. The real mystery is whether Powell will go for a cautious quarter-point cut or something bolder, like half a point. Most bets are on the former‚Äîunless the economy suddenly hits a rough patch in the next few weeks.

So, what‚Äôs Powell‚Äôs role in all this? He‚Äôs there to confirm the market‚Äôs expectations without spooking anyone. The theme of this year‚Äôs conference, ‚ÄúReassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,‚Äù is pretty much code for, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing it safe and sticking to the data.‚Äù Translation: Powell‚Äôs speech will likely be more of a recap than a revelation.

# Same Script, Different Year

This isn‚Äôt Powell‚Äôs first rodeo at Jackson Hole. Back in 2020, he used this same stage to roll out a new strategy that let inflation run hotter than usual, all in the name of promoting a more inclusive job market. Flash forward to now, and Powell‚Äôs likely to acknowledge the Fed‚Äôs progress in cooling down inflation while keeping an eye on a labor market that‚Äôs starting to show some cracks.

But if you‚Äôre expecting any major policy shifts, don‚Äôt hold your breath. Powell‚Äôs message will probably be something like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made progress, but we‚Äôre not out of the woods yet.‚Äù In other words, he‚Äôll hint that rate cuts are coming but won‚Äôt commit to specifics. After all, the Fed‚Äôs been preaching ‚Äúdata dependency‚Äù for months now, and that tune isn‚Äôt changing anytime soon.

So, while the backdrop at Jackson Hole will be as dramatic as ever, Powell‚Äôs speech? Not so much. Expect cautious optimism, a lot of ‚Äúwe‚Äôre watching the numbers,‚Äù and a gentle pat on the back for a job (mostly) well done. The markets might not get the fireworks they were hoping for, but hey, steady and predictable isn‚Äôt the worst thing in the world.

# Peloton‚Äôs Power Move: Biggest Rally Ever as Turnaround Takes Shape

Peloton ($PTON) just hit a major milestone‚Äîits biggest stock rally ever. After reporting earnings that blew past Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, shares of the at-home fitness giant surged 35%, closing at $4.55. Not too shabby for a company that‚Äôs been riding an emotional rollercoaster since the pandemic boom.

# Beating the Odds (and Estimates)

Peloton posted revenue of $644 million for the quarter ending June 30, a modest but meaningful uptick from last year and well above the $630 million analysts were bracing for. The company‚Äôs adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $70.3 million, flipping the script on last year‚Äôs $34.7 million loss and easily surpassing the $53.2 million analysts had forecasted.

So what‚Äôs behind the glow-up? Cost-cutting, baby. Peloton‚Äôs been trimming the fat‚Äîslashing expenses, cutting its workforce by 15%, and eking out $15 million in cost savings last quarter alone. The company is finally seeing green, not red, with a free cash flow of $26 million.

# The Ride Ahead: Smooth or Bumpy?

But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. Peloton‚Äôs forecast for the current quarter is a bit of a reality check. The company is predicting revenue between $560 million and $580 million‚Äîdown about 4% from last year and lower than analysts‚Äô expectations of $602 million. The subscriber base is also expected to shrink, with a 3% drop in users still sweating it out on Peloton hardware and a steeper 26% decline in paid app users.

And then there‚Äôs the search for a new CEO. With Barry McCarthy stepping down in May, Peloton‚Äôs leadership has been in a bit of limbo. Interim co-CEOs Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo are holding down the fort while the hunt for a new leader is ‚Äútop of mind for all stakeholders,‚Äù according to the company.

Despite the ups and downs, Peloton‚Äôs made it clear they‚Äôre in this for the long haul. The company acknowledges the road to recovery is still winding, especially with an unpredictable economy and the lingering question of whether people will stick with home workouts now that gyms are back in full swing.

So, while Peloton‚Äôs stock might be on a high right now, the real test will be whether they can keep the momentum going‚Äîor if this rally is just a quick burst of adrenaline.

This week‚Äôs headline event isn‚Äôt about the usual economic reports‚ÄîJerome Powell‚Äôs speech at Jackson Hole is stealing the spotlight.

Powell has been pretty guarded about his plans for monetary policy, so it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll drop any big hints about rate cuts before the Fed‚Äôs next meeting. But with the recent revision of 818K Jobs in nonfarm payroll data, investors are hungry for insights on the job market‚Äîsomething Powell might need to address if he wants to avoid triggering a market slide.

# Fed Flirts with a Rate Cut

The latest Fed minutes have everyone buzzing: Several officials hinted that a rate cut was on the table during their July meeting, but they ultimately decided to keep things steady. With inflation cooling off and unemployment edging higher, the Fed is now eyeing September as the likely time to hit the rate cut button. The central bank‚Äôs benchmark rate is sitting at a 23-year high, but the consensus is building that the economy might need a little relief sooner rather than later.

# The Inflation-Labor Market Tug-of-War

It‚Äôs a balancing act over at the Fed. On one side, inflation is showing signs of backing down, which is music to the ears of policymakers. On the other, the labor market is starting to look a bit shaky, with some Fed members worried that a slow-down in job growth could snowball into something more serious. The debate inside the Fed is shifting, with more focus on managing risks to the job market while keeping a watchful eye on inflation. The big takeaway? If the numbers keep trending the way they are, a rate cut in September seems almost inevitable.

# Markets Place Their Bets

Wall Street is already betting big on a September rate cut, and the Fed‚Äôs minutes have only fueled the fire. Futures markets are pricing in the first rate cut since the pandemic‚Äôs early days, and investors are gearing up for what could be a major shift in monetary policy. But it‚Äôs not all smooth sailing‚Äîthere‚Äôs some political tension brewing. A rate cut so close to the presidential election could stir up controversy, especially since former President Trump has already voiced his opinion against it. On the flip side, some Democratic senators are pushing for the Fed to cut sooner, arguing that waiting too long could be just as politically charged.

Recent economic data has been a mixed bag, adding to the Fed‚Äôs conundrum. The July jobs report was weaker than expected, with hiring slowing down and unemployment ticking up to 4.3%. To make matters worse, a revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that payroll growth over the past year might have been overstated by over 800,000 jobs (more on this below). This paints a less rosy picture of the labor market, suggesting that it‚Äôs been cooling off for longer than anyone realized. At the same time, inflation seems to be easing off, giving the Fed some breathing room to consider easing up on rates.

# All Eyes on Jackson Hole

The Fed‚Äôs next move could set the tone for the economy as we head into the final stretch of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to speak at the Jackson Hole symposium, and his words will be under the microscope as markets and analysts try to decipher the Fed‚Äôs next steps. With a rate cut looking more and more likely, the focus will be on how quickly the Fed plans to ease up on rates and what that means for the broader economic outlook. Will the Fed go for a modest cut in September, or could we see something more aggressive? Stay tuned‚Äîthe stakes are high, and the markets are watching closely.

* Walmart Inc. ($WMT) raised about $3.6 billion by selling its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD. com ($JD), winding down an eight-year partnership that appears to be paying diminishing returns amid a challenging landscape for Chinese tech giants.

# Jobs Growth? Not So Fast

Turns out the labor market wasn‚Äôt as hot as we thought. The Bureau of Labor Statistics just revised down its previous nonfarm payroll growth estimates by a whopping 818,000 jobs for the year ending in March. That‚Äôs nearly a million fewer jobs than initially reported, translating to a 30% cut from the original numbers. Yikes! So much for that robust job market everyone was touting.

# The Reality Check

Initially, the BLS reported an average gain of 242,000 jobs per month during that period. Now, the revised figures suggest it was closer to 174,000‚Äîstill decent, but far less than what was expected. The biggest downward revisions hit sectors like professional and business services, hospitality, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, a few areas, such as private education, health services, and transportation, actually saw slight upward revisions. Overall, though, this marks the steepest revision since the financial crisis in 2009, signaling that the cracks in the labor market may have been forming much earlier than anyone realized.

This labor market revision throws another wrench into the Federal Reserve‚Äôs plans. With the job market cooling faster than expected, the pressure is mounting on the Fed to cut interest rates, and soon. Traders are already betting on a rate cut in September, with some even eyeing a half-point reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to address this at the Jackson Hole symposium, where all eyes will be on how the Fed plans to navigate this new data while trying to keep the economy on track.

# What It Means for the Economy

So, what‚Äôs the big picture? While the labor market is lagging, other parts of the economy, like consumer spending, are holding up better than expected. That might be why markets didn‚Äôt freak out today, with stocks staying in the green despite the job market bombshell. Economists weren‚Äôt entirely caught off guard, especially after the unemployment rate nudged up to 4.3% in July. But the new figures underscore the challenges ahead for Powell and his team as they weigh the risks of inflation against a softening labor market.

# Looking Ahead

These revised job numbers are still preliminary, with final revisions expected early next year‚Äîlong after the Fed has likely made its rate decisions. But for now, the takeaway is clear: The labor market isn‚Äôt as strong as it seemed, and the Fed‚Äôs task just got slightly trickier. As Powell and other central bankers prepare to meet at Jackson Hole, they‚Äôll need to rethink their strategy to balance a cooling job market with the broader economic outlook.



# Snowflake‚Äôs AI Buzz Falls Flat

# By the Numbers:

* **Revenue:**¬†$868.8 million (up 29% YoY)
* **Adjusted EPS:**¬†$0.18 per share (beat estimates of $0.16)
* **Net Loss:**¬†$317.77 million (or $0.95 per share)
* **Product Revenue:**¬†$829 million (up 30% YoY)

Snowflake Inc. tried to win over investors with its latest sales outlook, but the results didn‚Äôt exactly dazzle. Despite launching new AI-focused products, the company‚Äôs projections for the upcoming quarter came in below some of the more optimistic expectations, leaving investors unimpressed. Shares took a 7% dive in extended trading, capping off a rough year where the stock has already dropped 32%.

# Growing Pains

Under the leadership of new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, Snowflake has been busy rolling out tools aimed at the booming AI market. But the company is facing stiff competition from heavyweights like Databricks and Microsoft, and the pressure is starting to show. In the fiscal second quarter, Snowflake‚Äôs revenue grew by 29% to $868.8 million, marking the first time the company‚Äôs growth dipped below 30% since going public. And while product revenue increased by 30% to $829 million, it wasn‚Äôt enough to ease concerns about the company‚Äôs ability to keep pace in the AI race.

Snowflake did manage to raise its full-year product sales forecast to $3.36 billion, up from $3.3 billion, which sounds like good news‚Äîuntil you consider that some analysts had been hoping for even higher numbers. Meanwhile, the company‚Äôs net loss widened to $317.77 million, or $0.95 per share, significantly missing expectations. On the bright side, Snowflake added 1,000 new employees over the past year and now has 510 customers spending over $1 million annually.

# The Security Snafu

Adding to Snowflake‚Äôs woes, the company has been dealing with the fallout from a hacking incident that compromised client accounts, including big names like AT&T and Ticketmaster. While Snowflake insists its own systems weren‚Äôt breached, the negative headlines have done little to help investor sentiment. CEO Ramaswamy acknowledged the challenges, stating, ‚ÄúWe obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter,‚Äù but emphasized that the issue wasn‚Äôt on Snowflake‚Äôs end.

# The Road Ahead

Snowflake is clearly betting big on AI, but the road ahead is far from smooth. With tough competition, widening losses, and lingering security concerns, the company has a lot to prove. Investors are eagerly waiting to see if Snowflake can leverage its new AI products to regain momentum, but for now, the outlook remains cautious. As Ramaswamy pointed out, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúhuge opportunity‚Äù ahead, but it‚Äôs going to take more than just buzzwords to calm investors‚Äô nerves.

# Breaking Up Google? DOJ Considers a Historic Move

Google ($GOOGL) has long reigned supreme with its trifecta of Search, Android, and YouTube, but its days of unchecked dominance might be numbered. After a federal court ruled that Google‚Äôs been playing monopoly with the internet search market, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is considering some drastic measures that could permanently alter Google‚Äôs empire‚Äîand send shockwaves through Big Tech.

# Google‚Äôs Breakup Drama

For the first time in over 20 years, the DOJ is mulling over the breakup of a major tech company, and Google‚Äôs in the crosshairs. This isn‚Äôt just a slap on the wrist; the DOJ is reportedly considering forcing Google to shed some of its most profitable assets. Imagine Google Ads‚Äîresponsible for a staggering $238 billion in 2023‚Äîbeing spun off into a separate entity. That‚Äôs just one option on the table. Another scenario could see Google being forced to sell off its Android operating system or Chrome browser, two products that are practically synonymous with the internet itself. The potential breakup could not only reshape Google but could also set a new precedent for regulating other tech giants.

# Flashback to Microsoft‚Äôs 2000 Antitrust Battle

If this all sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because we‚Äôve seen something like this before. Back in 2000, the DOJ went after Microsoft for its near-total control over the PC market. While the attempt to break up Microsoft was eventually overturned on appeal, the case did lead to restrictions that slowed down the tech giant‚Äôs dominance just enough to allow new players‚Äîlike Google‚Äîto rise. Now, Google might find itself in a similar position. The DOJ could impose rules that force Google to share its valuable data and technology with competitors or ban it from entering exclusive contracts that keep rivals at bay. Case in point: Google‚Äôs $26 billion splurge to secure default search engine status on iPhones and Firefox. These kinds of practices could soon be a thing of the past.

# Silicon Valley on High Alert

While Google is currently the star of this antitrust drama, every other tech behemoth‚Äîfrom Amazon to Apple to Meta‚Äîis watching with bated breath. The outcome of Google‚Äôs case could have far-reaching consequences, especially as these companies face their own antitrust challenges. A decision to break up Google could embolden regulators to take a tougher stance across the board, fundamentally altering the landscape of the tech industry. The DOJ is set to reveal its proposed remedies in September, and until then, all of Silicon Valley is on edge, knowing that the stakes have never been higher.

# Walmart Q2 Surge: Higher Sales, Raised Outlook

# By the Numbers:

* **Revenue:**¬†$169.34 billion (vs. $168.46 billion expected)
* **Adjusted EPS:**¬†$0.67 (vs. $0.65 expected)
* **US Same-Store Sales Growth:**¬†4.2%
* **E-Commerce Growth:**¬†22% in the U.S.
* **Full-Year Sales Guidance:**¬†3.75% to 4.75%

# Walmart‚Äôs Winning Streak

Walmart ($WMT) just dropped some numbers, and it looks like they're riding high on the wave of deal-seeking shoppers. The retail giant raised its full-year sales outlook, now predicting a rise of up to 4.75%, a bump from its previous cap of 4%. Thanks to a growing number of customers‚Äîespecially those from higher-income brackets‚Äîscouring for bargains, Walmart's stock surged today, marking its biggest intraday gain since late 2022.

The real juice? E-commerce sales in the U.S. shot up by 22%, largely driven by pickups and Walmart‚Äôs third-party marketplace. This growth wasn‚Äôt just in the grocery aisles either; after 11 quarters of decline, general merchandise sales finally showed some life. Seasonal items like pool noodles were particularly popular‚Äîso much so that you could stretch all the noodles sold across 30,000 football fields. That‚Äôs a lot of backyard fun.

# Cautious Optimism Amid Economic Uncertainty

Walmart‚Äôs success contrasts sharply with other retailers like Home Depot ($HD) and Whirlpool ($WHR), which have been struggling as consumers put off big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, Walmart continues to rake in customers across all income levels, including a significant chunk from wealthier households hunting for deals.

With the back-to-school season off to a strong start and inflationary pressures easing a bit, Walmart‚Äôs cautious optimism about the rest of the year seems well-placed. The retailer is focusing on keeping prices down, pushing suppliers to do the same, and expanding its high-margin businesses like advertising and membership programs. And with more shoppers tightening their belts and opting for at-home dining over takeout, Walmart‚Äôs grocery dominance is likely to continue driving growth.

# CPI Just¬†Dropped‚Ä¶

Inflation? More like deflation. The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report just hit, and it‚Äôs giving us the kind of cautiously optimistic vibes you get when something unexpectedly goes right‚Äîlike a pleasant surprise, but with a side of skepticism, because you're waiting to see if it‚Äôs too good to be true.

# What You Need to Know:

* **Core CPI**¬†(AKA inflation minus the wildcards like food and energy) rose 3.2% year-over-year‚Äîits chillest pace since early 2021. On a monthly basis, it edged up 0.2%, barely more than a rounding error compared to June‚Äôs numbers.
* **Overall inflation**¬†bumped up 0.2% for the month and 2.9% from last year‚Äîa number we haven‚Äôt seen since early 2021. Nearly 90% of that monthly increase is thanks to shelter costs, which are doing their best to keep inflation from becoming too boring.
* **As for the Fed?**¬†They‚Äôre still eyeing rate cuts like a kid in a candy store. Futures traders are betting on a full percentage point of cuts by year‚Äôs end, but a hefty 50-basis-point chop in September is looking less likely.

**The Housing Dilemma:**¬†Shelter costs are like that one guest who won‚Äôt leave the party. They were responsible for nearly all of July‚Äôs inflation bump, with the shelter index rising 0.4% after June‚Äôs 0.2% uptick. Meanwhile, car insurance costs soared 1.2%, and food prices edged up 0.2%. But hey, energy prices, new cars, clothes, and airfares all decided to give your wallet a break.

**Market Vibes:**¬†Wall Street barely flinched. Stock futures nudged upward, and Treasury yields inched higher. The yield curve flattened, suggesting the markets are still waiting to see if the Fed will play the role of Santa or the Grinch come September.

So, what‚Äôs next? Rate cuts are almost a done deal, but whether it‚Äôs a gentle 25-basis-point trim or a bold 50-pointer is still up in the air. Pro tip: If you‚Äôve got cash parked in high-yield accounts, you might want to lock in those rates now before they start shrinking faster than summer vacation.

# Mars To Acquire Kellanova for $36 Billion in Snack Power Play

# A Bold Bite

Mars Inc., the king of candy with a portfolio that includes M&M‚Äôs and Snickers, is making its biggest move in nearly a decade by acquiring Kellanova, the snack behemoth behind Pringles and Cheez-Its, for a jaw-dropping $36 billion. This blockbuster deal prices Kellanova at $83.50 per share‚Äîa hefty 33% premium over its August 2nd stock price. Mars is clearly betting big on the future of snacking, and it‚Äôs not just about satisfying cravings. With cocoa prices skyrocketing, Mars is looking to diversify away from its chocolate-heavy lineup.

# Snacking Strategy: Go Big or Go Home

Kellanova, which split from Kellogg ($K) last year, has been on a winning streak, outperforming rivals and enjoying a 33% surge in stock value this year alone. With its impressive portfolio of globally recognized brands and a strong presence in emerging markets, Kellanova is the perfect snack-sized addition to Mars‚Äô empire. Mars plans to double its snacking business over the next decade, leveraging Kellanova‚Äôs strength in regions like Africa while boosting its own presence in China. And don't worry, your favorite snacks like Cheez-Its and Pringles aren‚Äôt going anywhere‚ÄîMars has no plans to shake up the lineup.

# The Regulatory Maze

Now, about those potential roadblocks: While a deal of this magnitude usually sets off antitrust alarm bells, both Mars and Kellanova are confident they‚Äôll navigate the regulatory landscape with ease. The two companies have minimal overlap, which should help them avoid any major pushback. But if things don‚Äôt go as planned, Mars could be on the hook for a $1.25 billion breakup fee‚Äîa bitter pill to swallow. Still, analysts believe the deal will likely go through, setting the stage for more mergers and acquisitions in the snack industry as companies scramble to keep up with changing consumer tastes and the push for global expansion.

This acquisition isn‚Äôt just about adding a few more snacks to Mars‚Äô pantry‚Äîit‚Äôs about reshaping the future of the industry and staking a claim in the global market. As the saying goes, if you can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem, buy ‚Äòem.

  


# Cisco Slashes 7% of Workforce, but Earnings Surprise on the Upside

# By the Numbers:

Here‚Äôs the lowdown on Cisco‚Äôs latest quarterly report and restructuring moves:

* **Layoffs:**¬†7% of global staff (around 6,000 jobs)
* **Earnings:**¬†$0.87 per share (beating $0.85 expected)
* **Revenue:**¬†$13.64 billion (vs. $13.54 billion predicted)
* **Networking Revenue:**¬†Down 28% to $6.8 billion
* **Security Revenue:**¬†Up 81% to $1.8 billion
* **Splunk‚Äôs Impact:**¬†$960 million in revenue
* **Net Income:**¬†Down 45% to $2.2 billion
* **Stock:**¬†Down 10% YTD, but up 5.5% after hours

# The Layoff Shuffle

Cisco ($CSCO) is tightening its belt again, cutting 7% of its global workforce‚Äîabout 6,000 jobs‚Äîin a bid to save $1 billion. This is the second major round of layoffs for the tech giant this year, following a 5% reduction back in February. So why the cuts? Cisco says it‚Äôs all about redirecting resources to ‚Äúkey growth opportunities‚Äù and making the business more efficient. In plain English, it‚Äôs time to trim the fat and focus on what‚Äôs actually working as the company navigates some choppy waters.

# Revenue Down, but Not Out

Despite reporting its third straight quarter of declining revenue, Cisco managed to beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations. The company posted earnings of $0.87 per share, edging out the expected $0.85, while revenue came in slightly above forecasts at $13.64 billion. However, it‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows‚ÄîCisco‚Äôs bread-and-butter networking business is taking a hit, with revenue from switches and routers plummeting 28%. The ongoing shift of large enterprises to cloud services is eroding demand for Cisco‚Äôs traditional hardware, leaving the company scrambling to adapt.

# Splunk to the Rescue

Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. Cisco‚Äôs $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, a major player in data analytics and cybersecurity, is starting to pay off. The security segment saw an 81% surge in revenue, thanks in large part to Splunk, which contributed $960 million this quarter alone. As Cisco‚Äôs hardware sales continue to struggle, the company‚Äôs future seems increasingly tied to software and security. And the market seems to agree‚ÄîCisco‚Äôs stock popped 5.5% in after-hours trading, even though it‚Äôs still down 10% for the year.

Looking ahead, Cisco‚Äôs revenue slide isn‚Äôt expected to turn around overnight, but the company‚Äôs pivot toward more stable, subscription-based revenue through software and security could be its saving grace. For now, it‚Äôs all about weathering the storm and hoping that Splunk‚Äôs boost is enough to keep the ship afloat.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

This week still has a few reports left on the docket, but after today‚Äôs big CPI drop, the rest seem a bit underwhelming.

One key metric to keep an eye on is US retail sales, which are expected to tick up by about 0.3% for July. Retail sales have held up surprisingly well despite high inflation, helping the US dodge a recession so far. But if the job market is showing more cracks than expected, consumer spending could take a hit‚Äîand this report might reflect that shift.

We‚Äôll also get updates from the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, the Philly Fed Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, and the Import Price Index (think of it as the quirky cousin of CPI and PPI).

# Before Market Open:

* **Walmart**¬†($WMT), the nation‚Äôs retail giant, just keeps getting bigger. The company‚Äôs making serious moves in e-commerce and is planning to integrate AI across its supply chain. Add to that steady growth at Sam‚Äôs Club and solid margins despite inflation, and it‚Äôs easy to see why 27 of 30 Wall Street analysts have Walmart as a buy. The consensus: $0.64 EPS and $168.57 billion in revenue.
* **Alibaba**¬†($BABA), often dubbed China‚Äôs Amazon, hasn‚Äôt seen much stock movement this year. Investors are eager to hear how the company plans to navigate China‚Äôs ongoing economic slowdown and explore growth opportunities abroad. If Alibaba delivers the right message, its current low valuation could set the stage for a significant rally. The consensus: $2.11 EPS and $34.46 billion in revenue.",08-15-2024

# Starbucks Taps Chipotle CEO to Brew Up a Turnaround

Starbucks ($SBUX) just swapped out its CEO like a barista switching out coffee beans. Laxman Narasimhan is out, and Brian Niccol, the former Chipotle ($CMG) chief, is in. Investors responded like they‚Äôd just had a double shot of espresso‚Äîsending Starbucks stock up a whopping 24.5%.

# From Burrito Bowls to Coffee Cups

Niccol is no stranger to turning things around. At Chipotle, he led a massive comeback after the food-safety scandals, transforming the burrito chain into a digital ordering powerhouse and boosting its stock by about 800%. Now, he‚Äôs trading guac for frappuccinos, with the challenge of revamping Starbucks‚Äô sluggish sales and clunky operations.

# Brewing Up Big Changes

Starbucks has been struggling with long wait times and fewer customers, especially as inflation bites into coffee budgets. Narasimhan tried to caffeinate the company‚Äôs sales with higher-priced drinks and digital orders, but it backfired, leading to his abrupt exit.¬†Enter Niccol, who‚Äôs expected to bring some of his Chipotle magic‚Äîthink streamlined operations and a revamped digital experience that makes ordering and picking up your coffee as effortless as grabbing lunch on the go.

But it‚Äôs not all smooth sipping ahead. Niccol‚Äôs got to juggle the demands of activist investor Elliott Management and Starbucks‚Äô not-so-retired founder, Howard Schultz, who‚Äôs still lingering like the smell of burnt coffee beans. His mission? To deliver on some more realistic goals, unlike the lofty ones Schultz set, which sent Narasimhan packing.

# Chipotle‚Äôs Loss, Starbucks‚Äô Gain

Meanwhile, Chipotle‚Äôs stock took a hit, dropping 7.5% on fears that Niccol‚Äôs departure could shake up the burrito biz. But analysts are confident that the team Niccol built will keep Chipotle rolling.

So, should you bet on Starbucks? Wall Street seems to think so, with analysts upgrading their ratings faster than a barista pumps out pumpkin spice lattes. Niccol‚Äôs got the skills to grind out a Starbucks revival, but he‚Äôs got a tall order ahead. Stay tuned‚Äîit‚Äôs going to be a wild brew.

Here‚Äôs why it matters: If CPI plays nice and comes in as predicted, it could be the green light for the Fed to start cutting interest rates, something Wall Street has been anxiously waiting for. The Fed has been in inflation-fighting mode for what feels like forever, but with the unemployment rate creeping up, there‚Äôs growing pressure for them to pivot. Jim Baird, Chief Investment Officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, put it simply: ‚ÄúInflation is almost a nonissue at this point. There‚Äôs this broad expectation that the worst is easily behind us.‚Äù

But don‚Äôt pop the champagne just yet. If CPI surprises us by coming in hotter than expected, it could throw a wrench in the works and reignite those dreaded stagflation fears‚Äîa combo of rising prices and slowing economic growth that‚Äôs basically the financial equivalent of a horror movie. While some experts think stagflation fears are overblown, a surprise in the CPI could still send markets into a tailspin and force the Fed to rethink its next move.

# The Fed‚Äôs Next Move: Rate Cuts or More Tightening?

So, what‚Äôs at stake? A lot. Markets are already pricing in a rate cut at the Fed‚Äôs September meeting, but tomorrow‚Äôs CPI report could either seal the deal or flip the script. If inflation stays on the down-low, the Fed might finally be able to take its foot off the gas. But if prices start heating up again, well, we might be in for a bumpy ride.



# Home Depot‚Äôs Reality Check: Deferral Mode Activated

# üõ†Ô∏è¬†By the Numbers:

* **Comparable Sales:**¬†Down 3.3% (7th consecutive quarterly decline)
* **Revenue:**¬†$43.18 billion (vs. $43.06 billion expected)
* **Earnings per Share:**¬†$4.67 (vs. $4.52 expected)
* **Outlook:**¬†Sales now expected to drop 3-4% this year (previously forecasted 1% decline)

Home Depot ($HD) is feeling the squeeze as consumers tighten their tool belts. Despite beating Wall Street‚Äôs expectations for earnings and revenue, the home improvement titan had to cut its full-year sales forecast, blaming a ‚Äúdeferral mindset‚Äù among customers who are holding off on major projects until interest rates stop giving them heartburn. It turns out, people aren‚Äôt as eager to remodel their kitchens when borrowing costs are sky-high.

# Seven Quarters of Slumps‚ÄîAnd Counting

Let‚Äôs talk numbers. Home Depot‚Äôs comparable sales have dipped for the seventh straight quarter, with a 3.3% decline this time around. Blame it on consumers who are spending less and waiting more. While pandemic lockdowns had everyone rushing to Home Depot to spruce up their spaces, today‚Äôs economic uncertainty has them second-guessing that new deck or bathroom redo. Instead, they‚Äôre opting for smaller, wallet-friendly projects‚Äîlike painting a wall instead of tearing it down.

# Betting Big on the Long Game

But it‚Äôs not all doom and gloom. Home Depot is playing the long game, investing in its professional customer base and digital capabilities to weather the storm. The recent $18 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution, a supplier to professional contractors, is a big move in that direction. These pros are less likely to delay projects, making them a more reliable revenue stream. Plus, with investments in supply chain and digital infrastructure, Home Depot is setting itself up for future growth once the economy gets its groove back.

So, while the immediate future might look a little shaky, Home Depot is banking on a rebound‚Äîwhenever that might be. In the meantime, they‚Äôll keep hammering away at those long-term strategies.



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Tomorrow, the spotlight shifts to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the big brother of today‚Äôs Producer Price Index (PPI) report.

CPI tracks the price changes of goods and services that hit your wallet directly. It‚Äôs a crucial gauge for the Federal Reserve as they monitor how their battle against inflation is shaping up. In June 2024, CPI climbed 3% year-over-year, following a 3.3% rise in May. For July, economists are betting on another 3% annual hike with a modest 0.2% increase from June.

Given the market‚Äôs volatility, a higher-than-expected CPI could trigger a wave of selling, while a lower number might spark investor enthusiasm, inching us closer to the Fed dialing back interest rates.

# Tesla Cybertruck Now Starts at $100K After Dropping Cheapest Model

Tesla ($TSLA) just gave the Cybertruck's price tag a serious jolt‚Äîif you were holding out for the ""affordable"" $60,990 model, you're out of luck. Tesla quietly pulled that version from its lineup, leaving the cheapest Cybertruck at a jaw-dropping $99,990. That‚Äôs a $39,000 leap from where the price floor used to be.

# The Price of Progress?

But wait, there‚Äôs more. The tri-motor Cyberbeast, the souped-up version that puts your foot to the floor with more torque and speed, now costs $119,990. That‚Äôs a $20K hike from just a week ago. Remember when Elon Musk promised a $39,990 Cybertruck back in 2019? Ah, simpler times. With the base model gone, it looks like Tesla is banking on buyers with deeper pockets and a taste for luxury‚Äîbecause clearly, the entry-level market isn‚Äôt a priority anymore.

# Fast Deliveries or Slowing Demand?

Tesla claims it‚Äôs speeding up delivery times, with AWD models potentially arriving as early as this month. But don‚Äôt let the expedited shipping fool you‚Äîthese price hikes might just be a sign that demand is cooling off faster than Musk anticipated. After all, how many folks are really ready to shell out six figures for a truck that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi flick?

Meanwhile, Cybertruck's bumpy road continues with recalls, sinking profits in Tesla's latest quarter, and a flurry of federal investigations. The dream of an affordable, mass-market EV truck seems further away than ever. Plus, faster deliveries could signal that Tesla's inventory is growing‚Äîa red flag that maybe, just maybe, those million pre-orders aren‚Äôt translating into actual sales. So, while Tesla might be speeding up production, it could also be facing the reality that a $100K truck isn‚Äôt exactly a hot commodity. But hey, if you‚Äôve got $100K burning a hole in your pocket, Tesla‚Äôs got just the truck for you.

# Trump Returns to X, $DJT Stock Takes a Hit

Donald Trump is back on X (formerly Twitter), and his reappearance is already shaking things up. Just ahead of a highly anticipated interview with Elon Musk, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) dipped 5%. The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET, marks Trump‚Äôs first major return to the platform since August 2023. The question on everyone‚Äôs mind: What does this mean for Trump‚Äôs own social media platform, Truth Social?

# X Marks the Spot

Trump‚Äôs return to X is a big deal‚Äîafter all, this is the platform that played a huge role in his political rise. But there‚Äôs a twist. Trump previously vowed to stick to his own platform, Truth Social, after being banned from major social media sites. His comeback to X might signal a shift in strategy, especially with the 2024 election looming. And let‚Äôs not forget, this move comes after Musk‚Äôs recent endorsement of Trump, despite their very public beef just a couple of years ago.

# Stocks Stumble as the Spotlight Shifts

Trump‚Äôs return to X isn‚Äôt just about tweets‚Äîit‚Äôs affecting his wallet, too. Shares of Trump Media took a hit, dropping 5% on Monday. Investors seem to be questioning whether Trump‚Äôs renewed presence on X could spell trouble for Truth Social. After all, why would Trump‚Äôs followers stick around on his platform if he‚Äôs back to tweeting up a storm on X?

The timing couldn‚Äôt be more critical. Trump Media has been struggling financially, reporting a net loss of $16.4 million in the second quarter. With stocks already down nearly 50% since its public debut, the pressure is on.¬†



# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

Investors are bracing for a pivotal week of inflation data, with the Producer Price Index (PPI) report dropping on Tuesday, followed by the highly anticipated Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday. Economists are forecasting a slight slowdown in July‚Äôs PPI, expecting a 0.1% monthly increase compared to June‚Äôs 0.2%. This could be an early indicator that inflation pressures on producers are easing, which might bring some optimism to the markets ahead of the CPI release.

As it stands, there‚Äôs a nearly even split among investors on whether the Federal Reserve will opt for a 50-basis-point rate cut in September, with current odds at 48%, down from 52% just a short time ago. All eyes are on these reports as they could heavily influence the Fed's next steps and the market's direction.

# Anduril‚Äôs $14B Game Plan: Autonomous Weapons Factories

The defense tech startup Anduril Industries, famous for being named after a fictional sword¬†used by¬†The Lord of the Rings¬†character Aragorn,¬†and founded by Oculus teen prodigy Palmer Luckey, just secured a cool $1.5 billion in new funding. This brings its valuation to a jaw-dropping $14 billion, just seven years after it launched. And what‚Äôs on their shopping list with all that cash? Autonomous weapons factories, because why build a regular factory when you can build one that churns out high-tech war machines like it‚Äôs no big deal?

# Cracking the Government Code

Anduril has quickly climbed the ranks to become a serious contender in the defense world, a sector where newcomers rarely survive, let alone thrive. The company has somehow cracked the government contract code by consistently delivering on time, on budget, and with tech that‚Äôs making the old guard sweat. They recently outmaneuvered giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing to snag a contract with the U.S. Air Force for developing uncrewed fighter jet prototypes. So yeah, Anduril is playing with the big boys now.

# Meet Arsenal-1: The Mega Weapons Factory

Now, let‚Äôs talk about Arsenal-1, Anduril‚Äôs planned 5-million-square-foot megafactory. This isn‚Äôt your average assembly line. Think of it as the Willy Wonka factory of autonomous military systems. The plan? Produce tens of thousands of these systems annually, with a workforce that could number in the thousands. Anduril‚Äôs Chief Strategy Officer, Chris Brose, says Arsenal-1 is just the start‚Äîthey‚Äôre already eyeing additional locations, including one abroad. The goal is to scale defense production in a way the industry hasn‚Äôt seen in decades, potentially saving the day when global conflicts demand rapid resupply.

# Why It Matters

The timing couldn‚Äôt be more critical. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has highlighted a glaring issue: the U.S. and its allies don‚Äôt have enough military equipment stockpiled for a prolonged conflict. Anduril‚Äôs ambitious plans to ramp up production are designed to address this shortfall. As Brose put it bluntly, ""America and our allies don‚Äôt have enough stuff."" With a global stage set for potential conflicts, investors are betting big on Anduril‚Äôs ability to deliver.

# What‚Äôs Next?

Expect Anduril to keep scaling, with the $1.5 billion war chest enabling them to expand their manufacturing capabilities and continue developing cutting-edge defense tech. The investors behind this latest funding round‚Äîincluding Sands Capital and Founders Fund‚Äîare clearly convinced that Anduril is the next big thing in defense. They‚Äôre not just throwing cash at a flashy startup; they‚Äôre betting on Anduril to reshape the future of military production. And with Arsenal-1 on the horizon, Anduril seems ready to do just that.

# Costco Cracks Down: Membership Scanners Coming to All Stores

Heads up, Costco ($COST) fans‚Äîyour days of sneaking into the warehouse without a membership card are officially numbered. Costco announced it's rolling out membership scanners at the entrances of all its locations. Over the coming months, instead of casually flashing your card at the door, you‚Äôll need to scan it, whether it‚Äôs physical or digital. And don‚Äôt even think about borrowing mom‚Äôs card for that sweet rotisserie chicken‚ÄîCostco‚Äôs tightening up its security.

# Card Sharing Crackdown

So, what‚Äôs behind this crackdown? Costco‚Äôs CFO Richard Galanti mentioned that since the pandemic, more people have been trying to sneak in using someone else‚Äôs membership. Not cool, folks. Costco isn‚Äôt playing games anymore. They‚Äôve already started testing these scanners earlier this year, and the results have them feeling confident about rolling them out nationwide.

This move isn‚Äôt just about keeping non-members out‚Äîit‚Äôs also about speeding things up inside. By scanning at the entrance, there‚Äôs no need for employees to check cards at registers or self-checkout, meaning a quicker in-and-out for everyone.

# Membership Fees: The Real Money Maker

Why is Costco so serious about memberships? Because that‚Äôs where the big bucks come from. Last year alone, Costco raked in $4.6 billion from membership fees. These fees are crucial to Costco‚Äôs profits, and with nearly 128 million members, the warehouse giant has a lot to protect. Starting September 1, those fees are going up for the first time since 2017. The basic Gold Star membership will rise from $60 to $65, while the Executive Membership jumps from $120 to $130. Plus, the maximum 2% reward for Executive members will increase to $1,250 from $1,000.

# What It Means for You

If you‚Äôre a member, make sure to bring your card‚Äîand a photo ID if your membership doesn‚Äôt include a picture‚Äîevery time you visit. Guests? They‚Äôll still need to be accompanied by a member to get in. This move is Costco‚Äôs latest effort to ensure that only paying members enjoy the perks, like that famous $1.50 hot dog combo.

So next time you‚Äôre headed to Costco, don‚Äôt forget your card. With these new scanners, Costco is serious about keeping its benefits exclusive‚Äîand its lines moving faster.

# Is It Safe to Breathe Again, Investors?

If your inbox was flooded yesterday with anxious messages from friends fretting over their stock portfolios or colleagues worried about their 401(k)s, you weren‚Äôt the only one.

# Is the Storm Over?

Monday's market madness had investors around the globe in a frenzy, thanks to a perfect storm of economic jitters. The chaos started with unsettling employment data hinting that the Fed‚Äôs efforts to cool the economy might be working too well. Add to that a massive unwind of a popular carry trade in Japan and some AI-related profit-taking, and you had a recipe for a sea of red in the markets.

But just as quickly as the losses came, they started to fade. Tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft, which were among the biggest losers yesterday, have already bounced back into positive territory.

# Staying Steady in Unsteady Times

So, is the storm over? Not so fast. While yesterday's selloff seemed more about fear than fundamentals, the broader economic landscape remains shaky. The Fed hasn‚Äôt budged on interest rates yet, despite growing speculation that they‚Äôll roll out a hefty rate cut in September to calm things down.

Wall Street pros are warning that we‚Äôre likely in for more turbulence before any rate cuts materialize. And though a half-point cut seems to be the consensus, these are the same folks who predicted six rate cuts at the start of the year‚Äîso take their forecasts with a grain of salt.

# The Takeaway?

Don‚Äôt let market swings scare you into cashing out. Analysts stress that volatility is no reason to hit the eject button, especially after the strong gains we've seen this year. A little bumpiness is par for the course.

And if we‚Äôre not at the market‚Äôs bottom yet, this might just be the chance to buy into sectors like AI, which have been sky-high in recent months.

In short, hang tight and keep your cool.There are plenty of other things to lose sleep over, like whether your favorite streaming service is about to hike prices again or why that meme stock you bought for fun is suddenly your biggest holding.

# Google Gets the Monopoly Hammer: What‚Äôs Next?

# The Verdict Is In

In a ruling that could shake up the tech world, a federal judge has declared that Google ($GOOGL) is, indeed, an illegal monopoly. Judge Amit Mehta didn‚Äôt mince words, stating, ‚ÄúGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.‚Äù This is a major win for the Department of Justice, which has been chasing Google for years, accusing the tech giant of smothering competition in search and advertising.

But hold your horses‚Äîthis is just the beginning. The next phase will decide what happens to Google. Will it be slapped on the wrist with a fine, or could it face a breakup? While the latter sounds juicy, it‚Äôs probably not going to happen. Google‚Äôs appealing the ruling, so this could drag out longer than your latest Netflix binge.

# Big Tech's Turn in the Hot Seat

Google isn‚Äôt the only tech giant sweating right now. Amazon ($AMZN), Apple ($AAPL), and Meta ($META) are all facing similar antitrust scrutiny. Regulators argue that these companies have been acting like playground bullies, pushing around smaller rivals and favoring their own products. The Google ruling could set the stage for how these cases unfold, but whether it‚Äôll lead to actual change remains to be seen.

# Investors Hit Snooze

While the ruling is big news, investors don‚Äôt seem too concerned. Alphabet‚Äôs stock dipped a bit with the rest of the market but quickly bounced back. Analysts like Wedbush‚Äôs Dan Ives aren‚Äôt expecting any major disruptions to Google‚Äôs operations in the near term, so it looks like business as usual‚Äîfor now.

So, what‚Äôs next? We‚Äôre all just waiting to see if this ruling will actually make a dent in Google‚Äôs search dominance or if it‚Äôs just another chapter in the ongoing saga of Big Tech vs. The World.

# Uber‚Äôs Q2 Earnings Shift into High Gear

# By the Numbers

* **Earnings per share (EPS):**¬†47 cents (vs. 31 cents expected)
* **Revenue:**¬†$10.7 billion (vs. $10.57 billion expected)
* **Mobility Gross Bookings:**¬†$20.6 billion (up 23% YoY)
* **Delivery Gross Bookings:**¬†$18.1 billion (up 16% YoY)
* **Net Income:**¬†$1.02 billion
* **Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs):**¬†156 million (up 14% YoY)
* **Total Trips:**¬†2.77 billion (up 21% YoY)

# Zooming Past Expectations

Uber ($UBER) put the pedal to the metal in Q2, delivering earnings that sped past Wall Street‚Äôs forecasts. The company reported 47 cents per share, outpacing the expected 31 cents, while revenue came in at $10.7 billion, topping predictions. With its mobility unit seeing a 23% surge in gross bookings and delivery bookings rising 16%, Uber‚Äôs growth engine is firing on all cylinders.

CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was riding high, noting that Uber‚Äôs monthly active platform consumers reached 156 million, a 14% increase from last year, with 2.77 billion trips during the quarter. The market took notice, sending Uber‚Äôs stock up 10.9% following the report.

# Looking Ahead

For the third quarter, Uber is forecasting gross bookings between $40.25 billion and $41.75 billion, with adjusted earnings expected to land between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion. While the midpoint is just shy of analysts' estimates, it still signals that Uber expects to keep cruising along smoothly.

# The Road to Autonomous

Khosrowshahi didn‚Äôt shy away from addressing Tesla‚Äôs ($TSLA) potential robotaxi threat. He assured investors that Uber‚Äôs partnerships with Waymo and other AV players put it in a prime position to dominate the autonomous vehicle space. Uber‚Äôs platform, he emphasized, is unmatched in its ability to offer AV companies the scale they need without the headache of building their own network.

After a rough start to the year, Uber‚Äôs stock is gaining traction. With a focus on innovation and expansion, Uber seems ready to stay ahead in the race for the future of transportation.¬†

# On The Horizon

# Tomorrow

With recession jitters on the rise, all eyes are on the labor market. But while jobs bring in the cash, it‚Äôs the way Americans spend it that really tells the story. As spending slows‚Äîthanks in large part to sky-high inflation‚Äîcompanies start to feel the pinch, forcing McDonald‚Äôs to keep those $5 deals on the menu a bit longer.

That‚Äôs why tomorrow‚Äôs consumer credit report is so important: it‚Äôs a snapshot of not just how much people are spending, but also how much debt they‚Äôre piling up‚Äîthe good (mortgages) and the not-so-good (credit cards). Normally, this report flies under the radar, but this time it could be key in shaping monetary policy in the coming months.

# Before Market Open:¬†

* Disney ($DIS) has hit some turbulence lately, with sky-high prices at theme parks, fierce streaming competition, and cautious consumer spending weighing it down. But recent box office wins have revived some optimism, and Wall Street still believes in the Magic Kingdom: 21 out of 26 analysts rate the stock as a ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù with a target price about 40% higher than its current level. Consensus: $1.19 EPS, $23.05 billion in revenue.
* Shopify ($SHOP) has had a rough 2024, with its stock nosediving due to worries over slowing consumer spending, challenging economic conditions for small businesses, and declining revenue. Investors are eager for signs of a turnaround this quarter, and given the stock‚Äôs current valuation, it might just catch the eye of bargain hunters. Consensus: $0.20 EPS, $2.01 billion in revenue.

# After Market Close:

* Robinhood ($HOOD) blew past analyst expectations last quarter, delivering an EPS of $0.18 versus the expected $0.05. Investors are crossing their fingers for a repeat performance this quarter, though volatility in cryptocurrencies‚Äîa favorite among Robinhood traders‚Äîcould put a dent in trading revenue and profits. Consensus: $0.15 EPS, $631.82 million in revenue.

**Fed Keeps Rates Steady, But September Cut Looms**



Jerome Powell took center stage at the Fed‚Äôs July meeting, setting the scene for what could be a rate-cutting September‚Äîif the data plays nice. While Powell didn‚Äôt drop any explicit hints, his optimism on falling inflation and a cooling labor market has Wall Street betting on a September rate decision.

Here‚Äôs the scoop:

September Cut in the Cards? Powell kept things ambiguous but hinted at a possible rate cut in September. The Fed had a ‚Äúnice conversation‚Äù about it, and while a 50 basis-point move isn‚Äôt likely, Powell left the door open for action if conditions warrant.

A Delicate Balancing Act: Powell described the decision-making process as a ‚Äúvery difficult judgment call,‚Äù outlining scenarios from multiple cuts to none at all. The plan? If inflation keeps easing, growth holds steady, and the job market doesn‚Äôt fall apart, a cut could be on the horizon.

Dovish Vibes: Powell‚Äôs remarks leaned more dovish than the official FOMC statement. With inflation risks decreasing and the labor market softening, he‚Äôs still banking on a soft landing for the economy.

Market Reactions: The stock market loved it, with the S&P 500 inching towards its best day since February. Treasury yields dipped, and the dollar slid as traders began pricing in at least two rate cuts by year‚Äôs end.

Patience, Grasshopper: Despite the growing anticipation, Powell emphasized patience. The Fed‚Äôs dual mandate‚Äîcurbing inflation while keeping employment high‚Äîrequires careful maneuvering. Investors might need to wait for the weather (and rates) to cool down.

So, as summer sizzles on, the Fed‚Äôs next move is still in the oven. Keep an eye on those labor market stats and inflation readings; they‚Äôre the key ingredients for what happens in September.

  
**Meta's Q2: The Zuck Strikes Back**

Meta ($META) is having a moment. Shares popped nearly 7% in after-hours trading after the company not only beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations but also threw down a strong forecast for Q3. So, what‚Äôs driving the hype? Let's dive in.

By the Numbers

Earnings per Share: $5.16 vs. $4.73 expected

Revenue: $39.07 billion vs. $38.31 billion expected

Q3 Revenue Forecast: $38.5 billion to $41 billion

Ad Revenue Growth: 22% year-over-year

Reality Labs Loss: $4.5 billion this quarter

Operating Margin: 38%, up from 29% a year ago

2024 Share Performance: Up 34% year-to-date

Core Business Keeps Delivering

Despite all the chatter about the metaverse and Reality Labs burning through cash like it‚Äôs going out of style (a $4.5 billion loss this quarter, no less), Meta's core business‚Äîdigital advertising‚Äîcontinues to deliver. Ad revenue alone soared 22% year-over-year, driven largely by the Facebook and Instagram power duo. That‚Äôs more than double what rival Alphabet ($GOOGL) pulled off with its ad sales.

On the spending side, Meta's AI and virtual reality ambitions are no small potatoes. The company is shelling out big bucks on infrastructure, with expenses expected to surge even more in 2025 as they continue to scale up. But with AI being the buzzword of the year, investors are keeping a close eye on when those hefty investments will start paying off.

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's head honcho, is bullish. He‚Äôs not only talking up Meta AI as potentially the most used AI assistant by year-end but also boasting about their Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses (because nothing says futuristic like AI-infused eyewear). Plus, Meta‚Äôs open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is making waves in the tech world, pushing the company to the forefront of the AI race.

The Reality Labs Money Pit

Even with all this success, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Reality Labs, Meta‚Äôs bet on the metaverse, is still a money pit, and the legal bills are piling up too. The recent $1.4 billion settlement with Texas over facial recognition data is a reminder that Meta's past still haunts it.

But for now, Zuckerberg's 2023 ""year of efficiency"" mantra is paying off. Meta‚Äôs operating margin jumped to 38%, and the company‚Äôs cost-cutting measures seem to be hitting the right notes with investors. With shares up 34% for the year, double that of the Nasdaq, Meta's comeback story is one for the books.

**On The Horizon**

All eyes were glued to the FOMC announcement today, but now that the dust has settled, things are cooling off as we head into the rest of the week. We‚Äôre still on the lookout for updates with weekly jobless claims, which will shed more light on the labor market, while Q2 nonfarm productivity, ISM manufacturing, and the S&P US manufacturing PMI will offer insights into how the manufacturing sector is faring this month.

On the earnings front, there‚Äôs still plenty of action to keep an eye on.

**Before Market Open:**

Anheuser-Busch Inbev ($BUD) has seen its stock slide over the last year, largely due to a customer boycott following a controversial ad campaign. Adding salt to the wound, competitors like Diageo are also reporting weaker alcohol sales as consumers tighten their belts. Despite these challenges, BUD's brand power remains strong, and Wall Street is still optimistic, with an average analyst price target 26% higher than current levels. Expectations: $0.87 EPS, $13.56 billion in revenue.

Ferrari ($RACE) might seem like it‚Äôs in the same boat as other luxury brands dealing with consumers cutting back, but not so fast. Ferrari buyers aren‚Äôt feeling the pinch of inflation like most folks, and analysts believe the company will keep raking in the profits. Expectations: $2.23 EPS, $1.74 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close:**

Apple ($AAPL) made waves in June at its WWDC event, unveiling AI projects, new phone upgrades, payment services, and more. This earnings report will give investors a closer look at how these new ventures are impacting the bottom line. Wall Street remains bullish, with just one out of 35 analysts rating Apple a ‚Äúsell.‚Äù Expectations: $1.34 EPS, $84.36 billion in revenue.

Amazon (AMZN) hasn‚Äôt seen the same sky-high gains as some other tech giants this year, but investors are still confident in its cloud business, post-pandemic profitability, and AI initiatives. And if you thought the love for Apple was strong, every one of the 39 analysts covering Amazon rates it a ‚Äúbuy.‚Äù Expectations: $1.03 EPS, $148.57 billion in revenue.",08-01-2024

# Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade

In a classic case of ‚Äúso close, yet so far,‚Äù Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company‚Äôs disappointing Azure cloud revenue.

Earnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints

Microsoft‚Äôs revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure‚Äôs performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue‚Äîjust shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub‚Äôs impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn‚Äôt enough to quell investor concerns.

By the Numbers

Revenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected

Market Reaction and Future Outlook

While the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft‚Äôs other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure‚Äôs growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn‚Äôt enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft‚Äôs shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500‚Äôs 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market‚Äôs laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.

**Chips Ahoy! AMD‚Äôs Data Center Sales Surge 115%**

AMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let‚Äôs break it down.

Earnings Breakdown

AMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter

AI Chips and Data Center Dominance

The tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company‚Äôs overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.

Other Segments and Market Reaction

While the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD‚Äôs business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year

AMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.

**On The Horizon**

Tomorrow‚Äôs labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week‚Äôs job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.

**Before Market Open**

**Boeing ($BA)**: Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.

**Marriott International ($MAR)**: The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.

**After Market Close**

**Meta Platforms ($META)**: Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta‚Äôs spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.

**Arm Holdings ($ARM)**: With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm‚Äôs valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",07-30-2024

Rate Cut Countdown ‚Äî Will the Fed Finally Pull the Trigger?

Nope, the Fed isn‚Äôt cutting rates this week. But don‚Äôt snooze just yet‚Äîthis meeting might be the prelude to the September spectacle. Inflation is behaving, and the job market isn‚Äôt overheating, setting the stage for a possible rate cut next month.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is like the Goldilocks of monetary policy‚Äîhe's searching for that ""just right"" balance. He's stuck between the fear of cutting rates too soon and the dread of waiting too long. In his own words to lawmakers, the mission to hit that 2% inflation target while keeping the job market robust is what keeps him up at night. Same, Jerome, same.

Inflation: Cooling Off

Inflation is on a downward slide, with core prices (excluding the wildcards of food and energy) dropping to 2.6% in June from last year‚Äôs 4.3%. New York Fed President John Williams is optimistic, brushing off concerns about the ""last mile"" of inflation reduction. The message? We‚Äôre on the right track, folks.
Unemployment has nudged up to 4.1%, not because jobs are vanishing but because it‚Äôs taking a bit longer to fill vacancies. Powell‚Äôs recent take? The labor market isn‚Äôt adding fuel to inflationary fires anymore. Fed Governor Christopher Waller calls it a ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù‚Äîbalancing demand and job availability without igniting wage spirals.

Risk Management Reboot

With inflation easing and the labor market chilling out, the Fed‚Äôs risk calculus is shifting. The big question: Which is tougher to tackle‚Äîslightly elevated inflation or rising unemployment? The Fed‚Äôs past mistake of waiting too long to hike rates serves as a cautionary tale. But this time, they‚Äôre determined to act promptly to avoid a recession.

Some Fed officials, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, argue that it‚Äôs time to ease off. Inflation has cooled, and the economy doesn‚Äôt seem overheated. Others, including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, urge caution. She warns against hasty moves, emphasizing the importance of achieving price stability first.

The Fed‚Äôs balancing act continues, with eyes set on the September meeting for potential rate cuts. The next FOMC meeting will be held July 30-31.

Same-Store Sales: Down 1% (first decline since 2020)
U.S. Same-Store Sales: Down 0.7%
International Same-Store Sales: Down 1.1%
International Franchised Sales: Down 1.3%

McDonald's ($MCD) Q2 report was a real buzzkill, missing estimates across the board. Revenue clocked in at $6.49 billion, shy of the $6.61 billion expected, and earnings per share hit $2.97 instead of the forecasted $3.07. Same-store sales shrank 1%, a first since 2020. The U.S. saw a 0.7% dip, proving even the mighty Big Mac isn't immune to consumer belt-tightening.

Value Meals to the Rescue

The fast-food titan is leaning on value meals to bring back customers. The $5 meal deal, introduced in late June, has been extended beyond its original four-week run due to its popularity among lower-income diners. This deal saw foot traffic up 2.8% in early July, but it hasn‚Äôt translated into higher overall sales just yet.

Internationally, same-store sales slid 1.1% due to stiff pricing competition and consumer boycotts in places like France. China, a tough market, showed a 1.3% decline, with consumers hunting for deals in a weak economic climate. McDonald's is hustling to maintain its value leader status but admits the gap with competitors has shrunk.

Defying the Odds

Announcing a big Q2 earnings flop usually doesn't result in a 3.74% gain for the stock, but McDonald's defied the odds on Monday. The fast-food giant fell short across several metrics, with leadership admitting the company lost its edge in affordability by hiking prices. Inflation forced the chain to up prices, disrupting long-standing value programs and pushing consumers away.

Despite this, the company's stock is having its best post-earnings day performance in five years. The $5 meal deal, while not yet boosting overall sales, is seen as a key strategy for future growth. Analysts remain optimistic, with most rating the stock as a ""buy"" and none recommending a sell.

Looking Forward

The golden arches are taking a ""forensic approach"" to pricing, aiming to lure back customers with extended value offerings. The $5 meal deal, launched in June, is a cornerstone of this strategy. While immediate financial impacts aren't clear, McDonald's hopes these moves will restore its reputation for affordability and drive future sales.

So, while the numbers were a downer, the company's proactive steps have investors buying into McDonald's vision for the future.

On The Horizon

Tomorrow
Economic Data and Earnings

This week is buzzing with key economic data, especially on the employment front. Tomorrow, we'll get the June JOLTS report, which stands for Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. This report measures job openings, hirings, and separations (like firings and retirements), offering a detailed snapshot of the U.S. job market. The May report surprised everyone with an unexpected increase in job openings, suggesting a stronger labor market. This might just be the signal the Fed needs to consider rate cuts sooner than expected.

Earnings season is heating up, and the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reports tomorrow after the close.

Before Market Open

Corning ($GLW) has unexpectedly become an AI favorite this year. Investors believe the glass and screen maker will benefit from the tech upgrade cycle. However, Corning‚Äôs traditionally steady growth might not match these high expectations. If management doesn‚Äôt deliver impressive forecasts, a selloff could be on the horizon. Analysts are expecting $0.46 EPS and $3.54 billion in revenue.

Paypal ($PYPL) faced a setback when Apple introduced a competing payment service in June. Nonetheless, PayPal remains robust, thanks to its strong e-commerce presence, Venmo's popularity, and its new checkout system, Fastlane. Optimistic shareholders are hoping for an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are $0.89 EPS and $7.14 billion in revenue.

After Market Close

Microsoft ($MSFT) kicks off the Magnificent Seven earnings. Investors are eager to hear updates on its AI investments, Azure cloud computing business, and future plans. Wall Street is optimistic, with all analysts rating it a ""buy."" Expected figures are $2.93 EPS and $64.36 billion in revenue.

Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), a key player in the semiconductor space, will reveal its full-year sales forecast, setting the tone for the industry. Confidence is high, with 30 out of 36 analysts rating it a ""buy"" and a price target 40% above current levels. Expected numbers are $0.68 EPS and $5.72 billion in revenue.",07-29-2024
"This Day In Markets 07/26/2024Stocks wrapped up the rollercoaster week with a strong finish. The Dow spearheaded the gains, soaring 700 points at one point today due to an unexpectedly mighty strong earnings report from 3M ($MMM). The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also bounced back from their recent declines.

Treasury yields dipped slightly, while gold saw a rise following the latest PCE reading. Meanwhile, oil prices fell for the third consecutive week as new economic data from China pointed to lower demand ahead.

Bitcoin experienced a significant jump today as focus shifts to the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, where former President Trump is scheduled to speak tomorrow.

What‚Äôs up üìà

Coursera ($COUR) soared 44.67% due to a strong earnings report and high enrollment in AI courses.

Newell Brands ($NWL) rocketed 40.54% as the turnaround plan for the maker of household brands like Yankee Candle comes to fruition.

3M ($MMM) surged 23% on a fantastic earnings report that saw the company put some major lawsuits behind it and refocus on profits.

Bristol Myers Squibb ($BMY) climbed 11.44% on a beat-and-raise earnings report.

Norfolk Southern ($NSC) jumped 10.95% after handily outperforming expectations, though those estimates were based on a quarter that had a major derailment.

Deckers Outdoor ($DECK) rose 6.32% due to strong sales growth for its HOKA and UGG brands in its recent quarter.

What‚Äôs down üìâ

Dexcom ($DXCM) plunged 40.66% after management cut the diabetes monitoring company‚Äôs full-year revenue guidance.

Weight Watchers ($WW) tumbled 12.50% after Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded the company from overweight to equal weight based on the long-term headwinds it faces from obesity drugs.

Biogen ($BIIB) dropped 7.15% after European regulators denied marketing authorization for the pharma company‚Äôs new Alzheimer‚Äôs drug.


News 

Apple ($AAPL) is no longer among top 5 smartphone vendors in China as domestic brands dominate market

Kroger ($KR) and Albertsons ($ACI) have paused their merger in response to antitrust scrutiny.

American Express ($AXP) has refreshed its Gold Card for the first time since 2018, adding new perks like credits at Dunkin‚Äô and various restaurants.

Warner Bros. Discovery ($WBD) is reportedly suing the NBA after the league refused its matching bid for TV rights, a move that was widely anticipated.

The Disney/Hulu/Max bundle will be priced at $17 per month with ads and $30 without ads.
OpenAI has launched SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine that can summarize its findings and provide links, positioning it as a competitor to Google.

Chipotle ($CMG) is reminding employees to serve generous portions following complaints of small servings.

Spot Ethereum ETFs attracted over $1 billion collectively on their first day of trading earlier this week. 

Let‚Äôs unpack everything that‚Äôs happened in the markets this week:

Ethereum ETFs Get the Green Light: The SEC has finally given the thumbs up to spot ethereum ETFs, allowing investors to buy into funds that track real ethereum, not just futures. These fresh funds pulled in a cool $951 million in trading volume on their second day‚Äîpretty impressive for what's typically a sleepy investment vehicle.

Inflation Cools Down: More inflation data came in cooler than expected. June‚Äôs PCE showed prices increased just 0.1% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year. This slowdown has investors buzzing that the Fed might actually cut rates in September, according to the FedWatch Tool.

Tech‚Äôs Rollercoaster Week: Tesla and Alphabet‚Äôs disappointing earnings reports set off a market-wide selloff on Wednesday, shaving over a trillion dollars off the market. The bright side? Other sectors are doing pretty well, even if tech's outsized presence in the indexes makes it hard to notice. Tech stocks are already starting to claw back some of their losses.

Bitcoin Conference Goes Big:Russell Brand, Cathie Wood, Edward Snowden, and Donald Trump are all on the speaker list for this week‚Äôs Bitcoin Conference. The GOP and digital asset enthusiasts have cozied up, and Trump‚Äôs Saturday speech is highly anticipated to see if he‚Äôll reveal any concrete digital asset policies‚Äîor just more buzzwords.

Bill Ackman‚Äôs Reality Check: Bill Ackman scaled back his lofty goals this week, slashing his closed-end fund‚Äôs target by about 90%.


Busy Week Ahead for Markets

Next week promises to be a pivotal one for the markets. Not only are we hitting the peak of earnings season, but we'll also hear from the Federal Open Market Committee regarding the central bank's plans for interest rate cuts.

Following today's PCE announcement, much of Wall Street anticipates a rate cut in September. However, the most optimistic investors are hopeful that the Fed will surprise everyone and initiate cuts this month. Given that the Fed has stated rate cuts will be data-dependent, it's more likely that Jerome Powell and his team will want to gather additional data before making any decisions.

On the data front, most of next week's economic reports will focus on employment. The JOLTS report comes out on Tuesday, ADP on Wednesday, and the US jobs report on Friday.

Earnings Next Week:

Monday: McDonald's ($MCD), ON Semiconductor ($ON), Chesapeake Energy ($CHK), Tilray Brands ($TLRY), and Sprouts Farmers Market ($SFM).

Tuesday: Procter & Gamble ($PG), Merck ($MRK), Pfizer ($PFE), Microsoft ($MSFT), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), BP ($BP), PayPal ($PYPL), Corning ($GLW), Starbucks ($SBUX), and Pinterest ($PINS).

Wednesday: Mastercard ($MA), Meta Platforms ($META), Qualcomm ($QCOM), T-Mobile ($TMUS), Boeing ($BA), Marriott International ($MAR), Wingstop ($WING), and eBay ($EBAY).

Thursday: Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Intel ($INTC), Toyota ($TM), The Cigna Group ($CI), Shell ($SHEL), Dominion Energy ($D), Coinbase ($COIN), Doordash ($DASH), and Ferrari ($RACE).

Friday: Exxon Mobil ($XOM), Chevron ($CVX), Squarespace ($SQSP), and Church & Dwight Co. ($CHD).

"Im a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 22/07 as tech looks for a bounce in premarket. ANALYSIS:

* **Understand that whilst vix is up, it is a case of positioning and squeeze rather than genuine concern in market. The other risk gage, credit default swaps Continues to go lower. Suggests this pullback won't be sustained. This is not looking like start of a deep correction even though technicals look weaker.** Geopolitical noise etc obviously isn't a major concern else credit swaps would be rising.
* [https://imgur.com/a/OGJIzGB](https://imgur.com/a/OGJIzGB)¬†
* On VIX: we saw a big jump last week. This was mostly due to OPEX, and the Vix expiration, which removed a lot of the put delta which was suppressing VIX. I Expect that VIX will get crushed again soon, but looking at the positioning it doesnt look ready to crush meaningfully just yet. I say this because the term structure is in backwardation, and look at the positioning, skewed to OTM calls, not ITM puts which is what we have been used to.¬†
* [https://imgur.com/a/90V7XPV](https://imgur.com/a/90V7XPV)
* AS mentioned, we probably need news catalyst to remove this call delta.¬†
* Nonetheless, higher VIX doesnt mean equities can‚Äôt move higher. As I mentioned before, this is normal seasonal action for VIX to rise at this time of the year.¬†
* NVDA: we have seen NVDA price action weak of late, dragged with other semis and mega caps in general. However, as Goldman Sachs and CIti point out, I think this kind of sell off is dangerous for bears. Goldman Have already pointed out that NVDA are expected to release a few new updates in their earnings report and will also explain how their AI chips are helping companies to make money. This will be a bullish catalyst. Positioning shows mostly bearish flows. This flow is probably ready to get squeezed soon IMO based on fundamental catalysts. We have seen it all year on every pullback, I think this time is no different.¬†
* GOLD:
* Positioning overall is weakening, as traders hedge, hence price action falling. We have called that since last week. However, on August expiry, we see traders are still bullish. Just hedging in the near term, but overall, with rate cuts coming, should see gold perform still.



DATA LEDE:

* China cut the 1 year loan prime rate to 3.35% vs the expectation to maintain at 3.45%
* Cuts the 5 year loan prime rate to 3.85%, vs expectation to maintain at 3.95%
* So in both cases, we saw a cut by 10bps, against expectations.¬†



MARKETS:¬† Nasdaq outperforming as much of the premarket action being driven by NVDA, semis and AAPL.¬†

* SPX: Tested 5500 on Friday, but closed above. Today is trading higher following B.iden stepping down as presidential candidate. Trading at 5539.¬†
* Nasdaq:¬† Trading up 0.8% in premarket. Closed On Friday just above the 50D MA, today moving higher by 0.9%, is trading at 19,700.¬†
* Dow Jones: Flatter than others, as most of the-market action is in semis.¬†
* Ger40: trading higher by 1.5% Trading at 18,430. Above the 18,350 support. Positioning is strong.¬†
* HKG50: trading higher after PBOC cuts prime rate by 10bps against expectations.¬†
* Gold: Slightly lower, trading below 2400. Positioning showing hedging but should recover soon.¬†
* Oil - slightly lower on weakening positioning and excess supply.¬†

"What do I do with my Tesla optionThis morning I bought one tesla call with a strike price of $257.5, the contract went for $8.85 (now going for $5.65) and it was ITM at the time. I held the contract even as tesla fell hoping that it'd make a move back up (I didn't follow my SL). When market closed today I was down $320 on the paper account that had $1180 before I took this trade. The contract expires July 19th. Although it's a paper account I want to treat this as if it's real money and that's why I'm making this post. What do you all think I should do? Right now my plan is to see the first three hours of tomorrows market and if it isn't looking bullish I'll cut my losses. Is that a good idea or should I give it more time. I'm thinking I'll cut my losses if they exceed $400. Overall what do you guys think would be best for me to do?",07-15-2024

* [**https://imgur.com/a/LpuUCdz**](https://imgur.com/a/LpuUCdz)¬†
*  **NVDA: Vol skew points higher. Positioning looks far more bullish now into August as bears basically got squeezed and were forced to close positioning. We see strong call delta ITM and OTM. Positioning has improved, increasing on 140 and 150.**

* HOOD:
* **HOOD: pared the gains yesterday, to close inside the triangle. Hence no breakout yet, but positioning still looks good. BTC is up, and we SHOULD get a soft CPI tomorrow, so the fundamentals, positioning and technicals should align for move higher soon. Target still 25.**

"Is crypto bull cycle this time different?Is there something new in this bull cycle that the altcoins are not performing well and are still dry? Layer 1 Blockchains have performed way better than rest of the altcoins.

This bull cycle is giving out a different vibe than the ones we have seen before. Lot of inflows were seen in big projects while the altcoins with low cap still have low liquidity and no serious gains. Your crypto portfolio with big market cap projects would have performed way better than 50x/moon coins.

**What could be the reason?**

1. Experienced investors are reducing risk and going after high liquidity.
2. New retail investors have not entered this bull cycle.
3. Lot of people with shitcoins have converted them into heavy weight coins.
4. Are we becoming smart :D

"Thoughts on nvda### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA‚Äôs investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA‚Äôs market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA‚Äôs manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA‚Äôs market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",06-12-2024

"10/06 Premarket cheat sheet - all the news, catalysts and stock specific updates driving price action today, and some potential expectations for the week ahead. ANALYSIS:

* On Monday Tuesday, I expect probably more choppiness until the Fed. We probably see a similar choppiness to on Friday last week, with oscillation around 5350. key levels are 5350 as the pivot. 5325 will be an area of support. Probably see oscillation in range of 5300-5400, but let's see. i will post levels more precisely daily during the week. Potential risks to that are a post NVDA stock split, but positioning for the market remains bullish for now.
* CPI - Now most of the data sources I am watching suggest that CPI probably comes in line or soft. But regardless, the main event will be the FOMC.
* Basically, volatility is in very steep contango. This means that vol sellers are sitting there absolutely ready to crush volatility down. This means that if Vol spikes after FOMC/CPI, probably we see a vix crush and we may see bears getting squeezed. This could make for a nice buy the dip.
* Market appears to be expecting a more dovish Powell from what I am reading.
* Possibly could be a non event, or a catalyst for a squeeze imo. Obviously if he comes super hawkish, I can be wrong, but the volatility set up does strike me as the fact that any sell off will be a nice buy the dip opporutnity.
* Personally, I expect him to say that they will bring inflation down, full commitment, remain month by month data driven approach. Will probably say that they are expecting inflation to be more difficult to get down than before, which can be enough to make the amrket drop initially, but I do think he will point to weakness in the labour market and suggest that they are monitoring it, and that if it gets weaker it can be reason to cut rates. This then could lead to the bears having to unwind positions, vix crush, and a squeeze higher.
* IF powell is dovish, IWM will probably be one of the trades to be in.

DAta lede:

* Japanese GDP price index comes 3.4% YOY vs forecast of 3.6%. Previous reading was 3.7%
* SO prices are lower than expected, not good for inflation hopes, so points to more dovish BOJ.
* GDP annualised growth was -1.8% vs -1.9% expected.¬†
* So weak GDP, but slowed less than expected, which is good.¬†
* No major economic data announcements today.¬†

* Increased uncertainty, hence EURUSD lower.¬†
* GBPUSD lower in sentiment with EURUSD. ¬†
* USD higher as a safe haven assets after far right parties advance in EU elections. When investors are not comfortable with something, they rotate into USD and that‚Äôs what we are seeing here.¬†

"About margin interest I know there‚Äôs no interest charge if you closed your position in the end of day.  For example, I have a 100k account, I bought Tesla stock for 100k and sold it right away when I had profits.  Repeat the same process 8 times.  So I traded total amount 800k intraday.   If I decided to hold the position(100k)  overnight , how does the brokers charged the interest? Do they charge the interest 
For the 700k you use for the trading? Or do they charge the 100k for the interest? Or they charged nothing since you don‚Äôt hold 2x position?  Thank you for anyone who can answer the question ",06-07-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket, including full expectations for NFP based on the positioning data and a look at VIX. ANALYSIS AND EXPECTATIONS BASED ON POSITIONING FOR THE DAY:

* Eurusd skew points higher today and in near term expires. The main learning we take from this is that traders expect dollar to fall today. Aka they expect soft jobs numbers.¬†
* If we look at chfusd similar, v bullish skew. Is v positive for chf as it breaks out, but also tells us traders expect dollar to fall.
* If we are to see this, we can see SPX reach 5390-5400 as we can see a squeeze higher. From there, it depends on the report as to whether we bounce from here or break higher, which will crate more squeeze. Realistically, expectation is bounce from here.¬†
* If we look at VIX, there is a strong wall at 12.5. That will be hard to break, but is v possible on weak NFP.¬† Some hedging form traders, they are basically trying to cover themselves against hot jobs numbers surprise by buying calls on VIX, but if we look at term structure we see its in contango. Traders are not expecting volatility, traders are still short on VIX. VIX is expected to fall and equities should rise.¬†
* Key pivot is the 5350 level.
* Below that we have 5335 as a key level
* And 5300 is the level where gamma turns negative. Break below here can lead to more downside, but this will eb a strong support.¬†
* For a down day, we‚Äôd need to see break below the 5335 level with VIX rising, otherwise we probably just see vix crush later in the day, which will fuel recovery and dips to be bought.¬†
* At the same time, Gold positioning was bullish last night as price action was starting to recover, but the fundamental news that China is halting its gold buying for reserves after an 18 month stretch of buying has sent it lower. Realistically, we can expect it to be weak today, or in near future on this. But if NFP comes weak this will help to limit the decline in short term.¬†

DATA LEDE:

* Japan Household spending comes in slightly below expectations at 0.5% YOY vs forecasts for 0.6% YOY increase.
* MOM came weak.¬†
* So Japanese household spending came weaker than expected. However, it‚Äôs worth noting, that despite this, it is the first month in the last year that YOY household spending came at least positive.¬†
* CHINA balance of Trade:
* Exports came stronger than expected at 7.6% vs 6%. Highest YOY improvement since January.¬†
* So stronger global demand than expected
* Imports came weak, 1.8%vs 4.2% expected.
* So weaker domestic demand¬†
* German imports were better than expected, as were exports. So good Balance of trade reading there.¬†
* UK house prices up by 1.5% YOY. Highest increase since February. Housing market recovers in UK on rate cut expectations.¬†
* EUROZONE GDP growth rate final estimates come same as previous estimate, so no surprise there. Was priced in.¬†
* The big one: NFP and Unemployment rate. Keep an eye on Hourly earnings.¬†

MARKETS:

* HKG50: Lower by 1.3%, today. Trading at 18300. Pullback from 18,600 at open.
* We can see a fairly consistent trend with HKG50 atm, where the wicks are high to the upside, then they sell off into the close. Today we wipe out the gains from the whole week.¬†
* Oil: Cautiously higher, trading at 76 WTI
* Gold lower as¬† China is halting its gold buying for reserves after an 18 month strength of buying.
* VIX at 12.84. Wall is at 12.5.¬†

"Stock option traders who trade daily Hey guys, I don‚Äôt have too many trader friends and I trade stock options daily (mostly SPX and Tesla)

Are there any traders on here that would be down to hop in a call during market hours.

I‚Äôve always found the best success when I‚Äôm bouncing my ideas off of others and I don‚Äôt know anywhere where traders are just in a group call chatting.

"$TSLA FOMO - No bueno.Was being self-disciplined earlier today. In a moment of weakness caught FOMO on the way down, and was like it broke through the low of the day, it will keep going.... wrong. Literally bought a put contact at the low of day. Cost me $40.  No matter how much it looks like it will keep going.. no it won't.

How do taxes work for buying and selling stocks in general? Not necessarily day trading. I started investing overall recently and I made trades in my Roth IRA so I don't think I need to worry about taxes in this case. But for regular investment accounts say you bought Tesla at 170 dollars and it goes to 200 and sell. You earn 30 dollars. But then imagine 2 months from now you make a new trade bought Tesla or whatever company at 180 and  sold at 100 to cut your losses. Do you still pay taxes on the 30 dollars even though you are down overall? And would it be at the same tax bracket as your other income? Or is it based on how much you earn overall by the end of the year during tax time. How would these factors differ if it was a day trade vs several months.  I know there is something called washsale rule or wahtever but as long as you don't claim losses for deduction then it shouldn't matter right?,05-24-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is my full pre market cheat sheet, including full positioning updates for SPX and QQQ following yesterdays dip. Whats changed in the market? **24/05**

ANALYSIS: 

* Key economic data to come today, with inflation expectations and Durable goods.
* Skew and positioning on EURUSD points higher, so expectation is for dollar to fall form key level of 105, but lets see.¬†
* SPX Skew points higher, QQQ closed above 450 wall which is supportive. SPX shows increasing call volume, and some put selling.¬†
* Probably see lower volatility today as IV remains lower, but traders are still bullish and it looks like today will be a choppy day with upward direction, but lets see.¬†
* 5300 wall.¬†
* Positioning unchanged after yesterday. Basically no impact, market brushed it off it seems. But lets see with the data.¬†

Update on yesterday:

* If we saw on spx last few days there was some hedging some hedging prior to fomc and nvda in previous updates but bullish positioning overall.
* Even though nvda earnings came decent, and I'd say decent rather than amazing because of gross margin guidance, market still sold off because of hawkishness of yday fomc minutes plus some China Taiwan fears which r overblown for sure. Also PMI data came strong as did Jobless claims, which got traders doubting rate cuts again.
* Bsically, traders were taking this as an opportunity to trim, ahead of holiday weekend and using the ample liquidity there on NVDA earnings. Premarket moves dont always predict market open moves btw. Premarket has low volume and often fools investors, so whilst SPX and QQQ pumped in premarket, you had to look in the first half an hr, especially after jobless claims came hot to understand what the market is doing.
* Institutions are still long on this market btw. Id take this as a look that lots of stocks starting to present opportunities again as the market pulls back.
* BTW pull back is even a bit mcuj to say. The Iran pullback was a pullback, this is a 1% dip from ATH.
* Still, for me I think there are things that now look more attractive, some in semis, smci, crypto miners, many industrial names as dow comes back to 39k.
* Would still bet on 5300 return. More later

  
BTW gold and silver positioning looks like a BUy the dip coming.

"I'm a full time trader and this is my total pre market cheat sheet, including positioning analysis on US markets, NVDA, TSLA and FX. ANALYSIS:

Overall US Market:

* SPX Skew is elevated, traders remain bullish. Skew points slightly down, but this is hedging ahead of FOMC. Traders selling some calls but its v low volume.¬†
* Note: positioning and trader sentiment around NVDA remains bullish.¬†
* Because of this positive expectation around NVDA, traders are buying calls on QQQ. Traders expect Nasdaq rot continue to go higher.¬†
* So we do see some disparity there in what traders are doing. They are more bullish on tech right now ahead of NVDA.¬†
* Momentum continues to show stronger buyers, we are at ATH on both QQQ and SPX.¬†
* MSFT and NFLX both hit new highs yesterday.¬†
* VIX liquidity continues to be very low, whilst liquidity in equities is increasing. The fact that VIX liquidity is very low is a sign that traders have no real fear in the market. Bulls v comfortable right now.

On FX & metals:

* As mentioned in other post, GBPUSD positioning bullish, particularly after CPI came hotter than expected. Short term and long term we see skew point up. 1.28 target. on EURUSD, skew points higher but price is stuck below 1.085 for now. 1.08 is clear support, traders target 1.09, even calls on 1.10.
* On Gold and Silver, we can see a slight pullback or flattening whilst traders wait to see more volume. V low volume but mostly traders selling their calls now and buying puts. Still low volumes though so not expecting big moves. But also not seeing big move higher yet.

Key stocks for focus:

* **NVDA: skew is flattish this week but pointing higher. Traders will be looking for 1000 if earnings come in in line. More if stock split. A lot of calls around there. As a result of NVDA earnings looking higher, SMCI higher too. Other semis in general quite bullish on hopeful expectations for NVDA.**
* **TSLA: Got bit of a jump yday as skew pointed higher and we got good news to support. Gamma is mostly between 180-190. Can see move to 190 if NVDA supports, but beyond that not much OTM call gamma. Positioning iTM is strong but not seeing move higher. More likely possible rejection from 100D MA.**



DATA LEDE:

* UK CPI: Headline came out 2.3% vs 2.1% expected. Still down a lot on the 3.2% last month. Hot, but not that bad.¬†
* But if we look under the hood, we see that there are areas of the UK inflation that are heating up.¬†

"Which one produce more retail trader Millionaires ? Stock or forex ?Hi everyone, I first started my trading journey with forex in 2014 . I thought that would be rich quick thanks to exponential interest but ended up losing for 4 years ! üò≠ 

Then I got rid of my mindset to get rich fast and totally opened my mind to new stuff ! I read a lot of success stories about stock investing and trading! I studied countless of hours millionaire maker stock like Tesla , Microsoft, Nvidia and apple just to name a few! I read many books on stock market too . Then I understood that there  more chance to be successful in stock trading and investing than the famous day trading! I developed a breakout strategy to buy momentum stock when they make new high on weekly chart. It's a momentum sign when the market rise . I will do a post about my strategy soon . I am profitable now!

After all , it's logical because the 2 only factors that are proven to drive a stock price up in the long term are its sales growth and its profits growth! Add a breakout system to it can make the strategy powerful.

I saw some outstanding success stories on the stock markets with traders who turned a couple of  thousands of dollars into millions. 

I exclude crypto because it's pure gambling! I also exclude hedge funds because they are not retail investors and traders like us !

Here are some stock trading and investing outstanding success stories!

Kristian Qullamaggie: turned 9k into $100 million
Jason Debolt : turned 30k to 12 million (Tesla)
Dan zanger :turned 10k into 42 million 
Cis : turned 30 into 300 million 
BNF : turned 13k into 150 million
Tim Sykes : turned 5k into many millions 
Ross Cameron: turned 583 into 11 million 
Keith Gill : turned 50k into 50 million 
Chris Camillo : turned 20 k into 40 million 

These are just some of the countless of incredible success stories from swing trading stocks ! 

I also noted that there are  also thousands of ordinary investors that started from nothing and built a huge wealth for themselves because they are a good stock picker ! Among them some are even billionaires. There's Stewart Horesjsi who became a retail investor billionaire , specially with his bet on Berkshire Hathaway. There is also Herbert Wertheim who is worth $5,3 billion. He made strategic bets on Apple and Microsoft ! These people are not traders ,they are long term investors ! It's to show you the power of the stock market to build wealth for an ordinary investor when he play it right! 

But when I do online research about a retail trader who made millions thanks to forex ,there don't seem to be a lot of positive results! It's weird because there are a lot of gurus that said that they are rich because of forex trading! I know that many are pure fraud!


Tell me if am wrong and if you know some retail traders who made it big in forex ! 

Thanks for your answers and be respectful! üôè",05-19-2024
"These are the stocks on my watchlist (5/15)**These are the stocks on my watchlist (5/15)**

Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.

This is a daily watchlist for trading.

I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you‚Äôre on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.

Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on \_\_\_\_\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question\~.\~

Meme stocks are the most interesting thing I‚Äôm watching today.

* Will keep it brief here. 
* We continue to see choppiness under SPX 5200 and in and around QQQ 440.

* VIX is at 13.5, but not seeing much puts open up OTM which tells us it probably doesnt yet crush much lower.
* As such we probably see a choppy day.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket including positioning analysis. 06.05ANALYSIS:

* We are trading at or near the 50SMA on both QQQ and SPX.
* We see that with the technicals here:
* Here is SPX:
* [https://imgur.com/a/byLBGna](https://imgur.com/a/byLBGna)
* Here is Nasdaq:
* [https://imgur.com/a/EwT4qXb](https://imgur.com/a/EwT4qXb)
* We saw Nasdaq actually reversed off of the 50 day Moving average.
* Now, these technical are something we want to watch, but aren‚Äôt everything. I read a number of people talking about them on CNBC and even on twitter. Are they important? Kind of. Does it mean we head lower? Not necessarily.
* Why are they kind of important? For the simple fact that other people watch them. Hedge funds are actually not as sophisticated with their technical analysis as you might think, and often they watch the 50 day moving average. Above it, is bullish, below it is bearish in their mind.
* As such, we can see them try to remove positioning if 50D SMA doesn‚Äôt break in first few days of this week.
* However, does it mean we head lower? No, not really. It can easily break through, and QQQ positioning looks strong overall, so I suggest that although we can get some short term consolidation/profit taking under the 50d SMA, it will likely break soon.
* Traders are actually increasing bullish sentiment in the market right now. Call delta is increasing and skew is pointing higher.
* For both QQQ and SPY, skew is pointihg higher than spot price which means traders are betting market goes higher from here.
* VIX is trading under 14. It means market makers are increasing liquidity. It means fear is limited. Dollar is coming down again after dovish Powell, and bonds should fall again soon. IWM could out perform, as it opened above the 50d Moving average on Friday, and managed to hold above it.
* IWM is interest rate sensitive, so as the jobs numbers came lower, which increases chance of rate cuts, we can see it push higher towards 205.
* VIX/ OVerall market fear:
* ITRX XOVER credit default swaps head lower. This is another indicator that tells us about fear and risk in the market. Conclusion, traders not really very worried. This tends to have correlation to VIX, so is supportive of VIX heading lower.
* This should support equity index higher.
* OIL:
* Vol skew on Oil still points towards potential bounce. News of Gaza ceasefire collapse a humanitarian disaster but good for oil. Saudi extend production cuts too which is bullish. Signs of possible bounce up here, as traders unwind puts.
* GOLD:
* GOLD: Skew also points higher now. Traders are unwinding puts as hopes of interest rate cuts rise again after NFP data on Friday. Holding above 2300 is key and supportive for bulls.

DATA LEDE:

* So PPI declined in Eurozone in line with expectations, which is bullish as points to future disinflation.
* EUROZONE INVESTOR CONFIDENCE INDEX came -3.6, way better than the previous reading of -5.9, and better than forecast of -5.
* So we are seeing improved confidence in Eurozone, as economy improves and sees continued disinflation.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC.**ANALYSIS:**

*  Positioning ahead of FOMC is risk off. We see bond yields higher, we see dollar higher, we see institutional money flow out of BTC which is a risk on asset, we see traders buying calls on VIX to hedge for downside. 
* This is why we are seeing markets drop to 5000 level on SPX with the Fed meeting imminent.
* I do think Powell comes hawkish too to be honest. The last meeting, he was happy to dismiss a couple of hot inflation prints as part of the rocky road to 2%, but now we have multiple more hot prints. SO probably he will push back on immediate rate cuts, which can send markets lower.
* Note the data does not support a 2nd wave of inflation though. Oil price positioning is to come lower which will bring headline down. PPI and PPI in europe still suppressed so not a leading indicator of hot inflation to come. 
* What we see after FOMC? What will the market do? Well, simply put, its positioned to go down then piush up again, but will that happen? Who knows at this point, because no one knows what Powell will say. We have to see basically. A bullish Powell, who doesnt say anything overly hawkish can push markets back to 5100 by tomorrow. A hawkish Powell can send down to 4900 today. 
* Oil positioning is looking more bearish. 
* Silver positioning looks ready for a possible bounce back up.

DATA LEDE:

* UK S&P Global manufacturing PMI comes in better than previously reported at 49.1 vs 48.7.

* Low from Israel situations as at 17k
* Dow - trading at 37720. Broke below 38k yesterday. Support was at 37,750 which it has now gone below.

* OIL: Down more, breaks the downtrend, down 1% to 80.54. 
* GOLD: Below 2300. Will try to recover 2300 level, but will face pressure as dollar heads higher. Gold is up right now on safe haven appeal.

* Let‚Äôs look at and analyse the main things happening in premarket first of all. 
* Firstly, the Yen intervention, which Japan‚Äôs Kanda hasn‚Äôt confirmed but reports are out from DJ that thats what happened this morning. 
* We saw yen weaken to 160 vs the USD. This was touted by JPM as the intervention point that BOJ were looking at, although their commentary last week was all very much vague. 
* When we saw 160 hit, we saw a big drop in USDJPY, as yen squeezed higher. 
* The price action was more extreme because Japan has a national holiday today, hence trading volumes were thin. 
* WE saw it drop from 160 to 154.5
* It found support from the technicals at the 20 day Moving average, as we see below:
* We saw recovery above the 155 level. 155 is one of the key gamma levels, where there is a lot of put support there. The bigger key gamma level, below this is 152. There is a hell of a lot of put support at 152. If the BOJ wants the yen to meaningfully improve vs the USD, it needs to get USDJPY below 152. Thats when we can go meaningfully lower. Above there, and we expect it to find support from these gamma levels and move higher, as we saw it do from 155. 
* Skew actually points higher in USDJPY now. This tells us that traders are not really expecting much more meaningful intervention right now. We can see USDJPY move higher again soon. Probably won‚Äôt be as effective as BOJ hoped. 
* Now the other key news from premarket, is TESLA, who have now received the regulatory approval for FULL self driving in China, rather than the limited product they had on offer already. 
* Tesla is pumping in premarket. 
* If we look at the gamma levels, we see 200 as having a lot of open interest. As such, we can see it as a magnet for price action moving forward. 
* FTSE pushed higher to 8200, but we see skew lowering. This tells us traders are hedging for price action to mveo lower now. The move is likely close to done for now, except if the Fed support move higher. We expect that because OTM delta isnt really showing much call delta so traders aren‚Äôt betting FTSE goes much higher. 
* HKG50 breakout from downtrend since 2023 continues, hitting 18k level today. 18k is v big gamma level, hence why we saw price action reverse from here. 
* In SPX, we see traders unwind some of their hedges as they bet that geopolitical pressures are mostly behind us. We see that too, as oil skew points lower which suggests traders expect oil to move down soon. 
* Finally, busy week ahead. 
* This week ahead, we have FOMC decision on Wednesday, as well as jobs numbers throughout the week, which will give us some insight into the labour market. 
* Put on top of that all the following earnings reports, and we are set for a volatile week of trading. 

DATA LEDE:

* Spain inflation rate:
* 3.3% YOY vs 3.4% expected, previous reading was 3.2%
* SO ticked up from last month, but not as much as expected. 
* GERMAN inflation rate:

MARKETS:

* SPX set to open above 5100 this morning, pulled up by Tesla and Aapl. Currently trading at 5112. This is just above the highs of Friday. 
* Nasdaq: up 0.3% in premarket, trading at 17,780. 17,850 is a resistance, then The next big resistance will be the 18k level. 
* Dow Jones: Flat in premarket, trading at 38,300. 
* HKG50 up 1% again in premarket. Now at 17,750. Touched 18k then came down from there. 18k is now the strong resistance. 
* UK100 higher to 8200, pared slightly to 8180. Still up 0.4% today. 
* GER40: flat around 18,140.
* Oil: Flat at 83.65. Maintaining the uptrend drawn since December 2023. 
* GOld: Flat above 2300. 
* VIX: Vix flat at 15.22. last week closed perfectly at the put support of 15. Was a big VIX crush last week. Opened today at 15.22. 

FX:

* USDJPY closed Friday at 158.3.
* In early Monday trading, it moved up to 160. This was a key level where traders were hedging for intervention.
* It seemed as though we did get that fX intervention hence the big decline.
* This decline was right down to 154.5
* This is where the 20 day Moving average was and so it found support there.
* Also a key gamma level at 155. 
* It moved below this level, before recovering above again. 
* Note: its a national holiday in Japan, hence why more exaggerated trading on thin volumes. 
* Despite this no official comment from BOJ that they have intervened, although that is the clear assumption. 
* So Yen squeezed higher after hitting 160 vs USD
* All other currencies quite flat compared.
* GBPUSD up 0.3% to 1.253EURUSD same trend, up 0.2% after selling off on Friday. Now at 1.071. On Friday, it retested 1.07 before pushing higher.

"$ALLG Allego - likely to be ideal for day-traders[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-allego-partner-electrify-european-143000121.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-allego-partner-electrify-european-143000121.html)

* Recent price action
   * Has been stable around one, on very low volume (unlikely to drop much before earnings) 
   * Has been running into previous earning calls (which got delayed)  on high volume, but got delayed due to a form lacking.  I assume as soon as earnings are announced/form filed, this will once again become a roller-coaster. 

==============================================================

* **The market**
   * **Shell** [Energy](https://www.the-sun.com/topic/energy/)**, an energy force to be reckoned with in the United States, has one of the largest** [gas](https://www.the-sun.com/topic/gas/) **station footprints in the nation.To meet the growing need for public EV charging stations, however, Yahoo! Finance** **reported** **the company's announcement to shut down 1,000 gas pumps and replace them with public EV charging hubs.""We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs,"" read the company's 2024 Energy Transition Strategy.**
      * This news tells us, what Shell (and thus other market players) are thinking, and of course that demand globally will be rising.
* **Company overview:**
   * Allego NV (based in The Netherlands) provides and operates EV charging locations throughout Europe. They have all kinds of chargers, ranging from slow charging to ultrafast, but their focus is fast charging (50 - 125 KW) on parking lots. They operate 34.000+ charging points throughout Europe.
* **The stock**
   * is undervalued. In the US sentiment for EV-related stocks is very bad. Most EV stocks were hyped a couple of years ago and have failed to deliver on the big growth promises. This resulted in a big sell-off of anything related EV. But this company is not on the US market. It's a European company and the European market is totally different.
* **Sales**
   * In Europe EV sales are still growing, helped by legislation. Although consumers are still reluctant to buy one, big organisations are all switching to EVs. Most big companies or government organisations have strict CO2 reduction goals and switching to EVs is a quick win.
* The company
   * started in The Netherlands, which has been one of the front-runners in EV adoption. Bigger countries, such as France and Germany were slower to adopt EVs, but are catching up rapidly (again: helped by legislation). In these countries there's a very urgent need for more charging locations and a lot of public tenders and business partnerships are offered to provide these chargepoints rapidly. Only very few companies are able to provide these many charging locations in a short amount of time, so Allego is very quickly winning contracts all over Europe. Their expertise and strong steady financial position has allowed Allego to grow FAST at the moment. There's not a lot of competition in Europe: some other big initiatives for providing charging solutions are mainly focused on stand-alone locations next to the major roads (such as FastNed, Ionity or Tesla).
* **Financially**
   * Third quarter 2023 revenue increased 28.2% to ‚Ç¨28.6 million, compared to ‚Ç¨22.3 million in the prior year period.
   * Third quarter 2023 charging revenue increased 53.0% to ‚Ç¨22.0 million, compared to ‚Ç¨14.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.
   * Gross profit increased to ‚Ç¨5.4 million compared to ‚Ç¨(4.6) million in the prior-year-period; gross margin during the quarter was 18.9%.
   * Third quarter 2023 net loss was ‚Ç¨(43.1) million, compared to ‚Ç¨(22.1) million in the prior-year period; Operational EBITDA was ‚Ç¨2.6 million reflecting higher charging revenue and improved charging gross margin compared to the prior-year period loss of ‚Ç¨(3.1) million.
   * Allego recently signed two power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy per year with Energy Solutions Group, the largest independent green energy producer in the Benelux region, with renewable energy sourced from a solar park that is expected to be operational in January 2024, and a wind farm that is expected to be completed in January 2025.
   * In October, Allego recorded over 1 million sessions per month across its network.

"These are the stocks on my watchlist (3/26)  

This is a watchlist. I might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers).

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade.

You can see at the last 1hr candle at close CVX closed within the penny of catching vwap support. Whereas INTC you can see closed within .03 of missing MA10 support.

"What did i miss on this trade? (TSLA)Testing ORB strategy in 5 min TF with TSLA today and failed.

So i bought the second it broke the range upward (even tho i saw the down trend on 1h candles and determined that it was most likely gonna be a bearish open) and it quikly went down to my stop. Did i rush it and bought too soon? Or was the biggest mistake not listening to myself when i saw a down trend and buying anyways? Because even if i shorted when it broke downward i would have been stopped anyways right? Because the wick of the third candle when up quite a bit.

If i missed something that would have told me it was a bad idea to go with TSLA please tell me because i'm not sure if it's the strategy that failed or me (Guessing it was me).

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket ahead of FOMC meeting today.**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday, we saw an early dip in the equity markets as SPX touched 5123, and QQQ touched 433.
* However, as mentioned in the premarket report and continually mentioned in my commentaries, traders remain incredibly short volatility. 
* AS such, that created the usual vix crush as we see here, with VIX dropping below 13.
* [https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf](https://imgur.com/a/KfchMYf) 
* This fuelled market makers to add liquidity, which led to the usual intraday recovery back to 5180 and 438.5. 
* Today, we have the FOMC meeting which will be the key focus, as will the updated dot plot which will be released. 
* We are seeing low volume in options ahead of this, as traders are basically waiting for it. 
* On January and February CPI coming in ahead of expectations, and with Shelter and Core inflation remaining very sticky, there is some likely expectation that Powell will be less dovish. 
* I think that‚Äôs probably true, he will be more hawkish, but it appears traders are not expecting him to be outright hawkish as such. 
* Probably more neutral, pointing to the fact that inflation is coming down, and will affirm their intention to continue bringing inflation down. He will probably continue to say that they just need to see more of the same before moving to cutting. More of the usual data dependence commentary, but with hints that cuts will still be on the table. 
* Credit Default swaps don‚Äôt show any signs of major alarm, and continue to head lower. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo](https://imgur.com/a/PTPNoBo) 
* Traders are hedging into today‚Äôs meeting. Dollar is increasing in premarket. Nonetheless, traders remain very short volatility still. Inflation swaps are still pricing inflation to come down later in the year, even if it appears that it is stuck for now. 
* I think that off the back of this, we do probably see dollar increase, hence why I haven‚Äôt averaged my positions against USD today and averaged with very little size yesterday. Looking at the equity market, we probably see some volatility, and a dip, but vol will probably crush again, so any VIX spike probably won‚Äôt last long, which should again fuel market makers to add liquidity to aid the recovery (not necessarily same day recovery, but short term nonetheless). 
* On next monthly expiry, we have seen 5300 accumulate gex quite a bit recently, so traders are still looking higher, but hedge for some volatility.
* As mentioned previously, we can see traders open puts inr response to a possible hawkish Powell, and then get squeezed again and forced to short cover, as we have seen repeatedly over the course of this rally, and as we saw on Monday. Shorting probably not the way forward as traders are still bullish on medium expiries. 

**DATA LEDE**

* China maintain their loan prime rate for 1 year and 5 year at current rates
* UK INFLATION
* Core inflation falls to 4.5%, below estimates of 4.6%. Previous reading was 5.1%, where it was stuck for the last 3 months. 
* Headline inflation came 3.4%, below estimates fo 3.5% and down from 4% where it was for last 3 months. 
* Largest downward contributions came from food, restaurants and cafes.
* Biggest upward contributions came form housing and motor fuels. 
* This is an encouraging print, pointing to possible dovish BOE. Following the print, futures now point to 71 bps of BoE cuts by year end, vs 67bps before the print.  
* EIA Crude Stock Data 
* Of course, the main focus of today is the Fed decision, and Powell‚Äôs press conference. 
* Dot plot will be released with the report. Could show we have taken another cut out of there.

"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket after market sold off yesterday**ANALYSIS:**

* We do have a few volatile events today. Firstly the ADP jobs numbers, which are expected to come in hotter than last month, whilst Powell talks in his testimony infant of Congress. 
* I think Powell‚Äôs talk will be important, but probably not the impact some may fear, as if you look historically at when Powell testifies, not as much movement as other speeches by Powell. Only thing I worry about is the fact that inflation ticked higher last month and could tick higher again this month if you look at Euro inflation reports for Feb as a guide. This could make Powel more hawkish than before. Still, Powell is generally v candid with his words so I‚Äôm not sure he will say anything which kills the market, but let‚Äôs see. 
* Regardless, if we look at risk reversal on DXY, we see it widen as traders continue to expect dollar to fall in medium term.
* Traders are mostly long GBPUSD, and very short USDJPY. LEt‚Äôs see. 
* EURUSD they are long as well, but less so. Let‚Äôs see. Moving towards 1.09 which is trader target but may see rejection there. 
* Regarding price movement yesterday, we saw a squeeze as traders very short volatility, which was triggered by bad news around TESla and AAPl. 
* This moved VIX much higher to 15, which led to QQQ sell off.
* Was. Bigger sell off than I anticipated, but signs of a major pullback still not there.
* Traders still very short vol, and we saw them sell it off towards end of the day, and today, VIX is lwoer at 14. 
* Yesterday was likely a buying opportunity rather than a major negative event. 
* We can get volatility from JOLTS today, they tend to be volatile for the market, but still no major signs of pullback. 
* Institutional money flow on SPY not pulling back one bit. THeyre still long. 
* On oil we can expect a bit more sideways movement below 80, as volatility skew quite flat, but I think fundamentals support move back to 80 on WTI as producers look to extend cuts to supply.

DATA LEDE:

* South Korea Inflation rate comes hot, at 3.1% vs 2.9% expected. Above previous reading of 2.8%
* MOM was hot 0.5% vs 0.4% expected
* Aus GDP (Q4) - Comes stronger than expected, at 1.5% YOY growth rate, vs 1.4% expected. Previous reading was 2.1%

* GERMAN exports and imports both beat expectation
* Exports MOM came 6.3% Up, vs expectations of 1.5% increase
* Imports were 3.6% up, vs expectations of 1.8% increase
* This points to improving domestic demand and international demand, although is one data point. 
* Eurozone Retail Sales (Jan)
* Retail sales were down 1% YOY, better than expectations of a -1.3% decline.
* MOM retail sales were more or less in line.
* So still declining YOY. This has been the case for more than a year. Not great, but in line with expectations. 
* ADP Employment Chnge (Feb) - Expected to have grown to 150k jobs placed according to official consensus.

"Chart adviceChart advice

New Trader here sitting on the sidelines today trying to learn. Based off my interpretations of this chart would a call @ 202.5 make sense ?  (RSI showing strength, mac D is bullish , Ema Crossed over and candle shortly after jumped my resistance) ",03-01-2024
"Trading from phone with limitsTrying to develop a strategy to get back into trading, my job changed and I have less available time on my hands and even less at a computer. Has a one developed a reliable strategy for mobile trading? Realistically I can chart up on Wednesday and Thursday, maybe Friday mornings. Used to watch price action/volume and trade spy/tesla 0-3dtes and exercise tight stops and going with the trend, not looking for break outs or reversals or yolos but scalping in 2-15 minutes adjusting my stop loss  as trades moved in my favor or against me and getting out quick. 

Is there any easy indicators/platforms to use on my phone besides Webull/robinhood?
What time frames should I utilize?
Should i look at futures where I might be able to trade in the late afternoon? 
Or should I just buy and hold shares until I can sell covered options on them? 

For reference I have a small account, just under 1k I had to withdrawal my gains last year when the wife lost her job and we had another kiddo.",02-26-2024
"Robinhood capital gains tax calculation vs personal trade journal significantly different?Hello, I always calculate my total gain or loss after each single trade and add that up month per month where I get my annual capital loss or capital gain. I calculated only a $6000 loss while Robin Hood tax paperwork calculated a loss of about $20,000. I usually trade the same stock Tesla over and over again I currently hold Tesla stock, I do puts and calls also. I had about 50k in wash sales. Is there anyway Robinhood is off or am I off?",02-24-2024
"I'm a full time trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket 02/21**ANALYSIS:**

* Firstly, NVDA earnings are today. 
* Bloomberg is showing an 11% predicted volatility on earnings, as shown below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6](https://imgur.com/a/C1nuTr6)  
* NVDA is lower in premarket on continued profit taking, but we can notice a few things. Firstly, skew, which was pointing sharply lower has now reversed upwards, as IV in OTM calls increases. 680 was a key gamma level where traders tried to buy the dip from yesterday.   
 As we know earnigns are a risk. Earnigns when the stock is up 50% in the last quarter are an even bigger risk. We saw that in other earnings reports, like Google‚Äôs where good earnings were still punished based on valuation. 
* Bulls on NVDA are for the most part holding their positions.
* This is the net gex profile for NVDA, skewed mostly to calls still on all expirations. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE](https://imgur.com/a/IlFyzTE) 
* On the 1 week to expirations, we can see more hedging for the earnigns. This clears up and the profile is again biased to calls when you look at monthly expirations. So traders hedge into earnings s that makes sense, but outlook still bullish. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8](https://imgur.com/a/hzs6fu8) 
* Key levels for NVDA are:
* Call resistance at 700, although lots of calls on 750 too
* Put support is at 640
* Put support from 0dte options is at 650
* These will be key levels going into the earnigns print. 

‚Äî‚Äî

* China points higher today as markets react to the cutting of 5 year rate yesterday. We noted on weekend that it seemed skew for Hong Kong was pointing higher and we could see calls building on 17k. It seems that traders are still expecting 17k to hit. 

A look at Oil:

* Spot price falls at the moment, as volatility continues as traders buy ATM puts to hedge for volatility.
* However, we can see from skew that there is a bullish divergence there on Brent. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa](https://imgur.com/a/xtjaHfa) 
* Volatility continues due to the hedging and the evercahgning geopolitical landscape, as well as ever changing Fed expectations. 
* But overall, outlook still looks bullish. 

A look at BTC\\

* Looks like we can be seeing a local top here. IV in OTM calls is reducing, block trade flows also reduce. Skew points lower. May see some correction. 

A quick look at indices then:

* Volatility skew does point down as traders hedging with put options, but money flows from hedge funds hit new high yesterday. Funds are buying the dip, and not expecting it to last in medium term. A lot in the short term will depend on NVDA though. 
* Finally, if we look at Mag7 skew, we do see signs that market can continue to price correct. 
* We see Mag7 skew lower, which often leads the market. Traders are seeking some protection from the volatility in short term. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* KEY IS FOMC MINUTES WHICH IS RELEASED 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET CLOSE. 
* Japan tankan business survey gives first negative reading on business sentiment since April 2023.

* Imports fell more than expected, by 9.6% vs 8.4% expected.

* Australia Wage Price index:FASTEST PACE OF RISE In 15 YEARS. 
* YOY comes 4.2% vs 4.1% forecast. Last quarter‚Äôs data revised up to 4.1% from 4%.

* UK Record budget surplus for January:
* UK Chief secretary says that they still won‚Äôt speculate if tax cuts are affordable or not in the budget. 
* US mortgage demand numbers:
* Mortgage demand takes a hit, interest rates cross back over 7% on reduced rate cut expectations pushing up bond yields. 
* EU Consumer Confidence NUmbers:
* Later we have FOMC minutes - likely reveals more of what we know, continue to explain that we need to see more of the same data to be confident of cuts. Slight hawkish tone probably. 
* FED SPEAKERS: BOSTIC speaks, as does Bowman.

* UK market down 1%
* Gold higher again on softer dollar and Middle East geopolitics - 5th consecutive green day in a row. 
* OIL: down 0.8%. Little bit of correction here, as was trading 78.5 yesterday. Volatility is persistent but skew keeps higher, just with more hedging.

"My strategy is too simple and too good to be true when automated.Hello, my strategy is very simple. It's about price action and riding with the trend.

Although I have always been struggling with the emotions and psychological aspect of trading (waiting for a setup is always the hardest part), it never failed me to give good results when I'm manual trading.

So just yesterday I tried prompting ChatGPT to code my strategy - which is a very simple strategy utilizing some default indicators from TradingView. Honestly, I'm not really surprise of the results because when I manual trade, it really works everytime.

Here are the results for the different instruments and different timeframes:

&#x200B;

All trades started from 2023 - current.

Timeframes: 1m - 5m - 30m - 1H

STOCKS: TESLA - [https://imgur.com/a/rZ1lvZT](https://imgur.com/a/rZ1lvZT)

FUNDS: SPY - [https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe](https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe)

CRYPTRO: BTCUSDT - [https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe](https://imgur.com/a/uBJoCpe)

INDEX: SPX - [https://imgur.com/a/j7B2Nsi](https://imgur.com/a/j7B2Nsi)

&#x200B;

The strategy does not use SL/TP. It exits a trade if an opposite signal is generated, I think it's what caused the drawdowns. I'm still analyzing how I can utilize SL for this strategy. Of course I use SL/TP on manual trading. In this 'automated version' I think it's profitable because there's no emotions/psychology involved at all.

I developed this strategy on XAUUSD - 1m mainly for scalping, refined and reviewed it every weekend. Implemented it on higher TF and it works.

Now, I know it's not 100% reliable and I'm asking for your suggestions how to make sure the results are reliable. I also don't have access to deep back testing yet. Do you also know a way to convert this pinescript code to MQL5? or make an expert advisor out of it? Thank you!

&#x200B;

EDIT: I manual trade with it. This is my strategy, just automated. I'm just taking a break from trading because of my emotions and psychology. I wanted to know what will be my strategy's results if there's no emotions involved lol.

"You need to give stocks room to breathe.Day trading is a lot more difficult these days. 

I want to share my tesla trade this morning. 

https://imgur.com/a/94xgnrq

Tesla was weaker than the market down 2.5% gapping down, and fits my short gap down strategy. I enter short at 185 break, and I'm rewarded 1.4 Points. I take some profit at 1 point mark, and but then look what happens a giant green candle forming brand new highs instantly...

Why did this happen? to be honest it's impossible to truly tell, but a lot of people put their stops at the highs, that green candle would have stopped out many many short traders instantly.  I held what was left of my position, and watched it dwindle back down to new lows. 

This is why day trading is the worlds most failed profession, these things happen for absolutely no reason other than pure algo fuckery. 

While reading the tape I saw so many people going long on that 1 candle, not knowing it was a bull trap, and saw the same tape selling it back down. 

Stocks need room to breathe, they do so much nasty moves like this just to scare retail traders. 

Less Size + More room = better profits.",02-02-2024
"Does anyone day trade tsll/tslsor trade tesla directly? I am seeing tsll or tsls have big bid/ask ratio differences such as a 5 cent difference would translate to an immediate loss 0f almost 100$ if you buy 20k worth of shares. 

Are these instruments worth it, or should i just avoid them and directly trade tesla stock?

P:S I am not considering options",01-31-2024
"Whats wrong with not selling at a loss if you have a good stockSo, since i started trading stocks, mostly blue chips such as tsla, amd, tqqq etc. I have been not honoring my stop losses, because my theory is even if my current thesis turned out to be wrong,  eventually my underlying will recover at some point, if not today than maybe tomorrow. So far this has not caused me any loss, as i just hold out until it recovers. The only problem is that i might have to hold it overnight, or a day or two, so it ends up becoming a swing trade.

With options i do understand you have to sell out immediately if your thesis doesnt play out because of expiration, and theta decay etc. But whats wrong if i buy 30k worth of tesla, and when i was hoping for it to go up, it instead goes down. It will eventually recover right? What is wrong with this strategy?

Even today i bought tqqq when rsi was low and price was below all indicators. I was waiting for recovery after buying but it didnt happen and it has been chopping and even down a little since i bought it 45 mins ago. But eventually it will recover, and then i can sell it at a profit ",01-30-2024
Can someone help me understand this?I‚Äôm fairly new to trading and learned quite a bit from this sub and YouTube. But I was watching a stream of trader from last year and they were swing trading Tesla on top of the day trades they were doing. But I don‚Äôt understand the price of Tesla. From what I gathered the highest Tesla has ever gone was around $409. So why does it show it so high? Something I‚Äôm missing? Thanks!,01-30-2024

1x Tesla is currently a horrendous value play in the short term to medium term due to speculative long term growth catalysts.

2. Tesla was expected to grow 50% over year next year. 

3x Cars overpriced as shit compared to increasingly similar market counterparts. Hyundai Ioniq and Ford get similar milage

4x) Growth estimates started changing sometime in q3. Now currently expected 15% growth in revenue. Possible

5x) Other cars are expected, to grow fast in self driving.

6) Used cars saturating market.

7)Macro risks - CC/student loans(payments just started) at all time highs. Unemployment ticking up. Market at all time highs carried by chips. Fed rate hike lag effect.

Any Day Trade favorites?I use benzinga and have tried many different scanner setups but it seems it would be better to have a few favorites to monitor and trade. I'm not in a position to trade a 1000 shares of Tesla so something in reason would be great to hear about. Thank in advance!!,01-05-2024
"Simple Question for a YT traderI'm asking you guys because I doubt the YT will answer me.  


So the author is saying he's risking $500 and getting back risk/reward 4.91? I've been trading stocks and options. Tesla stock is selling for $267.23, and it has sunk to $265. How does he get back 4.91 his risk? If trading stocks, that's 2 shares and you get back $4 bucks. What is he trading?

"I'm a professional money manager and this is what I'm watching/ expecting for the week ahead.  
**Some Expectations:**

* Low volume during the week due to Holiday season. 
* Nothing really on economic calendar this week at all + low volume = expectation of relatively flat movement.
* No major headwinds so unlikely to see big correction this week, from a fundamental perspective. 
* Next real significant economic development will be the FOMC minutes on 3rd of Jan, and even that will probably send the dollar lower, pushing markets higher.  So not expecting sustained correction in the very near term.
* Likelihood is that any dips will be bought and market will remain around current levels for now.   


**A look at some of the Options data to reinforce these expectations:**  


* EURUSD Skew at highest level of the year. Traders continue to bet that EURUSD will breakout. I personally had 1.10 as a price target on EURUSD but the active 1.11 strike tells us traders want 1.11.   
[https://imgur.com/a/xRK9bWq](https://imgur.com/a/xRK9bWq)    
The lack of data this week and risk reversal on DXY falling, pointing to continued drop in dollar means I won‚Äôt be surprised if 1.11 hits.   

* SPX skew is relatively flat. This tells us traders are not expecting a big move in either direction. Simply due to the fact of so little being on the economic calendar.   
Skew has lowered a bit, due to spike in VIX, but weak dollar means that volatility is not lasting in markets.  
Tells us dips are likely to be bought.  
   
[https://imgur.com/a/LHI1Srn](https://imgur.com/a/LHI1Srn)    

* Slight weakness in DOW Skews vs SPX skews. More hedging activity there. So if there is likely to be any weakness, Dow will probably underperform other indexes.   

* Tesla EXPECTATIONS FROM Skews (just because I know the retail audience Loves Tesla):  
Bullish imbalance tells us sentiment is positive around Tesla. But the bullish skews lowered, so probably see some chop this week. May move higher after Year End.  
[https://imgur.com/a/2DkrGYP](https://imgur.com/a/2DkrGYP)    

* NVDA EXPECTATIONS FROM SKEWS:  
500 Gamma wall seems a strong resistance, unlikely to break in short term.   

* ***Fun fact, is the first time since 1997 that not a single company will report earnings during the last week of the year.***   


  
**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî CALENDAR/ CATALYSTS ‚Äî‚Äî**   
**MONDAY:**  


* The only thing I was watching today was my Yorkshire puddings, to make sure my brother in law didn‚Äôt steal them.   

* Ueda was talking earlier, with key highlights being that he said the prospect of achieving sufficient inflation rate isn‚Äôt enough yet and stressed the uncertainty involved. Said cannot predetermine when to raise policy.   
Most of this is already known to the market, so no real movement in USDJPY   


**TUESDAY: (Boxing Day, so bank holiday for many countries. Expected to see low volume):**  


* US House Price index - Will probably show a MOM change of around 0.8% imo. 
* US 2 year auction - Will probably send 2 year yields lower, with better than expected demand.   


**WEDNESDAY:**  


* JAPAN - BOJ will release their version of the fed minutes, from the meeting where they dovishly held rates stable, against expectations of a hike. My expectation is that this will probably send JPY lower as they reinforce their commitment to ultra easy. USDJPY to prop up  

* US - 5 year auction. Similar expectation to the 2 year auction the day before.   


**THURSDAY**:  


* JAPAN - Retail sales.   

* US - Jobless claims - Expectation for it to come out slightly under forecast, due to Holiday seasonality.   


**FRIDAY:**  


* SPAIN - inflation Rate preliminary reading for December. Significant as Spain CPI tends to be a leading indicator of Eurozone CPI.   
",12-26-2023
"I'm a professional (news driven) trader and these are some of my notes from premarket  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn‚Äôt much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion.   

* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what‚Äôs not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn‚Äôt much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it‚Äôs hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn‚Äôt to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren‚Äôt fortune tellers, especially when there‚Äôs little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn‚Äôt put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**

* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday‚Äôs post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you‚Äôd have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
**TODAY‚ÄôS DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
* One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It‚Äôs a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
PCE revisions too
* note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won‚Äôt move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* **US Jobless Claims**  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession ‚Äúmaterialises‚Äù.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don‚Äôt follow other markets, it‚Äôs interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

"I really don't understand/vent.I hear everyone talk about having a plan and they follow but I don't even know where to begin, everything is so volatile in the market.  I'm trying to do supply demand zones but when I think it is correct it isn't.  I'm just frustrated, and yes i lost a little bit a money today but lost a lot on paper.  Mainly just angry that I don't have anything that is black and white and I don't see how to develop something so black and white.  And yes I'm mainly posting this to get out my frustration with this week.

I'll give an example, today TSLA I put in a Call for 255 from the beginning leg up. Waited for it to come down, it did bought the call and took profit.  This also worked for MSFT for me today as well.

But man my play on SPX ate me alive,  I was looking to buy the call when it dipped only for it to blow down past it and keep going.  I am not sure what else to look at to help.  I mean did anyone else see the sell off?  Is SPX not something good to apply to this strategy (sorry about that)

"20/12 I'm a professional trader and these are some of my notes from premarket.**I want to start this post by clarifying some of my comments in yesterdays post, and responding to some of the user comments there.**

* When I said the market looks like it can be topping out, I am in no way saying I am a bear, nor am I saying I am short on the market. This is the US stock market. Obviously, in the long run, it is ultimately going to go up, and break highs. To clarify, I am still long the market. What I was saying was that barring a catalyst, which it doesn‚Äôt appear there is in the near term, I do not see a sharp move higher. I am not saying the market cannot move 0.4% higher etc day to day. It can, especially when there is nothing on the economic calendar in way of headwinds. The market is moving on optimism and can continue to move in the direction it is, especially when VIX is so suppressed. What I am saying is that if you look at the economic calendar, there‚Äôs not much this side of the new year to help push it higher forcefully.Instead, when you look at certain factors which I will break down here, it seems likely there will be some short term correction, before it again moves higher.Firstly, Mag 7 trading near resistance, which it will have to break. E.g. NVDA rejected at 500. AAPL rejected at 200. Obviously a news story can break these resistances, but trading right against them, makes it more likely for them to come down than go up.Same can be said for indices, with SPX just below all time highs, which will probably act as a resistance.
* Secondly, look at market breadth. More than 90% of stocks are trading above their 50 day Moving average. This makes sense to be honest, when you consider the rate cut optimism. But at the same time, if you look at the last 3 instances that this has happened, in each of them, the market has done short term corrections. The last time that it was able to reach a level where market breadth was at 90% and still move higher was in 2021. To be honest, I do not see enough similarities in the economic picture today to in 2021 to suggest this will happen again now. Interest rates are much higher, economic growth is slowing, consumer is holding up but there‚Äôs still uncertainty as to how long it can.
* For this reason, I see it as more likely than not that there will be short term correction before it moves higher again.
* I am still long the market. We operate a long only fund, so we never short. What we do do, is fluctuate our cash position to reflect the headwinds and tailwinds in the market, or you can say, the risk/reward in the market. Right now, I have trimmed my positions, and have closed my swing trades/active trades. I still have my passive positions all running. To this end, if the market moves higher for whatever reason, and I am proved wrong, I am happy, because my passive positions are doing well. If it price corrects, I am also happy as I can put my swing trades back in and utilise my cash position. This is what trading is all about in our strategy, using the cash position to hedge ourselves such that we benefit if the market goes up, or comes down.
* *I will now continue with the normal posts:*

**What happened yesterday, and some of my trades from yesterday:**

* Was off the desk yesterday, due to family bereavement.
* From what I can see, market continued to push higher from open. SPX is now 0.6% below all time high, whilst DJI and Nasdaq closed at all time high.Dollar was lower, whilst bond yields were flat.
* Only order I placed was for a small day trade in ARRY, entering at 18, for 2.6% gain, after its rating was cut by analyst.
* My sell order on short term trade in AVAV also executed at 130.

&#x200B;

* ***Because I was off the desk yesterday specifically, I will insert a section here on general market conditions, for those who want a bit of a summary, those who don‚Äôt can skip.***
* Market breadth continues to increase. The QQQ Equal weight, which negates the heavy weighting of the Mag 7, has moved from 52 week low to 52 week high across last month and a half.40% of stocks on the S&P are now above 70 RSI
* Goldman Sachs custom indices of unprofitable and heavily shorted stocks up 12% in last week, which tells you people are short covering and continuing to move into those stocks which have potential to run up with rate cuts.
* Discretionary stocks now at their highest level of outperformance vs Staples since January 2022.
* Put interest still very low, traders are chasing not hedging.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî EARNINGS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* FEDEX earnings: Was trading at 52 week highs going into the print, up around 20% from last earnings, which puts pressure on the earnings being good.
* EPS of 3.99 missed estimates by 5%Revenue of 22.2b was down 3% yoy, and missed estimates by 1%Express Revenue still not picked up in last 4 quarters.
* Continues to see less shipments. Package volume down YOY. Perhaps less benefit from the UPS strikes than expected. Bit disappointing.Continuing on efficiency and cost reduction program (DRIVE). Cost reductions of $1.8bTo this end, cost per packaging declined 2%, due to lower line haul expense, and better last mile productivity.Demand remains uncertainBuybacks on stock of $1b in FY 2024
* Guidance:Cut full year revenue guidance - to fall single digit %, vs previous outlook of flatEPS guidance fell short at 17.75 at midpoint, miss consensus by 3%
* Conclusion:Yes margins expanded on lower revenues to help bottom line, but operating margin still fell short of expectations. Package volume decline showed limited benefit from UPS strikesNot enough has improved at all to justify how high it is trading.
* Overall, 5/10. Not terrible, but not good enough vs where its trading. Actually cut full year guidance, vs last quarter, when stock price is 20% higher.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî DATA LEDE ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* **JAPANESE BALANCE OF TRADE DATA -** Imports fell more than expected, whilst exports were more or less flat.
* This in theory should prop up the Yen as less imports means less selling of JPY. Seems to align with when Yen started going up last night, although the move is partly price correction from yesterday‚Äôs drop.
* **UK CPI (Nov) -** As noted in my Sunday post, I expected it to come in soft in line with US, and other European peers. GBP to fall slightly.
* This proved correct, as it came in well below expectations at 3.9% vs 4.4% expected.Core also fell to 5.1% vs 5.6% expected. Lowest core reading and headline reading in more than 2 years.
* MOM move was deflationary.
* This result is good for UK economy. Whilst Bailey at last meeting was signalling higher for longer, and UK and US situations are different, this datapoint shows that UK are starting to catch US up on inflation fighting front. May see rate cuts sooner than expected in UK.GBP falls on this, as it signals BOE can maybe move more dovish than before.
* **US - Consumer Confidence (Dec)** \- After market open, so hold early trading in anticipation of this.
* **US - 20 year bond auction**. Can move bond yields which can influence markets. Likely will see decent demand which will keep bond yields lower.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FOREX ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* GBP moves lower on soft inflation numbers, which suggests BOE may be able to be more dovish than first thought.
* Yen doing some price correction after yesterday‚Äôs move lower. Also moving higher as Japan plans to issue more government bonds in 2024, increased demand for Yen.EUR lower slightly, in sentiment with GBP
* Note: Am holding GBPUSD as I believe that the BOE will hold rates higher than the Fed. Today‚Äôs inflation surprise does bring that into question a bit, but still think BOE will be more hawkish than Fed. I had trimmed a tiny bit ahead of the inflation print, so will put that back in soon.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MARKETS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* DJI hit new all time highs in premarket again, near 37,600 then pared gain as European markets sold off after open.
* SPX and NASDAQ similar story. Mostly flat in premarket. We expect this to continue, as barely any news catalysts around, VIX is suppressed, and GEX is very high which tells us volatility will be lower.
* GERMAN market quite flat, rejected at 16,800 today.
* UK at 3 month high following inflation data which fuelled rate cut bets.
* NIKKEI higher again on dovish BOJ yesterday as they signal ultra easy monetary to continue
* HKG50 opened higher, around 16,750 then sold off the gains, down 0.77%
* Oil moving higher by 1% in premarket. Continues higher on Red Sea complications. According to the downtrend I have drawn, which I think it will eventually break to the upside, oil is now close to the top of the downtrend, and may on a technical analysis basis do some correction here. My near term price target for oil overall is 80 though.
* Bond yields slightly lower in premarket today, which can support equities. But it‚Äôs only marginally lower so likely to have no impact.  10y lowest since July

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OPTIONS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* GEX continues to grow - which lowers volatility4800 still sticky strike. 0dte tells us this is likely to be the max range today.HVL at 4645, 2.3% below spot.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Didn‚Äôt read too much as was off the desk yesterday. Here‚Äôs what I did read.
* DataTrek review 30 day rolling correlations of Daily returns on SPX vs individual large cap sectors, to suggest that the current rally has around 1-2 weeks left to run. They suggested that past that, market optimism would have pushed too far too fast.
* Bank of America‚Äôs fund manger survey yesterday showed equities saw largest inflow since October 2022. Tech saw the biggest inflows, industrials saw the biggest outflows. Dont; take too much notice of this inflows/outflows news. Ultimately, Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 9 straight days of gains.
* Bank of America also put out a piece saying that although credit card delinquencies have risen sharply over the last year, households on average remain flush with liquid assets. This is something we knew as Black Friday sales showed increase in Buy now pay later.
* Societe Generale: Market finds it easier to price monetary policy impact (rate cuts) than impact of inflation trends on margins. Last year, they misplaced hikes, vs impact of inflation on profits. For 2024, could be the other way around. AKA they are saying markets are probably pricing too much cuts.
* Unicredit - ‚ÄúCurrent enthusiasm seems somewhat exaggerated from short term perspective, and setback is highly likely‚Äù. Positives are priced in.

&#x200B;",12-20-2023
"I'm a professional trader and this is some of my notes on what's been happening in premarket.Note: I tried to take on some of the feedback from yesterdays post and provide a bit more analysis, although I keep some more back for my personal notes. Hopefully you can find value in this post though.

**What happened yesterday, and thoughts on this:**

* Yesterday, SPX and Nasdaq made marginally new highs, whilst Dow was flat. This despite fed officials continuing to try to walk back rate cut optimism.
* This move higher in SPX and Nasdaq was driven by Mag7 again, with exception of Apple and Tesla. We can see the mag7 dominance by the fact that QQQ rose by 0.43%, whilst QQQEqualweight was down for much of the day.
* Oil was higher on Red Sea disruption, particularly after BP said they would not be using the Red Sea Routes after Houthi attacks. This forces them through the Suez Canal which delays oil shipments by 2 weeks on average.
* Steel stocks pumped after Nippon Steel agree deal for X, although Senator Fetterman says he intends to try to stop the deal.
* Solar stocks notable losers as Sunpower raises doubts over its ability to continue as going concern, which dragged other Solar stocks lower.
* Vix remained suppressed around 12 which is supporting the market higher.

**My Thoughts:**

* Personally seeing signs that the market is topped out. Saw Tesla reached resistance near 260 but got rejected. NVDA now trading at 500, which I think is a psychological level that sellers will be sitting at, so would expect it to get rejected there over next few days. Apple trading near 200, which I think will be a psychological level sellers will be at. To be honest, I would have expected Apple to be down more than 0.85% with news of Apple Watch sales being paused and China accelerating their Apple ban in government institutions.
* Snapchat got a very bullish analyst upgrade but was flat on the day, which can be a sign madcaps are topping out too after a very bullish run.
* Nasdaq (IXIC, not NDX) now coming close to 15k which will see sellers sitting there.
* Other than lack of headwinds in the market in coming days in terms of data, I think market is close to key resistance levels.

**TODAY‚ÄôS DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:BOJ RATES DECISION - recall from previous reddit post, my expectation was for BOJ to hold rates despite speculation of possible hike.**

* Made no change to negative interest rate, holding benchmark at -0.1%Yield curve control unchanged.
* People had speculated that they would tighten which pumped up yen. Yen to now retrace those gains.
* BOJ spoke of ‚Äúextremely high uncertainties‚Äù and said more needs to be seen to determine if ‚Äúpositive wage inflation cycle is in place‚Äù.
* Seeing gradual improvement in inflation but still not in a position to be sufficiently confident.
* Didn‚Äôt remove the rhetoric about ‚Äúwon‚Äôt hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary‚Äù. Thats quite dovish

**ANALYSIS:**BEFORE SPECULATION THAT BOJ WOULD TIGHTEN, USDJPY WAS TRADING AT 147.22JXY was trading at 68.Probably needs to retrace close to back to this.As Yen falls, Japanese equities going to become cheaper, so Nikkei will likely pump for few days now.

&#x200B;

**AUSTRALIA RBA MINUTES - For meeting where RBA went back to pausing after hiking again last month.**

* Board considered whether to raise rates by 25 bps or to keep steady. Decided on pause.
* Will continue to analyse the data to determine future policy.
* Some encouraging signs on inflation that need to continue.

**ANALYSIS**:Not much to these comments to be honest. Continued data driven rhetoric.**US** 

**BUILDING PERMITS AND HOUSING STARTS DATA COMING.**

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî FX ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Yen lower, propping up USDJPY. USDJPY was trading at 147 before speculation of tightening. Since that didn‚Äôt materialise, USDJPY needs to retrace.
* Money rotating out of yen into other currencies like AUD, GBP etc
* Note Risk reversal on dollar index has touched lowest since 2020, and options pointing to substantial drop in USD. This would support equity markets.
* Note: Dollar and US equities are most inversely correlated since May - Can watch for some correction there.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî OPTIONS ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* 4800 remains sticky strike
* Record Call skew - Bullish.
* Single Digit implied Vol
* CTAs moving supporting on Brent Crude now - algorithmic strategies supporting oil

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî MARKETS OVERVIEW ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* Markets: Flat as you would expect in premarket when they are trading at all time highs and there‚Äôs little macro catalysts to drive them notably higher right now.
* NIKKEI: Japanese stocks pumping after ultra easy monetary policy maintained for foreseeable future. Makes yen lower and Japanese equities cheaper
* GER40:Majority of sectors slightly green.
* HKG50: NOTE: I‚Äôm holding positions in the HKG50. I think it‚Äôs undervalued and people will rotate from US equities into HKG at some point.
* OIL: Flat this morning after pushing yday, although it did pare those gains when US said they will help to safeguard Red Sea vessels. Launched a task force. This reduces risk premium and made oil fall again.Yields: Flat, slightly lower

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

* PIMCO SAYS THEY THINK UK WONT ACHIEVE SOFT LANDING. Said they are betting against GBP. Said UK consumers feeling brunt of interest rates more than US as less on 30 year fixed mortgages.
* MS‚Äôs MIKE WILSON SAYS US EQUITIES HAVE GREEN LIGHT TO MOVE HIGHER. - Another Bear capitulates. To be honest, I see this as a sign of market topping out too.
* GOLDMAN releases paper saying UST yields are higher in short term, but near historical averages. Bullsh\*t report really. They‚Äôre high, lets be real. Highest since 2005.
* GOLDMAN‚Äôs SENTIMENT INDICATOR TICKED UP TO 1.1. Points to stretched equity positioning. Due a correction.

**‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Company Specific ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî**

Quite a flat premarket, not TOO much company specific news driving big moves. Piper Sandler put out some pieces in analyst reviews on solar sector.

* SEDG - Downgraded at Piper Snalder to neutral, price target at 105 (which is 15% above spot)
* RUN - Piper Sandler upgraded to overweight, raising price target to 31 , 72% above spot. Because RUN is more sensitive to cutting rates

"Stocks Trading 101: My Guide to the BasicsWhen I first started looking into stock trading, the sheer amount of jargon felt overwhelming. Over time, I realized that understanding these terms is half the battle. Here are some key concepts and terms that helped me make sense of it all.

Stock: A piece of ownership in a company.  
  
Share: One unit of stock or a slice of the company pie.  
  
Broker: The service or app that connects buyers and sellers; I‚Äôve used platforms like Robinhood and TD Ameritrade to get started.

Bid Price: The most someone is willing to pay for a stock at that moment.

Ask Price: The lowest price someone is willing to sell for.

Spread: The gap between the bid and ask prices. Smaller spreads often mean more activity and easier trades.

Market Order: Buying or selling instantly at the current price.

Limit Order: Setting a specific price at which to buy or sell; I use this when I don‚Äôt want to pay more or accept less than a certain amount.

Stop Loss Order: Automatically sells to prevent big losses if the stock price drops too much.

Trailing Stop Order: Similar to a stop loss, but moves up with the stock price to lock in profits as the price rises.

Bull Market: When stock prices are generally going up.

Bear Market: When stock prices are falling.

Volatility: Measures how much stock prices go up and down, with higher volatility meaning bigger swings.

Liquidity: Refers to how easy it is to buy or sell a stock without affecting its price much. Stocks with high liquidity feel less stressful to trade.

Candlestick Chart: Shows price movements over a specific period with details on opening, closing, highest, and lowest prices.

Support Level: A price where a stock tends to stop falling and bounce back up.

Resistance Level: A price where a stock tends to stop rising and reverse.

Trend Line: Shows the general direction of a stock‚Äôs price.

Moving Average (MA): Smooths out price fluctuations to reveal trends more clearly.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): A company‚Äôs profit divided by the number of shares. Higher EPS usually indicates more profitability.

Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E): Shows how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of earnings. A high P/E could mean the stock is overvalued or reflect high growth expectations.

Dividends: Portions of profits paid out to shareholders, a nice bonus for holding the stock.

Market Cap: The total value of all a company‚Äôs shares combined. A useful way to compare company sizes.

Day Trading: Involves buying and selling within the same day. It‚Äôs fast-paced and demanding.

Swing Trading: Involves holding stocks for days or weeks to profit from short-term trends.

Long Position: Buying a stock and expecting the price to rise.

Short Position: Selling a stock you don‚Äôt own, hoping the price will drop so you can buy it back cheaper.

Risk-Reward Ratio: Balances potential losses and gains, with a 1:2 ratio meaning risking $1 to potentially make $2.

Diversification: Spreads investments across different stocks or sectors to reduce risk.

Leverage: Borrowing money to trade bigger, amplifying both gains and losses. I use it cautiously.

Margin: Money borrowed from a broker to buy stocks. Helpful but carries real risks.

S&P 500: Tracks 500 of the largest U.S. companies and is a good measure of the overall market.

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): Tracks 30 major companies and has a more traditional focus.

Nasdaq: Heavily tech-oriented, featuring companies like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon.",12-16-2024

"The Dow‚Äôs Surging2024 has been a wild ride for the markets. We've seen tech stocks taking a hit, while traditional financial giants like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are soaring. And then today, the Dow breaks an all-time high, shooting up more than 300 points. Big bank earnings are driving this rally, but something‚Äôs been nagging at me.

While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are basking in the spotlight, Tesla‚Äôs been struggling‚Äîdown 8.1% after rolling out their robotaxi. It‚Äôs got me wondering: Is the market getting too hyped on the banks while brushing off some of the underlying risks?

Sure, JPMorgan beat earnings expectations and raised its annual forecast. Wells Fargo? Another 5.6% gain. But when you zoom out, there‚Äôs still a lot of uncertainty hanging over the economy. The Fed's potential 25-basis-point rate cut in November could be the cushion these banks need, but it‚Äôs not a guaranteed win.

Honestly, I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Äîam I missing something here? The Dow's on a winning streak, and major banks are leading the charge. But with mixed inflation data and the tech sector‚Äôs rocky performance, should we be more cautious?

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Are the banks really as bulletproof as they seem right now? Or are there risks we‚Äôre not seeing in this rally?",10-11-2024

"Thoughts on nvda### High Demand for NVIDIA's GPUs

#### Key Drivers of Demand

1. **Product Development and Computational Tasks**:
   - **Chatbots and AI**: Companies use GPUs to power AI models for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other natural language processing (NLP) applications. The computational power of GPUs is essential for training and running these models efficiently.
   - **Scientific Research**: High-performance computing (HPC) tasks in scientific research, such as simulations and data analysis, heavily rely on GPUs for their parallel processing capabilities.

2. **Self-Driving Technology**:
   - **Autonomous Vehicles**: GPUs are critical in processing the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras in real-time to make decisions for self-driving cars. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and others invest heavily in GPU technology for their autonomous vehicle programs.

3. **Robotics**:
   - **Industrial Automation**: Robotics in manufacturing and logistics use GPUs to handle complex tasks, including real-time image recognition, object manipulation, and path planning.
   - **Service Robots**: From healthcare to hospitality, service robots rely on GPU-powered AI to interact with humans and perform tasks autonomously.

4. **Race Towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)**:
   - **Major Tech Companies**: Companies like Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft are in a race to develop AGI. This requires building and training extremely large neural networks, which demand substantial computational resources provided by GPUs.
   - **Market Advantage**: The first company to achieve AGI could gain a significant market advantage, driving intense competition and further increasing the demand for high-performance GPUs.

### Implications for NVIDIA

#### Market Position

- **Leadership in GPU Technology**: NVIDIA is a leader in the GPU market, known for its continuous innovation and high-performance products. This positions NVIDIA well to meet the growing demand across various sectors.
- **R&D Investment**: NVIDIA‚Äôs investment in research and development ensures it stays ahead of competitors and continues to deliver cutting-edge GPU solutions.

#### Potential for Growth

- **Revenue Increase**: The diverse and expanding applications of GPUs suggest sustained and potentially increasing revenue streams for NVIDIA.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Collaborations with tech giants, automotive companies, and research institutions can further boost NVIDIA‚Äôs market presence and revenue.

### Considerations and Risks

1. **Supply Chain Constraints**:
   - **Manufacturing Capacity**: Meeting the high demand may strain NVIDIA‚Äôs manufacturing capacity, potentially leading to supply shortages and increased prices.
   - **Component Shortages**: Global semiconductor shortages can impact the production of GPUs, affecting supply and pricing.

2. **Competitive Landscape**:
   - **Rival Technologies**: Competitors like AMD and Intel are also advancing their GPU technologies, which could impact NVIDIA‚Äôs market share.
   - **New Entrants**: Emerging companies in the AI and semiconductor space might introduce innovative products, increasing competition.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **AI Regulations**: As governments develop regulations around AI and autonomous systems, compliance could affect development timelines and costs.
   - **Ethical Implications**: The race towards AGI raises ethical concerns, including safety, job displacement, and privacy issues, which could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny.

### Investment Perspective

Given the diverse applications and high demand for GPUs, particularly NVIDIA's products, the company is well-positioned for significant growth. However, potential investors should consider the risks associated with supply chain constraints, competition, and regulatory changes. A balanced investment strategy, possibly including a diversified portfolio of tech stocks, can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the growth potential in the GPU market.",06-12-2024

I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell. Many stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones.

"How do you decide position size based on ticker?I‚Äôve only been trading SP500 & Nasdaq for awhile now but want to start diversifying my trades to multiple stocks/tickers.

But problem is, I don‚Äôt know how to position the size correctly for each ticker. For instance, Tesla is much more volatile than Pfizer, so should I trade with more cash on Pfizer and less on Tesla?

I‚Äôm currently looking at Beta and recalculating how many shares to trade based on the Beta value for each ticker.

Does anyone have a different way to gauge how much size to trade based on ticker?",03-18-2024
"Always factor in beta when trading?Do you guys always factor in beta (to position size correctly) when making trades? 

Backstory:

I have swing trades on Bank of America (BAC), Pfizer (PFE), and Tesla (TSLA) over last 2-weeks. I put the same amount into each trade and won on BAC and PFE, but lost on TSLA. Since the TSLA trade lost a lot more (higher beta), I am still net negative even though I have 2 out of 3 win rate over the last 2-weeks",03-16-2024

"09/02 Premarket Report - Everything I'm watching and analysing in premarket as SPX breaks 5k.**ANALYSIS:**

* We broke 5000 in premarket, which means that we are currently trading above the call resistance. Premarket trading isn‚Äôt the best indicator of true price action due to the lack of volume. So when the market opens, we will want to see SPX consolidate above the 5000 level. It will likely retest this level so we just need to see if it holds above. 
* We can start to see some more call interest building at 5050 and 5100 now as we approach monthly OPex. 
* We can see that here: 
* [https://imgur.com/a/yhA4dcp](https://imgur.com/a/yhA4dcp) 
* And with a different visualisation here: 
* [https://imgur.com/a/k49BUH6](https://imgur.com/a/k49BUH6) 
* We have shown before that the money flows into SPX reached new highs. Here is a different visualisation of this, from Nomura, which shows that asset managers are basically really really long on this market. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/gYRSZ6t](https://imgur.com/a/gYRSZ6t) 
* Look at the Skew on the Mag 7. 
* Very very strong, not looking like any pullback right now on the big boys.
* [https://imgur.com/a/rWu04dp](https://imgur.com/a/rWu04dp) 
* Money flows in SPX remain strong , we are seeing some signs of possible hedging by traders in QQQ. 
* The gamma is very very high again today, which tells us that again volatility should be slightly surprised, although we will have the CPI revisions released, which will be interesting if they show some hawkish surprises. Note the last revisions data did indeed lead to dollar strengthening and Yields rising. If we do get that kind of move higher, we will likely see some pullback as traders hedge going into CPI print next week.
* See the institutional research section to read about Morgan Stnaley‚Äôs prediction for the CPI next week. 
* IWM lastly, Trading above a key gamma level, skew points higher on 1 month expiration and 1 year expiration. Traders expect bond yields to fall and IWM to break higher. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/jKEvfek](https://imgur.com/a/jKEvfek) 
* Yes market positioning does still look bullish on this market, but I do want to share with you an alternative analysis from Goldman Sachs here. 
* Goldman note that ‚Äúwe are now seeing extremely bullish options activity in the collective Mag 6 names. This is something that we have seen 5 other times in the post covid era (looking back 3 years). WE note that if you look at forward returns after this occurrence, the 2-4 week forward return is negative‚Äù.
* We can see that in this graph below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/3pvrKge](https://imgur.com/a/3pvrKge) 

**GAMMA LEVELS TO WATCH: - plot these on your charting platform so you can track the price action against them.**

* SPX trading at 5013
* These are the key gamma levels:
* Gamma level at 5025
* My quant says max of the day expected to be 5031
* 5000 remains tech all resistance 
* Gamma level at 4975 below that,
* My quant says expected min of the day if we go that low is 4965. That marks the lower bound of the expected trading range today and we can expect a bounce from here. 
* QQQ:
* Call resistance remains at 440
* Myq quant says upper trading bounce of today will be 436.95
* Gamma level at 436 too.
* 435 is where the 0dte Call resistance is
* Below spot, key gamma level is at 430. 
* Below this, my quant says min of the day expected to be 429. That‚Äôd mark the bottom of the trading range if we were to fall that far. 

**DATA LEDE:**

* US CPI Revisions - markets will be looking to inform their thesis for the timing of the first rate cut. 
* This comes ahead of CPI next week. 
* Last time, the 2022 revisions showed that inflation progress wasn‚Äôt so great, which made yields jump and the dollar jump. 
* Fed‚Äôs Logan speaks later though

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
 **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH:**

* With CPI next week, let‚Äôs take a look at Morgan Stanley‚Äôs CPI prediction:
* [https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC](https://imgur.com/a/VdlgdWC) 
* They expect CPI decelerated to 0.26% MOM in January, below consensus of 0.3%
* Said they think core services was sideways and good decelerated. Energy prices will drop headline to 0.14%
* Bank of America‚Äôs put out mapper saying that Stock Rally close to triggering Sell Signal.

"Why is the buy and sell value on trading 212 not reflective of the price of 1 share?This may be a stupid question, but I am very new to this. On trading 212, if I look at Tesla for example. It says the buy price is $186.65 however if I choose to buy just 1 single share, it is valued at 29.37. Could somebody explain what I am not understanding? 

Thanks in advance!",01-31-2024
"I'm a professional news driven trader and this is everything I'm watching and analysing from premarket 25/01 including analysis of Tesla and more.To support more analysis like this, please join r/Tradingedge as well as r/Trading. 

**ANALYSIS:**

* Yesterday we hit 4900 like a brick wall and got rejected, a lot of algorithmic selling from that point brought us lower. 
* Looking at today vs yesterday, we can see that the call resistance still sits at 4900, it hasn‚Äôt rolled up yet to 4950 or above. We want to see the roll up of call resistance for us to be more bullish. 
* In fact, after 4900 got rejected yesterday, we can see that traders bought a fair bit of Puts 0DTE. On February expiration, we can see calls on 5000 and 4950 got sold, and puts got bought. So positioning bit worse, but still bullish. Money flows are strong. 
* If we look 0dte we can see big walls at 4880 as 0dte call resitance and 4845 as 0dte put resistance. These will act as sticky strikes, but obviously they are just 0dte so they can be broken by strong volume from GDP data. 
* QQQ positioning more or less as it was. Call resistance still at 430, which will act as a wall. 
* IWM we are seeing some selling of calls, as bond yields push higher. 
* Note that positioning today will be subject to the GDP print. A big surprise in either direction will clearly impact the market, as it will impact bond yields, dollar, and the chance of rate cuts. 
* We showed yesterday that the probability of March rate cuts has been directly driving dollar price action, and in turn the equity market. 
* We can see from the chart below that the reduction in rate cuts being priced was what directly correlated to the equity sell off. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZpQZLXO](https://imgur.com/a/ZpQZLXO) 
* Vix is pretty much sleeping at this point, so this is a good thing to watch as the number of rate cuts being priced and equity markets are moving inversely.   

* Furthermore, Tesla will weigh on Nasdaq a bit today. The report wasn‚Äôt great. Pointing to lower volume is not what investors want to be hearing, but that is mostly because their team is working on launch of next gen vehicle, or so they say. 
* I do think that we have to remember that the stock was trading at 260 at the start of the year. It‚Äôs already down 27% on that. I do think Tesla goes lower but I am not as pessimistic as other people on Reddit and social media.   

* A quick look at China, because China announced more supportive measures, this time for the property sector. 
* Call volumes on China are flying, after the announcement of stimulus measures this week. We can see that below. 
* [https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN](https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN) 
* I did look at the option profile for FXI, and saw a fair bit of selling of puts at 21. Positioning is looking much better. 
* Mainland investors aren‚Äôt chasing this rally though, but area actually selling it. Whilst we can see more of a squeeze here, and I am long China so I want to see that, I do think we need to see mainland investor sentiment shift before we see sustainable rally forwards.
* Along with the improved positioning on China, we can see AUD risk reversal points up.  
 Traders fully expecting 0.67 right now, as stimulus in china helps Australian trade. 

**DATA LEDE**

* IFO Report for Germany:
* Business climate was 85.2, lowest reading in a year and missed expectations.
* IFO expectations also came in light, and at the lowest level in over a year. 
* We can see the weakness visualised here:
* [https://imgur.com/a/GAYfHpW](https://imgur.com/a/GAYfHpW) 
* This report reiterates the growing weakness in Germany.   
 
* ECB Interest Rate decision. Expect the ECB to walk back some of thier dovishness. This hawkishness could push EUR higher.  

* Jobless claims and US GDP growth 
* Expectation for GDP is fora moderation to the more usual 2% vs last quarter‚Äôs anomalous 4.9% 
* Also watch the durable goods orders, expected to be 1.1%.

* HKG50: Slightly higher again, trading at the high fo the day yesterday at 16,200.

* [https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN](https://imgur.com/a/ZpHWjGN)

* Bond yields: slightly lwoer this morning, ahead of GDP but mostly elevated 
* Oil - Was higher yesterday, as US crude inventories showed a big decline, much more than expected. That distorts supply demand imbalance in favour of higher prices. Also we saw Russian seabourne crude shipments drop to 7 week low. Still, oil price flat ahead of GDP numbers. 

**FOREX:**

* EURUSD: Flat ahead of ECB meeting and GDP numbers from US, got rejected at 1.09
* GBPUSD: Flat ahead of GDP numbers from US, at 1.273
* AUDUSD: Flat below 0.66. Yesterday it pushed up, then pared most of the gains as dollar recovered and China pulled back. 
* Risk reversal on AUD is higher. Stimulus from China is boosting optimism. Traders expect 0.67 to hit. 
* DXY at 103.2, 103.8 is the key level to break on upside ahead of GDP.

**EARNINGS:**

**TSLA EARNINGS**

I bought like 250$ iShares World Equity Index Fund (LU) It includes Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon Com Inc, Nvidia Corp, Meta Platforms Inc Class A, Tesla Inc, Alphabet Inc Class A, United Health Group Inc and more but Apple has the biggest share in the fund.

"AAPL, TSLA, NVDA: What positioning data tells us to expect for price action in Short term.**AAPL:**

**Look at the skew below:**

[https://imgur.com/a/7Fszu74](https://imgur.com/a/7Fszu74)

Despite the bounce in equity prices, skew never really pointed higher. Sentiment remains subdued around AAPL. Negative analyst downgrades continued last week, putting pressure from week before.

Main option volume is buying OTM put options. Traders expect price to fall.

Gamma wall at 180. Call resistance at 200. Other gamma level at 190. Likely rngebound in 180 to 190.

**TSLA:**

We can see that the break of 220 has sent skew lower. 220 was a key level. next key level down is 200 which is the put support. 210 also a big strike and will be in play.

[https://imgur.com/a/q5h18n5](https://imgur.com/a/q5h18n5)

Call resistance moved down from 250 to 233.33 which is not bullish.

Positioning got worse on Tesla, but notice the orange line> money flows remain bullish. Hedge funds din't sell, still holding their positions long. I guess they expect recovery in medium term.

Main options im seeing are puts on 210. Fully expect 210 to hit maybe even 200.

200 game wall is massive though and can expect a bounce from there.

&#x200B;

**NVDA**:

Look at the skew below:

[https://imgur.com/a/aDg8NFJ](https://imgur.com/a/aDg8NFJ)

Skew index moving lower on both weekly and monthly. IV in OTM call options decreasing, which is causing volatility.

People re selling calls, will likely pullback.

Main calls being sold are 560.

Call resistance remains at 550, strong gamma level at 500, which it cn bounce from. below that, is 450 put support.

"Doubling Roth IRA annuallyI am putting this out there into the universe, so this post is for me really. 

I believe my goal from here on out is to double my Roth IRA annually. I honestly don't think this will be that difficult. I finally have my style nailed and think I am done looking for ""better"", and I handled this entire year well. 

One thing is clear, we are all at the mercy of the markets, I can't double an account in a garbage year and I have no issues with that, I will stay cash during this time as has been my strategy and I LOVE being in cash. I didn't double it in 2022 and I had an off year in 2021. But from 2017 to 2021 I did amazingly well and I was up 200% this year and I think if my goal is to just double the account from here, by the time I am 50 I will have more money than 99.9% of people. Isn't that good enough? 

I love the TQQQ, I think its an amazing instrument and my general rule is that if I cannot outperform the TQQQ then I may as well just buy the TQQQ. Well after doing some poking around I did nearly exactly what the TQQQ did lol. It was 209% for me a 207 for TQQQ, crazy to be so close! My strategy is trading long options, no crazy options strategy, just looking for moves in stocks and buying options instead, it does pretty well. I have to say though this last few weeks was all AMD for my account, if it weren't for that stock I would have underperformed the TQQQ. 

This leads me to maybe re-think my strategy and maybe just do the TQQQ? But I don't know if I can psychologically do this! I am so used to the hunt, the strategy and having somewhere to put my energy that I don't know if I could just sit and watch the indexes everyday without looking for Tesla or Nvidia or AMD. 

That being said TQQQ is already my default, so I put money into that and then sell that to buy my options. So maybe its just a fine strategy overall? 

Part of me thinks as my account gets over a million size may be a problem in certain options markets, I recently took an NVDA options position with like 21 calls and there were 20,000 calls sold lol. So obviously in some pools I am a small fry, but what about when I am trading 1,000 calls? In smaller pools that will be super large. At the same time I see places call out options trades like that out all the time thinking someone knows something. Maybe that will be me one day and if so will ""they"" come hunting for me in a way I am not used to. 

Or do I take size and just do the TQQQ? I don't think there will be a problem in there, with 3.3B traded today I think it'll be a while before I matter there lol. 

I really want to solidify my strategy, I am a dreamer and thinker and keep coming back to the same tenants after all these years. 

1. Market Cycle
2. Leaders
3. Breakouts
4. Options
5. Cash

If I just focus on that with TQQQ as my cash position during bull runs and actual cash when were not bullish I think that will be the key. The question is can I do it! Shit...how can I not do it, what the fuck have I been doing for 20 years if I don't perform what I have trained myself to do! 

All I do is double accounts.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/14talju)",07-07-2023
"regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans, sends valuation to $5bnElon Musk's company, Neuralink, which is developing technology to implant chips in human brains, is now valued at around $5 billion.

This valuation increase is due to some investors purchasing stock and the recent U.S. regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans.

The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.

Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.

After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.

**why is this important?**

1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested.
2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology.
4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink.
5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.

"Pre-Market Trading Report - Get Ready for the Day**Thoughts & Comments for Today, 4/19/2023**

Today as I said before, is historically a bullish day for the markets. I personally am expecting a green day for the markets, so please take everything that I said now with a grain of salt, as it is biased.

I do believe that the markets will come down over the upcoming months, and we will see a significant amount of instability in the price of general equities. I have personally started to hedge my account in preparation of this downturn and will continue to hedge my account accordingly when given an opportunity to do so. This is not a bad time to start exiting positions you lack confidence in but retain profits in, and this is not a bad time to start preparing to load up on cash.

A couple of positions I would recommend:

1. Start selling positions you lack confidence in
2. Set stop losses on all positions you do not want to hold until the end of the year
3. Purchase hedges either directly against your position or in indices like $SPY and $QQQ
4. Sell covered calls on equities you anticipate holding
5. Have cash ready to purchase and average down during the middle of the summer

"Tesla Stock downgraded to a ‚Äúhold,‚Äù looking for additional insights!Like the title says, Tesla Stock downgraded to a ‚Äúhold,‚Äù this morning and has been reported by numerous analysts, but I am looking for additional insights!

Berenberg analyst Adrian Yanoshik said investors should hold off on buying more Tesla shares for now, downgrading the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy""

Here‚Äôs the [full article ](https://news.yahoo.com/analyst-downgrades-tesla-stock-after-50-pop-130116787.html)(From Yahoo bc the Bloomberg Pro requires subscription)

Tesla's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 46 times, compared to 20 times for the S&P 500 and currently has a roadmap for expanding Tesla‚Äôs total accessible market by creating cheaper vehicles which feels good from an investor standpoint.

Aside from quarterly earnings that has been profitable, the odds Tesla continues to get downgraded feels high based on [prior reporting and valuations](https://www.pluto.fi/stock/TSLA) volatility. 

Any insights on steps is Tesla taking to maintain their competitive edge in the market, and how do they plan to address potential challenges from new and existing competitors? Looking at the performance of the stock alone, I‚Äôm not holding my breath but maybe holding the bag.",03-08-2023
Is Tesla having a pennant as a turnaround or a wedge as a continuation?,03-08-2023
"TESLA Short Trade Setup - Key Gap Fill Level = Retrace TargetHello Traders, here is a short trade setup for the beloved TESLA.

**To start,** the ideal short entry on a technical basis would've been at a pierce of $207 (Major Resistance) however I didn't create this post in time. It's still a great short setup and there is still plenty of room for profit, so don't worry it's not too late to enter.

**Short Setup**

* **Entry:** Current price, around $200.
* **Exit:** $141 ($170 if you want to play it safe)
* **$141 Take Profit Level:** *Gap Fill + .618 Fib = High probability of a retrace to this level.*
* **If price continues higher:** Add to short position at key resistance levels to average down.

**Short Thesis:** In general all signs point to the broader market reversing to the downside at some point in the near future. Once this happens we should see sentiment shift from euphoria (greed), to fear very quick. TESLA is a ""Risk"" asset and will be especially vulnerable to a ""fearful"" market sentiment and should see heavy selling once investors realize that they have been fooled and that the ""bottom"" is not actually ""The Bottom."" 

**In addition**, TESLA hit Major resistance at $207 after a massive move to the upside with almost no red candles in between. We know that TESLA is majorly overdue for a large pullback... the question is ""at what level will this pullback occur from?"" --- I believe that the pullback will occur from the $207 level, hence the reason for this trade.

Thanks everyone and I wish you all the best in your trading journey!

"Controlling Emotions with Position Size - Feedback Experienced Traders?Started trading a month ago, made almost 6% with SQQQ/TQQQ past month. 15 trades and 1 loser. I felt my confidence grow but now my confidence is messed with after a big loss, big loss due to not wanting to cut losses early and lose 1 of my trades to PDT rule.

Was getting so frustrated with PDT rule decided I'd go from 20% average position size to 200% using margin. Make it count, right? Would've made 6% with Tesla today but sold for 0.44% loss as it looked like it was reversing, so panicked and sold.

Is trading mainly about managing emotion? I wouldn't have panic sold a 20% position size but 200% with margin is like walking on tight rope. Should I switch to a cash account? Focus on slow and steady consistent growth which isn't very profitable or focus on big margin swing trades which I have poor emotional control over?

"Strategy Design Write-up no.3 - EMA/RSI combination v.1 Hey guys,

This is going to be another post on strategies that I have backtested and my thoughts on the strategy performance, as well as the backtest procedure and guidelines. I appreciate any and all feedback or suggestions you may have that may improve either the post layout, or the strategy design itself. Hope you enjoy this post.

**Part 1: The Strategy Ruleset**

https://preview.redd.it/xdh9he15y3091.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=19a924d46d6d4f41799daee742c64f58996e3218

So, in the last 2 posts I made, I used the exponential moving average, and the relative strength index indicators. In this strategy, I attempted to combine them to improve on each other.

This strategy is based upon a momentum crossover of the 8 bar EMA over the 13 bar EMA to the upside. The assumption here is also that a crossover of that magnitude brings a high RSI. The the exit criteria are as follows: Sell when the 13 bar EMA is below the 23 bar EMA, and the RSI is also less than or equal to 80. This should represent a change in direction.

**Part 2: The Assets Traded**

https://preview.redd.it/vcnkbjz6y3091.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=e67ed0091805f8b30a4e619177d40a5c65d82b94

I chose a relatively random selection of popular stocks. Following on from suggestions based on my previous strategies, I left Tesla out of the backtest to avoid ""survivorship bias"", or the fact that any test with Tesla in it is likely to be highly successful.

**Part 3: The Settings**

https://preview.redd.it/vgo1ith8y3091.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=39a9dcfbe504e47fbd3402146b0a3c7d6202b25e

Simple enough, similar to my last strategies.

**Part 4: The Backtest Scenario**

https://preview.redd.it/6w7moq9ay3091.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7b86f1cbce05e0ba9c27d21e686cc394f1b6a7

I set the backtest to start before the Covid crash, and to finish on the day I made this post. That gave over 2 years of data, which surely could be considered enough, even given the uniqueness of the market within that specific timeframe. Going on the hourly chart as well, would amplify the timeframe, as this would mean roughly 10 times as much data, over the daily chart. This timeframe includes many drawdowns in the market, which should heavily affect the results of the strategy if it is a poor strategy.

**Part 5: The Results**

https://preview.redd.it/0czx3evby3091.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b43573b146a33cf0f499b3fd06774626a542d672

Not bad. While a B is obviously less desirable than an A, at least the returns were decent. An annual return of about 22%, in a timeframe including the recent large drawdowns.

A closer look into the results:

https://preview.redd.it/2trwz3jdy3091.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=68c9cf9ba2db91483b09271e563af37a53c45844

Worse than buy and hold, but better than the benchmark. And a decent risk score.

One thing I wanted to investigate more was the low winrate (I spent a lot longer trying to figure this out than I should have):

https://preview.redd.it/g1z35gcfy3091.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e86111f931ed36adf1ebab7ef38c0254ea20903

There were pages and pages of the above, for each stock. It can quite clearly be seen that many of the trades were closed as soon as they were entered, a potential flaw in the design of the strategy.

**Part 6: Potential For Optimization**

* Different RSI settings
* Different exit criteria
* Greater amount of stocks chosen
* Different timeframe
* Greater length of backtesting period

"Quickly review the most recent 100 opens of a specified stock?I want to review a small portion of the charts of a specified stock for the most recent 100 days. My goal is to look at these charts to see if I can find a repeatable trend or behavior during a particular time period each day. Is there any software specifically designed to help make this task fast and efficient? 

For example:

Let's say I want to review Tesla, and my goal is to review the last 15 pre-market minutes as well as the first 15 minutes of market open. And I want to see this 30-minute chart for each of the most recent 100 trading days ...

Is there any software I can configure to do this relatively quickly and easily?

My thought here is that once I define the stock, the number of days, and the trading period, a simple click of a button would show me the same time period of the next trading day, then the next, then the next, etc., until I have seen all 100 of the most recent days.",02-23-2022

My original hope was to take i94 most of the way as the preferred route, but temps are looking worse and worse for EV roadtripping. Minneapolis has a high of around 10 degrees, Fargo 7, etc. My ABRP reference consumption is 2.03, but that‚Äôs mostly local driving. Highway is normally around 1.7-1.9 on non-freezing days..

I‚Äôm thinking now about taking i70 most of the way instead as it‚Äôs much warmer, but it‚Äôll add at least 5-6 more hours and requiring me to use some EA chargers. I‚Äôd rather take that and be safe than go 94 and be SOL because of the extreme cold.

"Review of taking my 2021 Chevy Bolt on a 300 mile road trip across California So I thought i would share my experience taking my 2021 Chevy bolt from Anaheim California to Merced California, about a 300 mile trip.
My car gets about 180 miles on an 80% charge, and I don't like to let it go below 30 miles remaining, which gives it about 150 usable miles on a 80% charge. As we all know if you charge to 100% it takes longer so for this trip I did mostly 80% charges.
I charged up in Anaheim before I left, then charged at a charging station in Santa Clarita near Six Flags to get me over the Grapevine.
Then I charged in Bakersfield, and finally in Fresno, and eventually made it to Merced. One thing I noticed was the charger availability once you get over the grapevine is much more sparse. This trip would have been five hours in a gas car, it took me nine hours to get there and 10 hours to get home. Beyond the time that it takes to charge there's also time factored in to get on and off the freeway, making each charging stop approximately an hour. I could make it in three charges rather than four but because of charger availability and mileage restraints I have to charge an extra time.
It cost me about $60 to drive there (I left Anaheim at 7 AM, so I was paying premium pricing). The drive back was only $29, I left at 11p so l paid all lowest tier pricing.
In conclusion, I'll never take this car out of the SoCal area again, it was not worth the time I wasted and how badiv mv bodv hurt from sitting in the car for that long. Next time I will take a bus or a train or fly or perhaps even rent a gas car. I wouldn't recommend taking an EV on a roadtrip over 100 miles or whatever your max is for one charge.

"Delayed level 2 charging at HotelsHello!

"A review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long road trip. A review of the BMW iX M60 after a week long loaner

I recently had the BMW iX M60 for a week as a loaner. I have driven most of the EVs out there, including another week long road tripper (the Mercedes EQS), currently own a Hyundai IONIQ 6, a BMW X5 and BMW M3. I decided to provide some info about my experience road tripping this iX M60 for a week and 700 miles with my family over the Christmas holiday while my wife‚Äôs X5 was in the shop. 

Spoiler: not terribly impressed! 

I did use ChatGPT to format this review a bit nicer and closer to a more traditional automotive review, hope no one is too upset but your reading experience is much improved trust me. 

2024 BMW iX M60: A Mixed Bag of Innovation and Compromise

The BMW iX M60 enters the crowded luxury EV market with the promise of blending BMW‚Äôs trademark driving dynamics with cutting-edge electrification. Positioned as a performance-oriented alternative to the likes of the Mercedes EQS SUV and Tesla Model X, the iX M60 seeks to redefine what a premium electric SUV can be. Yet, after a week of real-world testing, including a 700-mile road trip, it‚Äôs clear that the iX is both a showcase of BMW‚Äôs engineering prowess and a reminder of where the brand‚Äôs EV journey still falls short.

Charging Woes: A Pain Point for the Price

For an EV that commands a base price north of $112,000, charging performance is a glaring weakness. The iX M60‚Äôs advertised fast-charging capability of up to 195kW seems promising on paper, but in practice, it struggles to maintain consistent speeds. Over the course of our trip, the vehicle averaged an underwhelming 90kW at 350kW-capable stations, often dropping to 135kW or lower within minutes. This resulted in 40-minute waits to charge from 20% to 80%, a frustrating reality in a segment where faster charging curves are becoming the norm.

Comparatively, the Mercedes EQS and Hyundai IONIQ series‚Äîvehicles at vastly different price points‚Äîboth outperformed the iX in charging efficiency and curve stability. BMW‚Äôs focus on ‚Äúmiles per minute‚Äù metrics, rather than charging speeds, subtly acknowledges this limitation. While the iX offers respectable range accuracy, its slow charging dampens its usability on longer trips. These two other EVs will be the primary comparison against the iX M60 throughout this review as they are the two which I have also road-tripped and lived with for extended periods of time. 

Driving Dynamics: Power Meets Bulk

The iX M60‚Äôs 610 horsepower and 811 lb-ft of torque deliver blistering straight-line speed, particularly from a standstill. Yet, despite this power, the SUV‚Äôs 5,800-pound curb weight makes itself known in high-speed situations, where acceleration tapers off noticeably beyond 80 mph. The vehicle‚Äôs low ground clearance contributes to a planted feel, but the added heft becomes apparent in sharp corners and during braking, diminishing the agility typically associated with BMW‚Äôs M-badged vehicles.

Steering feedback, while precise, is devoid of engagement, but that‚Äôs to be expected in a vehicle of this class. The air suspension system helps maintain composure over uneven surfaces and allows for adjustable ground clearance, though the lack of intermediate settings between ‚Äúminimum‚Äù and ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù is limiting.

Interior: A Clash of Style and Substance

The iX M60‚Äôs interior is a mix of modern design and questionable execution. The materials, while visually appealing, falter in tactile quality. The Sensatec upholstery feels out of place in a vehicle at this price point, and build quality issues‚Äîincluding persistent creaks and rattles emanating from the center vents and infotainment mounting points‚Äîwere disappointing in a loaner with just 2,800 miles on the odometer.

Practicality is another sore spot. Storage space, an area where SUVs typically excel, is limited in the iX. Unlike competitors which make great use of the lack of a transmission tunnel to add more storage in the cabin, the iX does not and instead leaves a blank floor to have objects roll around on. Odd decisions, such as the use of piano black trim on the center console‚Äîan area prone to fingerprints and scratches‚Äîfurther detract from the overall experience. On the positive side, the driver‚Äôs seating position is excellent, and visibility is commendable for a vehicle of this size.

Technology: A Highlight with Caveats

BMW‚Äôs technological suite is a standout feature in the iX. The augmented reality navigation system, which overlays directional prompts onto a live video feed, is genuinely useful in unfamiliar urban settings. Camera systems are seamless and responsive, elevating the driving experience in tight spaces.

However, some features fail to impress. The Auto Backup Assistant is notably less refined than its counterpart in the Mercedes EQS, offering only limited functionality. The iDrive 8.5 interface is robust but hindered by a convoluted menu structure that places frequently used settings within a library of ‚Äúapps.‚Äù Voice recognition has improved significantly, providing a more intuitive alternative to manual adjustments.

Sound Design: A Novelty Worn Thin

BMW‚Äôs collaboration with Hans Zimmer to create ‚ÄúIconic Sounds‚Äù adds a unique auditory dimension to the iX‚Äôs otherwise silent driving experience. While the futuristic tones enhance initial impressions, they quickly lose their novelty. By the end of the first day, the synthetic sounds were turned off, allowing the iX‚Äôs excellent sound insulation to shine instead. 

Another poorly-performing component of the interior technology was the massaging seats which are significantly worse and less comfortable than the ones found in the Mercedes EQS. 

Final Thoughts: An Ambitious Yet Flawed Contender

The 2024 BMW iX M60 is a vehicle of contradictions. It excels in urban environments, where its quiet demeanor, technological sophistication, and rapid acceleration shine. However, as a long-distance EV, it stumbles. Slow charging speeds, subpar efficiency, and an uninspiring driving experience at higher speeds tarnish its appeal, particularly when compared to rivals like the Mercedes EQS and even the more affordable Hyundai IONIQ series. 

The iX M60‚Äôs interior craftsmanship and material choices also leave room for improvement, especially at this price point. While the exterior design grows on you, and thoughtful touches like carbon fiber add a sense of occasion, the overall package feels more like a work in progress than a fully realized flagship EV.

For those seeking a luxury EV with striking aesthetics and cutting-edge tech, the iX M60 delivers in parts. But for a true all-rounder, better options exist within the segment. ",12-28-2024
"Horror story buying used Tesla I was excited when I saw a 22' Model Y Performance with 24k miles for $32k. Apparently the car cost $63k new! Take note Echopark Autos is the selling dealership. 

Test drove the Y and saw 15% charge. I told the sales rep it needs a charge but he's clueless because they don't have a supercharger. The car would be charged on a slower charger at the dealership while I'm signing papers. 

I noticed during the test drive there is a very annoying rattle. I took the car out for a 2nd drive to detect the rattle and it disappeared so I was good and ready to move on. 

Negotiated a little and made a deal. I told the manager I am concerned that the battery is low. He said it's charging. 

I signed the paperwork and walk out to the charging car to see the battery is only at 13%. And there is no adapter or charging cable that is with the car. 

Told the sales manager and he said drive under 60 on the freeway and go to the nearest supercharger. I call Tesla support on my drive to charge and they tell me it takes 3-5 days to transfer ownership in the app so I'll have to use an adapter and a 3rd party charging site. I don't have an adapter! 

The battery is depleting now to 8% and I'm stuck in traffic. The rattle is back big time. My phone is now overheating on the Tesla charging pad and my phone won't charge with it case on. 

I turn my ass around and make it back to the dealership with a 2% battery. I tell the manager I'm done. Cancel the deal and give me my old car back. 

I'm very disappointed. The cars battery appeared to deplete quickly. My phone overheats while charging. The door makes a weird thid noise when closing. I wear readers (not glasses) and I had a very hard time reading the Tesla display.

I was excited about 3.5 second 0-60 times and a lovely Stealth Gray color with white interior. The price seemed reasonable but I'm not ready to go full EV. 

Next time I'll have all the cables ready before I make the purchase. Wasted a whole day off but I learned a lesson.  ",12-28-2024

"Audi EV Range Monitor Gauging Problems - can this be fixed?Greetings,¬†

My question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

I bought a new Audi 2023 Q5 Sportback in January 2023. ¬†I had had a Tesla Model X for 5 years, so am familiar with EVs, charging, range monitor, battery usage, etc.

I started having problems with the range monitor, although at the time, I didn't know that was the problem. ¬†I took the car to the dealer in Jan 2024, after less than a year of ownership, because I couldn't get it to charge to the regular 227 miles when the Audi app was showing 100%.

Just a few facts: I live in the balmy San Francisco Bay Area, and my car is always in my garage, which almost never dips below 50 degrees. ¬†My driving habits haven't changed. ¬†My use of the heater, AC, seat heater haven't changed. ¬†I live at 150 feet elevation and almost all of my driving is on relatively flat land. ¬†

I have brought my car to the dealer three times to fix this problem; they've had it for a total of 14 days. ¬†Their response to me:  no repairs needed 

Here is some of my recent driving data:

I drove 1.5 miles to the store and back. ¬†Here is what the ¬†range monitor showed during the 3-mile roundtrip:

Range shown ¬† Mileage

¬† ¬†204 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†20,434

¬† ¬†194 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 20,434

¬† ¬†165 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†20,435

¬† ¬†167 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†20,435

¬† ¬†202 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 20,437

¬† ¬†225 ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 20,437



Additionally, here are some examples of when I charged it on different days to 100%¬†

This is not affected by the temperature nor my driving. ¬†These are extremes, and I had this car for a year with out these wild vacillations.

Again, my question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

Thank you so much for reading all of this.

"Counting EVs on the highway for fun (it's not)Don't read this (or too much **into** this) unless you are as bored as I was. Every conclusion here is a small sample of observable stuff during a trip, so take it with a pinch of road salt.

**TLDR** : The Equinox EV is selling more than I thought, and Nissan EVs apparently can't go on the highway (joke, of course). Read more for my hot takes that will undoubtedly change your life.

I spent too much time doing this for its actual relevance. I'm off work and I do what I please with my own time, thank you very much

The other day I was a passenger on a pretty slow day on the highway with a couple of hours to go. Decided to count every visually-obvious BEV either oncoming or passing us (we were going 100 kph in our Bolt EV, so we didn't really pass anyone ourselves except some vans and the occasional slow semi). Driving on the A20 transcanadian highway in Qu√©bec, in cold temp (about -10 Celsius, so I expected to see less of short-ranged EVs). I thought I'd see something interesting during our 2 hours trip, and that it would be a fun (ok, not *very* fun, but I wasn't driving), objective way of figuring out popular brands and models... with some caveats :

* I probably did not recognize or spot every model, especially models that have ICE counterpart (ie : Soul and Kona)
* At some point we were in a traffic jam and some occurences might have been either missed or misindentified because of cars partially hidden.
* I did not include PHEV even if some are easy to recognize (ie : the Prius), because that would be unfair to other PHEVs that are very similar to ICE models
* I get distracted, sometimes. Let's assume it affected every model equally and move on.

Here's the list of EVs I spotted, by brand in alphabetical order (If I forgot a brand or model, it's because I didn't see it anyway) :

**BMW** : 2 total

* 2 unknown SUVs (I don't know their models but they were definitely EVs)

**Cadillac** : z e r o

* None

**Chevrolet (and Hummer)** : 40 total (#1)

* 21 (!) Equinox EV
* 7 Bolt EV (including ours)
* 2 Bolt EUV
* 6 Blazer EV
* 2 Silverado EV
* 1 Spark EV (!)
* 1 Hummer EV

**Ford** : 8 total

* 7 Mach-Es
* 1 F-150 Lightning

**Hyundai** : 28 total (#3)

* 16 Ioniq 5
* 2 Ioniq 6
* 7 Kona EV (+ maybe some that I couldn't verify if I had seen the EV or ICE)
* 3 original Ioniq

**Kia** : 18 total (#4)

* 13 EV 6
* 2 EV 9
* 3 Soul EV (very hard to distinguish from the ICE model so I probably missed a few)

**Lucid** : z e r o

* None spotted (and they are very rare in Qu√©bec overall. I think I've only seen one, ever)

**Nissan :** z e r o

* None (even though they are very recognizable, so I don't think I missed any)!

**Polestar :** 3 total

* 3 Polestar 2 (one looked different, but I don't know their models well)

**Porsche** : 1 total

* 1 Macan (fairly sure)

**Rivian :** 1 total

* 1 R1T

**Subaru** : 3 total

* 3 Solterras

**Tesla** : 31 total (#2)

* 15 model Y
* 14 Model 3 (some might have been model S, we were in traffic so it wasn't clear)
* 2 model S

**Toyota** : 2 total

* 2 BZ4X

**Volkswagen** : 14 total (#5)

* 14 ID.4

**Volvo** : 3 total

* 2 SUV (no idea which)
* 1 C40 (crossover, so easier to spot)

My hot takes :

* The Equinox was by far the most frequently seen EV with 21 occurrences (runner-up is the Ioniq 5 with 16 spotted, followed by the models Y and 3 respectively), which is kinda surprising for a 2024 model only (most model 3 were the older version, with only a handful being the updated design). As for the Ioniq 5 and model Y, we could expect most were from previous years as well. AFAIK the cheaper model (1LT) isn't even for sale in Qu√©bec yet, so I guess it's going to be popular when it does. Didn't expect Chevy to be the total leader overall in spotted EVs either, but it's really the Equinox carrying the team here. Mad respect for that single Spark EV driver going places (but not too far).
* Teslas are less frequent than I would have thought. The Supercharger advantage is less powerful in Qu√©bec since we have the Circuit √âlectrique (which is a public network that is quite reliable and affordable), so that might be why they possibly represent a smaller part of the EV pie in Qu√©bec.
* The Ioniq 5 is more frequent than I would have expected, since it's on the more expensive side. Not complaining, though, that car is beautiful imho. A similar observation for the ID.4, but this time because I had heard bad comments about it. Must be more popular than I thought initially (or maybe the people I know that were disappointed with it just didn't like/understand EVs at all)
* I really thought the Ioniq 6 was more popular. I guess it's not.
* I'm surprised to have seen exactly zero Nissan EVs, either Leaf or Ariya. Could it be linked to the cold weather? I've heard they perform poorly in the cold, but haven't looked into it much further than that.
* Expected more EV pick-ups, with their longer range and all. Only 3 during the whole trip, and only around cities and towns. Huh.

I've been looking at used Model Y's for a while now, and I've decided I‚Äôm gonna get one, particularly one with FSD due to vision issues that impair my ability to drive. (I can still see well enough to drive manually if need be, it‚Äôs just the fact that I‚Äôm legally (half) blind and have bad peripheral vision makes it difficult, especially in bad weather or at night.)

However, my family (more specifically my father) doesn't like them at all. 

He always brings up ""horror stories"" of Tesla's dying and breaking down all the time, poor reliability, cars needing expensive repairs, slow charging times/not being able to charge anywhere, bad build quality, etc.

I know at least some of it is inaccurate, but him saying all these bad things all the time is putting me on the fence. I'm just curious on how many of his statements hold up, if at all.

EDIT: Home charging is set up already for those wondering, due to my mother owning a Rivian. I‚Äôll most likely use that charger with the included adapter.

"Pre-Christmas trip report: we're adjusting our expectationsI've been driving an EV for three years now, but I still have a lot to learn. Hey, it's a process. Here's what I learned on our latest road trip.

**Expectation One: 200 miles at 18 degrees fahrenheit? Try 170... or less**

Recently I posted asking if it was realistic to expect 200 miles from a fully charged 2023 Bolt EUV in sub-freezing temperatures, around 18 to 21 degrees fahrenheit (around -7C). A Better Route Planner seemed confident, but I figured it was too good to be true.

The resounding consensus: ""hell no."" Most responses were in the realm of 170 to 180 miles on a full charge.

Since I knew I'd be driving with family members in the car, I carefully took this advice to heart. I carefully planned a trip in which each leg of the journey did not have to exceed 100 miles without a charge, with the goal of charging to 80% each time.

**Expectation Two: magic dock = long cord, right? Nope!**

On Saturday the 21st, for the drive north from Philadelphia, PA to Simsbury, CT, I planned to make three charging stops. I was pleased to see we didn't need the first one, which is lucky, since there was a long line at the East Brunswick Electrify America. We turned it into a quick bio-break and got back on the road.

For the second stop, we had planned to try a Tesla Magic Dock-enabled supercharger in  Woodcliff Lake, NJ. This proved to be a mistake.

Flashback to Thanksgiving: we tried our first Magic Dock in Harrison, NY. Apart from some drama due to the lack of a natural place to queue, it went great - the user experience of releasing the Magic Dock was smooth, and the cords were plenty long enough for any EV. So, surely all Magic Docks have long cords... right?

**Wrong! Only Rev 4 Superchargers have long cords.** Rev 3 Superchargers retrofitted with Magic Docks have the super-short cords that require you to block two chargers... which will not make you any friends when there's a queue.

Alas, by now my family was all in on the promised lunch at Bareburger, which I gotta recommend if you haven't tried it; we're still in mourning for the late, lamented Philly location. So there went an hour on the clock, with zero charging achieved.

At least I had planned for a backup option. Always have a backup charger lined up!

If you're curious, you can use [supercharger.info](http://supercharger.info) to filter for v4 superchargers only (thank you [ITypeStupdThngsc84ju](https://www.reddit.com/user/ITypeStupdThngsc84ju/)). But here's the thing... there are very few of them so far. So for right now, our new plan is to pretty much ignore the Tesla option entirely until they roll out more v4's and/or retrofit more long cords. Even though we do have an adapter. Unless we're desperate and/or it's not a congested holiday season drive.

**Expectation Three: there's a line, right? Well... sort of**

After lunch we went to our trusty EVGo at Nanuet Mall. Unfortunately there was a line. We sat in a quasi-queue for 25 minutes, the worst part of which honestly is the negotiation, the people running back and forth to explain their place in line, the folks who insist on making sure that one dead charger won't magically work for their particular car... it's hard to just put on music, tune out the nonsense and chill. But we managed.

**Expectation Four: at least we can charge at 50kw for a while? No?**

I understand that the Bolt is a slow-charging car. My previous car was a Leaf S Plus, and ironically, the Bolt charges even slower than that. And I'm OK with this... at normal temperatures.

But in very cold weather, the Bolt charges even more slowly, even while below 80%. And under the wrong conditions, ""even more slowly"" can be barely twice L2 (220V home charging) speed.

This adds time. Everything adds time. Time is the enemy. \[Shakes sleepy, road-weary fist\]

From there our next stop was the EVGo in North Haven, CT. Here thankfully there was no queue. But there *was* a person next to us panicking because their car hit 0% as they arrived and, they didn't know how to use the backup key in their fob to get the dog out.

I did my best to help, but just then the dog managed to lower the power windows. Good dog!

Please take the impact of cold weather on your range seriously, people.

Charging was still fairly slow, but we only needed enough to reach our hotel in Manchester. We renegotiated to see my mom the next day, so we could go direct to our hotel, and drove on.

**Expectation Five: never fast charge to 100%... unless you have a good reason**

Here is where I can take a little credit for doing something intelligent:

I booked our stay at the Manchester Courtyard Marriott. Which is a five-minute walk from the Electrify America at Wal-Mart. And yes, there's a backup a few blocks away.

Now look, I know it's antisocial to charge to 100% at a fast charger if you don't need it. But with 18 degree weather coming on Sunday and plans to pick up mom in entirely the wrong direction, then zoom off into the charger-less wilds on Eastern Connecticut for Cousin-mas... we did need it. And since queues are rare after 9pm, we really weren't inconveniencing anybody.

So my wife and I dropped off my son at the hotel, drove across to the Wal-Mart, plugged in the car, made sure the app was feeding data, noted the lack of a queue due to the late hour... and walked back to the hotel. Where we had dinner and relaxed in the lobby until the car was approaching 100%. Then I walked back and unplugged it and parked at the hotel.

**Expectation Six: Waze is best... except when it isn't**

Man, Sunday was cold! We didn't leave the hotel until it hit a balmy 18 degrees Fahrenheit outside. Hey, that's warm on Mars.

But even with a 100% charge to start, we still had to top off again in Manchester after picking up mom just to have a decent safety margin, knowing it would only get colder on the way back. Hey, you'd be cautious too with someone over 80 in the car.

And even then I was concerned, until while playing around in Google Maps it offered me a ""greener route"" that was 15 miles shorter (!). Yes it added a little time but I definitely did not give a shit at this point. And route 6 was a wonderful scenic drive. So many hobby farms.

We are a Waze family. Waze is to be trusted at all costs. Except for our sacred vow to always take the Tappan Zee (aka Mario Cuomo) Bridge and never, ever take our chances on NYC traffic.

But on this day I was very grateful for the setting that allows Google Maps to offer low-energy routes for EVs.

The family party was wonderful, but it was still a long night. I didn't want to squeak in with less than 20 miles of range, so we stopped in Manchester yet again before dropping mom off in Simsbury.

And you can bet I ended the night by plugging in for a long winter's charge, walking to the hotel, and returning to the card in the bracing cold on my own over 90 minutes later. I did this on my own this time, to zero objections.

Generally this Electrify America charger worked great, but it did unexpectedly halt my charge at 93%... and threaten to start late fees in 1 minute! This had the intended effect of causing me to bolt out of bed and race down the street. When I got there I discovered the actual grace period is 10 minutes. LOL. I see what you did there EA.

**Expectation Seven: the Bolt EUV is great... except when it isn't**

Our drive home on Monday took nine and a half hours. This is a new record, and not in the right direction. So this part is a little harder for me to write.

Holiday traffic was a factor of course, and so were bio breaks. Lost time equals more bio breaks equals more last time. Also we didn't sprint to the car first thing in the AM to avoid traffic, because (1) see above under ""cold,"" and (2) we'd promised to spend a little more time with my mother. Which I very much *wanted* to do.

But I can't ignore the hour and a half we spent simply queueing on Monday. Or the greatly increased time per charge. Or the need to charge multiple times per day, rather than just once at the halfway point.

I CAN ignore the time we spent just winding our way into the Westfield Garden State Plaza Mall, and the high-intensity queueing process that followed, because I am a f\*\*\*ing moron for suggesting that we charge there two nights before Christmas!

So OK... that's half an hour of our lives we could have had back without my stupidity. But even without that... still a nine-hour journey.

Also that mall did allow us to sit in a warm comfortable place and eat our poke bowls until we reached 87%. Which saved an entire stop... which may have gained us time overall anyway!

And even before the Mall Incident (tm), my wife and I had already discussed the elephant in the room: the Bolt EUV is just not the right choice for holiday driving. Especially in cold weather.

So next time, we will rent an ICE car for the holidays.

I admit it, I feel bad about this. But I really shouldn't! Owning a cheap EV is much like other environmentally sound choices, such as going without a car entirely: **if you don't allow yourself to occasionally chuck the rules and rent a regular car, you will eventually chuck the baby out with the bathwater and buy a hybrid. So let yourself do that.**

Frustration is the ultimate enemy here... time is just his lieutenant. We have to pace ourselves.

Besides, it wouldn't be the first time. We rented a car to drive to Vermont for the eclipse. And the year before that our car was in the shop and we wound up driving a rental for Thanksgiving, which allowed us to catch a concert in DC the night before and still make it.

Plus... there's an Enterprise Rental Car in walking distance of our house. It's meant to be.

So I put a recurring annual appointment in our Google Calendar to confirm our holiday travel dates and book a car. And the rest of the time, we'll enjoy our EV, which is usually perfect for anything within 100 miles, and pretty damn good even further out when only one fast charge is required.

Obviously: your mileage may, literally, vary. Maybe your only role in holiday travel is getting there and you don't shuttle family members around. Maybe your car charges faster to begin with and has more range to lose when it gets cold.

If you really want to go all EV all the way, even for road trips, make sure you buy a vehicle that offers much faster charging and significantly higher range. Or hey, just rent once in awhile.

(Note that I edited this post to be more specific to the Bolt since our experience would have been a great deal different in certain EVs.)",12-27-2024
"Do any cars do anything with braking energy when the battery is too cold for regen?As many folks know batteries can't be charged if they are cold without lithium plating - plugging a cold battery into a charger results in the charger warming it up, then charging it. In cold weather most people use charge/conditioning schedules to preheat their batteries before leaving using grid power, so the battery is nice and warm while they drive.

But this isn't always possible -- sometimes you have to drive with a cold-soaked battery (or use battery energy to warm it up). And this means no regen -- you can't charge a -15C battery. Teslas have a ""limited regen"" warning and will apply the friction brakes rather than regen when you release the accelerator (to maintain consistent driving dynamics since the car should behave the same regardless of battery temperature for safety). I imagine other cars do something similar.

The lack of regen results in markedly worse efficiency in city driving and driving anywhere hilly. This doesn't affect long-trip range, but does result in more energy use than ideal in town.

However, you can still use regenerative braking with a frozen battery -- you just can't put the energy *in the battery*. This leads me to wonder if anyone has implemented a PTC (resistive) heater that is capable of using a few tens of kW from the drive motors during regen for a few seconds at a time; if your battery is too cold for regen, then you'll likely either appreciate this heat in the cabin or it can be used to heat the pack (helping you get warm enough for regen more quickly).

A bit of quick math: braking from 45mph to zero gives you about 0.1 kWh of energy, which is also enough to warm a battery by about 1C. This isn't nothing, and is better than just burning it up in the brakes.

Do any cars make use of regen energy to run a heater when the battery is too cold to accept it? If not, is there any obstacle to doing this?",12-27-2024

"My Recent Experience with TeslaI am writing this post to share my experience and interactions with Tesla. The intention is not to trash Tesla, it is just to share the facts so that others can learn from my experiences.

It all started in June, 2024.  I needed to buy a new car so I could give my old Honda Accord to my 16 year old son as his first car. It's worth noting that my Honda Accord will likely be the single best car I will ever have. It's a 2006 and it has lasted 18 years without ANY major repairs (just tires, brakes, oil changes).

For several years I had long wanted a Tesla model 3. I love the technology they put in their cars. Tesla is truly pushing the industry into EV / ADAS.  That said, I purchased a Model 3 performance vehicle in mid June from the Tigard, Oregon location.

The car was performing great until around late July / early August (I don't recall exactly when). Each time I drove the car an alert appeared indicating the following:  ""Adaptive ride control degraded"" ""Ride Comfort may be reduced"". Since the alert kept coming up, I ""clicked on it"" in the car and the instructions said the issue was temporary and it will go away with time.  Well, it never went away.

On September 3rd I took the car in for its first appointment. The car was in service for 15 days. The techs replaced a wiring harness and then they gave me the car back on September 18th. The night I received the car back, within a mile of leaving the service center, the alert came back. So, I promptly checked the car back in on September 20th.

The car was then in service through September 25th.  The techs did some work on the car and then I received the car back.  I drove the car some more and the next day the code came back while I was on my way to lunch.  So, on September 26th I checked the car back in.

The car was then in service from September 26th through October 15th. I received the car back after Tesla replaced a bunch of stuff and everything worked great until October 30th when the alert came back.  I returned the car on October 31st and the Tesla service manager agreed to buy the car back as it was now legally classified as a Lemon by Oregon law.

During the month of November I was in the process of buying a replacement Model 3 (same car, same color etc). Despite the fact that I was in the middle of the buy-back process, Tesla raised the price of my car by $1,000 and they were unwilling to work with me on the price.  That said, I was able to take advantage of a special incentive and ""referred"" my wife to buy the car so we would save the $1000 and we received a $1000 of Tesla Shop money.  I took delivery of the new Tesla on December 1st.  During that same week we used the Tesla Shop money to upgrade the car.

A couple weeks after upgrading the car I received a request for a W9 from Tesla because I redeemed more than $600 of Tesla shop money in one year and they needed to issue me a 1099 for the ""income"" I received.

When we took delivery of the car, Tesla was having technical issues and they asked us to sign hard copy documents to buy the car.  About a week later we received an email saying that the hard copies would cause delays in working with the bank. We ignored that email.  Within a business day or so, the same person at Tesla started to threaten to reposes the vehicle if we did not digitally sign the documents.  We agreed to the digital signatures only if we were guaranteed we were not generating an additional loan.

The buy-back process of the original Model 3 has been slow and drawn out. As of today, I am 57 days into the process and Tesla has still not purchased the car back.  Apparently they are having issues pulling together paperwork.  I have escalated the issue as best as I can. It does not appear as though anyone at Tesla can really help me get this resolved.  I am now insuring a car that sits unused in a Tesla parking lot and I am about to start making payments on the new Tesla I purchased at the beginning of December. When I explain the issue to folks at Tesla they appear to understand my issue but no one appears to be able to help. It appears as though I am on my own until someone at Tesla figures out how to process the paperwork.

Hopefully everything will work out in the end.  And I do hope that folks can read this story and share their own experiences (positive or negative).

A new brand challenges Tesla: Onvo L60 REVIEW - a better Model Y?,12-25-2024
"How I got a brand new Tesla Model Y AWD for freetldr: Colorado tax credits + good financing + questionable investing

I was recently in the market for a new car, and very quickly realized that the EV discounts in Colorado are so good I couldn‚Äôt justify buying an ICE. I got about $28k in discounts, and with some careful financing/investing tricks I will make another $30k+ after taxes so I actually net a profit on the purchase. Although not all the rebates are still live, you can still get most of them! The rebates are very state dependent, and while Colorado is clearly the best state for it, some other states offer extra rebates as well. I want to share what I did because it‚Äôs too good to keep to myself, and can hopefully help other people in Colorado or other EV friendly states make the switch.



**Car choice:** 

My base requirements were AWD and 300+ miles of range at a reasonable price. The standard bearer was the Model Y LR AWD, and nothing else could really compete with it. I hated the Mach E and it also only qualified for the federal rebate if you lease it. The Equinox EV was close but just a little too boring for me (if I didn‚Äôt need AWD, the 2025 FWD LT gets extra state rebates so would have been the obvious choice at <$9k pretax).



**Tax credits and requirements:**

* $7.5k Federal tax credit
* $5.35k Colorado state tax credit
* $5.5k Xcel rebate
* $6k Colorado Vehicle Exchange Program (VXC)

The Xcel and VXC programs are only for ‚Äúlow-income‚Äù applicants. While ‚Äúlow-income‚Äù would seemingly be some kind of poverty threshold, it‚Äôs actually a surprisingly low (well, high, technically) bar. You just need a 2023 AGI that is <80% of your county‚Äôs median income. In several Denver metro counties this is \~$80k for a single tax filer, and increases by \~$10k for each additional family member. These numbers will presumably be even higher for the next tax year. For the federal rebate you also need an AGI <$150k for a single filer.

The first 3 credits are relatively easy to get. Obviously most people don‚Äôt live in Colorado, but if you do you probably live in the Denver metro so Xcel is almost definitely your utility provider. You therefore just need to meet the income threshold above to get their rebate. However, as of mid-November, Xcel is out of funding for this program, and it‚Äôs not clear when they will reopen it.

The VXC credit was the hardest to get for me. The program offers any low-income resident $6k to trade in an old or high-emission ICE vehicle that is titled in *only your name*. There is no ownership length requirement, so I simply bought a car just to trade in for this rebate (I agree this is silly and not the spirit of the law, but it‚Äôs perfectly legal). There are lots of cheap old beaters for sale, but the cheapest ones don‚Äôt pass emissions, which sounds good (we should get those off the road!), but to retitle in my name I needed a passing emissions test. Luckily, after a few weeks of diligent craigslisting I found a 1993 truck (older than me!) for $500 that somehow passed emissions. Registration and 1 month of insurance cost another \~$100.

The only credit I did not get was the bonus $2.5k Colorado EV credit for a vehicle with MSRP <$35k. AFAIK only the Leaf S and FWD Equinox LT qualify, so I‚Äôm not that mad about it.



**The math:**

* $48k: base 2024 Model Y LR AWD
* $0.6k: VXC vehicle + insurance/fees
* \-$7.5k: federal tax credit
* \-$5.35k: state tax credit
* \-$5.5k: Xcel rebate
* \-$6k: VXC credit
* \-$0.5k: Tesla referral discount
* \-$3.85k: Tesla Q3 inventory discount 

net: $19.8k + $5.5k (tax/fees) = \~$25k final cost

$25k is famously not $0, but it is the amount that I will eventually pay Tesla. However, by financing the car and taking some of the rebates myself, I basically took out a loan against the car, and was able to invest it to cover this cost too. (Alternatively, I financed the car with a negative downpayment)



**Financing steps:**

* Tesla/Wells Fargo financed me at 5y/0% (another Q3 promo offer). This is literally just a free loan, so I actually want to finance as much as possible at this rate. The required minimum downpayment of 20% + tax/fees \~$13k. This would leave me with an outstanding balance of $36k.
* This is *more than I should owe*, so taking all the credits at point-of-sale would lower my loan obligation, which I didn‚Äôt want. Therefore, it became a game of seeing which credits I could take after the fact.
* I made my downpayment using the VXC credit and state tax credit and paying the remaining $1.5k out of pocket. The VXC credit must be applied at point of sale. The state tax credit is refundable, so it is counterintuitive to take point of sale, but if you take it at tax time instead you lose the $350 bonus.
* I did the Xcel paperwork myself and received $5.5k by check (They claim there‚Äôs a chance this amount is now taxable on the website. It isn‚Äôt.)
* I will be filing for the federal tax credit myself as well. My 2024 AGI is >$72k (luckily, this is *below* the ‚Äúlow-income‚Äù threshold) so I have enough tax burden that I can actually claim the full credit (this is essential, because unlike the state credit this one is not refundable).

Once my IRS check clears, I will have an outstanding loan for $36k, but also $11k more in my bank account than I started with (including the VXC acquisition cost).

This might be cheating, but I had a little more room to work with. Carvana gave me $12k for my 10yo corolla (that was originally $16k brand new!). Adding this on top I essentially had $23k in cash on hand in exchange for financing a new Tesla.



**Investing:** 

Now I magically have extra cash and extra time to pay it back, so I better put that money to work.

* The safe thing to do would be to park the cash in a MMF and get an easy 4-5% to offset as much of the loan payments as possible. This saves you around $5k over the loan term.
* The smart thing to do would be to park the cash in SPX and get \~9% returns in expectation. This works out to around $10k in extra savings if the market behaves, making the net cost \~$15k.
* The not-so-smart thing to do would be to put it all in $TSLA shares and hope they continue to beat the market for 5 years. 

Luckily, I am not safe or smart or even not-so-smart. I simply spent $23k on $TSLA LEAPS. If they 2.5x in a few years I would net $0 (even offsetting the bonus cash from the trade in). This did not happen! Instead I‚Äôm up almost 3x in about 2 months! (remember I bought in late October. I did not expect the election outcome or subsequent rally at all. I promise this was all stupidity and luck). I am continuing to HODL for the short term since I can‚Äôt sell too much this year if I want to remain under the federal tax credit threshold, but I might sell a little soon just to take profits. I'm not sure if it‚Äôs worth hanging on for next year to avoid long term gains, but I think I still got a great deal either way, since I will at the very least panic sell before it drops below the breakeven price.

And that‚Äôs how I got my car for free :)",12-25-2024
"Tax Return Scam Mail ""IRS Notice CP99B""Hey everyone, I had a question about recent mail I received from the ""IRS"".

I purchased an Tesla directly from a local Tesla dealer earlier this year and qualified/used the federal tax credit. Last week, I got mail from the ""Department of Treasury IRS"" claiming my vehicle was returned and the tax credit was ""returned"". I'm not sure if this is a scam or not, as they listed my vin correctly, and seems like some information is accurate. But other items I can't find online, such as the ""IRS Notice CP99B"" or a website they list as ""irs.gov/cleanenergy""

Anyone heard of something like this?



\*UPDATE\* - Others who ran into this and contacted the IRS who instructed them to contact their Tesla dealer. I followed suit and contacted my local dealer where I bought the vehicle earlier this year. The way it was explained to me by the manager at Tesla is that Tesla must have made a mistake while processing paperwork to/with the IRS. In order to correct this, Tesla had to ""return"" the vehicle on their end, which is when the IRS sent the notices out. Tesla, having received the notice from my end, will contact the IRS on their end to acknowledge the mistake and correct it. ",12-23-2024

"How can I charge 2 EVs efficiently without tripping  circuit? Our future setup is 14-50 NEMA outlet and a Tesla Wall Connector, I assume if both use separate circuits (1 50 amp circuit for 14-50 and 1 60 amp circuit for tesla dedicated charger) then no more tripping?To start off, I am no electrician and I am asking on behalf of my father as he knows everything about how he got these set up, but to my knowledge we are currently using 2 14-50 NEMA outlets (I assume each connects to a separate 50 amp circuit, although if I charge both cars at the same time they trip so I assume both are using same circuit maybe?), one for the mobile tesla charger for 32 Amps and one for the ford mach E also the mobile charger (pretty trash and slow compared to the tesla mobile charger) and our electric plan is made so that we get the lowest rates when we use electricity from 12AM to 6 AM so obviously this is when we charge the cars.

Currently what am doing is I charge them separate, by setting a manual charging schedule on the tesla and the ford car apps, so maybe I would do 12AM-4AM tesla and 4AM-6AM ford but when I try to charge both at the same time I get a trip. Again I assume this trip happens because likely both outlets are using the same 50 amp circuit, when you should be using 2 separate circuits? Is that even possible to have both outlets hooked up to same circuit or am I an idiot lol (again have no clue what am talking about here)

So I am wondering, since we are planning to go for a dedicated tesla wall charger which supposedly can do 48 AMPs, but also plan to keep using the 14-50 outlet which should be able to get us 40 AMPS if I go for a decent third party EVSE, is their a way to charge both at the same time? Kind of like a chargepoint station where it would flip from 32 AMPs to 16 if two cars connect to it? Although we are not using the same charger to charge both cars, I assume I can just manually adjust the tesla wall charger to maybe 20 AMPs and at the same time adjust the third party EVSE thats on the 14-50 outlet to also be like 20 AMPS or even 16 and that way I can charge both? Would that work do you think?

I am not sure what value is the maximum before our circuit trips, I assume if we are using 2 separate circuits then this won't be an issue and I can easily charge one car at 48A and the other at 40A without any tripping if both use separate circuits right? And again lets assume we are currently using the same circuit for both chargers, assuming that circuit is 50 AMP, therefore using that 80% calculation we get 40 AMP maximum therefore, each car should pull 20A and that way it won't trip correct?",12-23-2024

"The relatively unknown risk of transferring your EV tax creditI want to post a warning to folks regarding transferring their EV tax credit at the time of purchase of an EV. This sounds like a great benefit, but it can cost you later.  

For me, it started in June of this year.  I purchased a Tesla Model 3 performance vehicle.  Unfortunately, by September the car was having issues.  By the end of October, Tesla agreed to buy the car back. Here is where things went sideways for me. Tesla was willing to give me back all the money I put in the vehicle (less depreciation of course) but they are not willing to refund the tax credit I transferred.  They are pocketing that one.  Had I not transferred the credit in June, I would have been able to file for the credit with my 2024 tax return and keep the full $7.5K.

I am kicking myself on this one because I had another option. Knowing I had a $7.5K credit, I could have simply adjusted my withholdings from my employer throughout 2024 to account for the credit. Then, I would not have had any issues with Tesla capturing the credit.  

Please pass this onto anyone else considering an EV purchase. Buy-backs are rare but they do happen.  ",12-22-2024
"Why Aren't EVs More Popular In Affluent Suburbia?I currently reside in Cambridge MA (a city with a high share of EVs relative to the state as a whole despite the fact 65% rent and many people don't have access to home charging) and currently own a Tesla Model 3. I utilise both the municipal chargers (about half a mile away from home) and the superchargers whenever I need electricity, and I have seen at least 5 EVs mainly street parked with the street parking sticker just in my block alone. I have seen numerous EVs in Cambridge on a daily basis, including at least a dozen Teslas each day, several Rivian's, and even one Lucid daily, and many many more legacy EVs. In fact, there is even a Mach E in the Cambridge police fleet.

However, I have relatives in a Worcester suburb (Holden) and even though that town is affluent relative to the state average (median household income is 150k and 60% have a bachelor's degree or higher), you would think that many have EVs due to the fact almost every house (I reckon 98%) has a garage. But out of 100 cars, I have only seen like 1-2 EVs, and they are mostly Tesla Model 3, Model Y or Ford Mustang Mach E. I have seen a greater share of EVs in Worcester despite being less affluent. In Shrewsbury, a similar town, there are far more EVs on the road.

From what I have seen, the most popular cars in Holden are cars like the Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV, Subaru Forester, Toyota Highlander, and Toyota Camry. I have not seen many hybrids either and pickup trucks are kinda rare. I am so intrigued about why EVs just aren't more popular despite the fact Holden kinda fits the clientele for new or used EVs. At the Big Y supermarket Plaza parking lot, I have seen no EVs of any kind (I visited Holden Big Y 3 times, in 2022, 2023, and 2024), even if there are at least 100 cars in the parking lot. In 2024, I was the only EV parked at the Big Y.

Based on my takes:

At least half of residents qualify for the $7500 tax credit, and Massachusetts has a $3500 tax credits on top of the $7500, meaning EVs might become more affordable than their ICE counterparts after factoring towards long term costs

A substantial minority qualify for the $4000 tax credit for used EVs under 25k

Holden is relatively affluent, with a median household income of 150k

Almost all homes have a garage and 90% own a house, and home charging in many cases is significantly cheaper than gas

Most people in Holden buy commuter cars to go from Point A to Point B, and Worcester is 10 mi away, Framingham is 30 mi away, and Boston is 50 mi away

Holden's share of EVs relative to all cars is lower than Massachusetts as a whole, despite a median household income that is 50% higher, and far lower than Boston/Cambridge.

Edit: EVs are everywhere in Cambridge, Brookline, Somerville, Newton, Lexington, Belmont, Arlington, Weston, Wellesley, Natick, Westborough, Shrewsbury, and even Quincy. However, they are quite rare in Holden despite the fact Holden is considered upper middle class.

"Labeled charging spots and flat charging curvesI believe one of the EV markets biggest issues is the complexity on the user end. 
 I thought of 2 ""solutions"".  If I'm missing something, please suggest why this isn't good.  If you agree, feel free to share this opinion around the community (don't need to share the post, just the opinion)

1) Charging stations should have the parking spot painted for what each spot is for. (i.e. paint says ""NACS"", ""CCS"", or maybe even ""NACS/CCS"" for Tesla magic dock spots).
Then also say max charge rate (""250kW"" or ""350kW"", etc.)
This way, as an owner, all you need to know is what plug your car has and what charge rate you can handle (and the fact that you can plug into higher or lower, but getting close is the goal).
Once the plug war(NACS vs CCS) is over, only the rate will be needed.


2) I suspect flat charging curves are going to be the future.  The flatter the curve, the simpler the planning will be.  Road tripping my EV is stressful cause of the ""arrive at low SoC"" thing.  The flat curves of the F150 lightning looks SO nice and simple for a road trip.  Just charge to 80% and then stop at the next place you want to stop at. ",12-20-2024

"EV long distance road trips in EuropeOur first EVs were a Nissan e-NV200 van, and a Nissan Leaf (30kWh), but my first really long trip in an EV was when we bought an ex-demo Mercedes eVito Tourer 90kWh van (8 seats) from a German Mercedes dealership, that I drove by myself 2,590 km (1,609 miles) back home to Portugal, in June of 2021.

[Almost brand new!](https://preview.redd.it/jvi5q7hy3t7e1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4145923cd10d7fda82780ed3bccc7a074d8fc6f4)

It took me two and a half days, with two night stops, the first near Paris, and the second in northern Spain. It was completely uneventful, mainly using the Ionity charging network. The most interesting occurrence was being stopped by the French highway police, due to the German export plates, and ending up having a nice chat (in my terrible French) with a bunch of officers who were curious about it being a fully electric van.

My second trip was a bit more intense, both in terms of the pace, and of the reason behind it. It involved driving a total of 6,952 km (4,320 miles) from Lisbon to Warsaw and back under 116 hours, in March 2022, to get two Ukrainian families to safety in Portugal, plus two dogs, two cats, a hamster, and the little luggage they managed to bring while fleeing. One of my best friends Nuno was my co-driver, and we only stopped to charge the van, both on the way out, and on the way back.

My third long EV trip was touring from Lisbon to Venice, Stuttgart, Barcelona, and Seville with my son Z√©, stopping every night along the way, and meeting friends. We drove 6,145 km (3,819 miles) in eight days, and I used the charging stops to work remotely. The main difference in comparison to the other two first trips was that the Tesla network had already been partially opened to all EVs, so it made the trip even easier and cheaper.

My fourth and fifth EV trips were in early 2024, when we bought two used Kia e-Niro 64kWh EVs in the Netherlands, and drove them back to Portugal, two weeks apart. The trip is around 2,300 km (1,429 miles). On the first one, I drove back in 35 hours straight with my friend Luis, and on the 2nd trip, 2 weeks later, I drove by myself in 2.5 days, and I had lunch with [u/electricfelixdotcom](https://www.threads.net/@electricfelixdotcom)! We have since decided to keep the Mercedes, and sold the first Kia instead.

My sixth and seventh long EV trips were in the summer of 2024, both roundtrips from Lisbon to M√°laga in Spain, to drop off and then pickup my son Z√© for a 2 week Summer camp. The roundtrip is around 1,400 km (869 miles), and we did the first one in one go (stopping in Sevilla to have lunch with friends on the way south), driving with my friend Bas√≠lio, and on second one I drove down by myself, sleeping in M√°laga before coming back. The van reached 100.000 km on the odometer on the second trip.

[Still on the original brake pads and rotors!](https://preview.redd.it/3gvya2ug6t7e1.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f934b33c8c9219054c625ebe2fd7eb07eecd2a)

We are currently in the middle our eight road trip. I drove from Lisbon to Barcelona with two of our kids (stopping near Zaragoza) to pick up the rest of the family who flew there (minus one who was not able to join us), and then to Andorra, for a week of skiing (everyone else, not me!), and we are driving back (dropping them back in Barcelona) this weekend. Around 90% of Tesla Superchargers in Spain are now open to non-Tesla EVs, so are mainly using the Tesla network on the road - with a one month subscription - and using the plentiful AC chargers here in Andorra.

[Lots of AC chargers at a reasonable ‚Ç¨0.32 per kWh](https://preview.redd.it/6snvusg47t7e1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1f4d7075ce876a070042963efb5d1c19cc8df1d)

"Do you know if there‚Äôs a registry of cool US charging facilities? (Ionna, Mercedes HQ, Joshua Tree RAN, etc)I‚Äôll be driving from Miami to Kennebunkport. I can make it most of the way using RAN chargers alone (with a couple Tesla/evgo/EA thrown in), but I‚Äôm hoping to intentionally stop at cool/interesting charging stops to break up the standard Walmart parking lot experience.  

I‚Äôm having a hard time finding a list of cool/interesting charging facilities worth checking out (obviously ABRP/route guidance and PlugShare are great, but bias toward shortest trip rather than ‚Äúcool‚Äù). 

Some examples are the ones listed in the title, ionnas new facilities, Joshua Tree RAN etc.  

So 2 questions, 

1) are you aware of a list?
2) if not, have any recommendations for east coast chargers worth checking out?

 Not necessarily concerned about travel time, just enjoying the drive and I find charging interesting.  Thanks!",12-18-2024

"Added a 2nd EV This Weekend!For the past few months, my husband (43M) & I (39F) have done a ton of EV research with the plan to buy or lease a second one in late spring. After the US election results, we decided to move that timeline up to‚Ä¶now. Financially, that actually wound up being a better decision because of end of year deals & incentives.

I currently drive a 2022 MINI Cooper SE. Her name is Winnie Cooper. She gets about 110 miles of range per charge. Our other car is, legally my grandmother-in-law‚Äôs, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee with quite a few miles on it. Cosmetically, it‚Äôs in GREAT shape. His grandparents took really good care of it. Mechanically, something needs fixed about every other month now & we decided it was time to get something new.

Neither of us have a commute & we live in the city, so Winnie‚Äôs been perfectly adequate for around town driving. We need a larger vehicle for several reasons - my husband‚Äôs family lives about 60 miles away & Winnie is not able to do the drive on a single charge. They‚Äôre in a more rural area and there is literally one charger near there. It‚Äôs a Level 2 and it‚Äôs at a casino. The charging is free but the gambling is not! We also have 2 giant dogs & neither fit in Winnie. So even just going to the vet, we need something to haul them in. Add in the occasional CostCo run and it‚Äôs just easier to have a larger car for those trips.

I set some parameters - budget (less than $1000/month including insurance), size (has to fit in the garage but also has to fit dogs), BEV (no plug-in hybrid, regular hybrid, ICE, etc), & range (over 200 miles). We compiled a list of contenders & on Saturday set out about 10a to go drive a whole bunch of cars. The convenient thing about our metro area - there‚Äôs a street that has basically every car dealer you can think of in a 3 mile stretch (except Ford, for whatever reason). I chose not to test drive anything. This is technically my husband‚Äôs car, so I wanted to let him decide without too much of my influence. The comments about acceleration/handling/etc are his.

Our List:

* Volvo XC40 - great acceleration, handles very well, really nice interior, rear heated seats, unique/fun dashboard design
* Volvo C40 - didn‚Äôt drive because it‚Äôs identical to the XC40 minus the sportback
* Audi Q4 e-tron - extremely nice interior, good size, handles well, navigation map has a ‚Äòrange‚Äô option, most buttons are touch sensitive which is nice, dislike the faux wood dashboard, passenger side headrest is weirdly curved and uncomfortable with a ponytail (I assume it‚Äôs the same headrest on the driver‚Äôs side but you don‚Äôt drive with the back of your head on the rest)
* Mercedes EQB - didn‚Äôt drive it, didn‚Äôt have ANY in stock, closest was over an hour away. I was super disappointed because this was my favorite going into Saturday. My husband didn‚Äôt really like the boxy design, so he wasn‚Äôt unhappy to skip it.
* Chevy Blazer - Pretty boring, interior was basic, customer service was lacking (they didn‚Äôt even bring a license plate when we asked to test drive it so we just did laps in the parking lot). A little too big IMO
* Chevy Equinox - hate it, didn‚Äôt drive it
* Cadillac Lyriq - husband‚Äôs favorite but the insurance was extremely high and put it out of budget
* Acura ZDX - didn‚Äôt drive it, uuuugly, looks way too much like a hearse¬†



Since the Ford dealership isn‚Äôt near the others, husband drove these the weekend before

* Ford F150 Lightning - HATE the size of the screen, way too big, drove very smooth though
* Ford Mustang Mach-e - same screen - made it an immediate no



We are not fans of Tesla and didn‚Äôt like any of the Nissans, Hyundais, or Kias. Rivian, Genesis, & Polestar were out of our budget. I really wish Buick would do an EV. I love the look of the Envista & the Encore.

After driving different cars for almost 3 hours, we stopped at a local pizza place to have lunch, watch Purdue basketball lose, & discuss our options. I was \*shocked\* my husband‚Äôs favorite was the Audi. That was my favorite too. I thought the Mach-E was going to be his winner. We both agreed the Volvos were a very close second & if the numbers didn‚Äôt work out, we‚Äôd go with a Volvo.

We wound up leasing a 2024 Audi Q4 55 e-tron quattro. Husband really wanted blue but there were only 2 within 250 miles. One had a white interior (hard no) and the other was the base model. We also considered the sportback but the available inventory didn‚Äôt have the options or color (not gray) we wanted.

MSRP was $64,655. We wanted a 3 year lease with 10,000 miles/year & $0 down. The first number the salesman brought back was $886/month. Which was insanely high. And we told him that. He ‚Äúwent to talk to the sales manager‚Äù and suddenly it was $740/month. Sold. We‚Äôd done insurance quotes on them prior to driving & the Audi was in the $130/month range. Added the Audi Care during the signing process and now we‚Äôre final at $753/month.

After debating German names, we landed on Viktor. My husband is a huge Minnesota Vikings fan, so with the white exterior and interior lights set to purple, he‚Äôs very spirited. Viktor‚Äôs a beaut and we‚Äôre super excited to drive him for 3 years.

"I‚Äôm a former Tesla engineer who helped build the Roadster battery & now CEO of Sila. We launched the first next-gen battery material, boosting lithium-ion performance for longer range, faster charging EVs & breakthrough consumer devices. AMA about battery innovation and powering AI-enabled devices! Hi¬†[r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/)! I‚Äôm Gene Berdichevsky, Co-Founder and CEO of¬†[Sila](https://www.silanano.com/), a next-gen battery materials company. My journey in battery innovation began as the 7th employee at Tesla, helping lead the development of the Roadster battery, the world‚Äôs first safe, mass-produced lithium-ion battery system for EVs.

At Tesla, I realized that conventional lithium-ion batteries had reached their energy limits, due to the use of graphite anodes. The lack of progress in lithium-ion battery performance is a major barrier to improvements in EV range, charge time, and cost‚Äîcritical factors for mass adoption. I knew there had to be a better solution, and at Sila we engineered one. Using silicon as an anode material has been the holy grail within battery innovation circles because of its ability to store 10x more charge than graphite. However, the powerful properties of silicon were hard to tame for safe, commercial use in batteries. After more than a decade of research, we cracked the code.¬†

We introduced the first next-gen battery material to the market. Our anode,¬†[Titan Silicon](https://www.silanano.com/our-solutions/titan-silicon-anode), boosts energy density by 20-40% to enable smaller, more powerful batteries. Our tech debuted in the Whoop 4.0 fitness tracker and is now powering multiple devices. We recently launched a¬†[Battery Engineering Service](https://www.silanano.com/our-solutions/battery-engineering-services)¬†to help device manufacturers bring ambitious product innovations to the market, powered by next-gen battery performance.

Designing batteries for cars‚Äîa ‚Äúcomputer on four wheels‚Äù‚Äîtaught me how to create batteries that can power major platform shifts. Now, I‚Äôm applying these principles at Sila to address the growing demands of consumer electronics, a fast-evolving market driven by AI and AR. As brands race to market, battery design has become a critical focus in product development. If battery life falls short, consumers will switch brands, making battery performance a top priority.

Ask me anything about silicon anode technology, designing batteries for new products, or how we‚Äôre working to ensure that battery life is not left behind in the wave of power-hungry devices embedded with AI and AR.¬†**I‚Äôll be here until 10am PT to answer your questions!**

"Every Monday morning I invest $1,885. Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

Please provide any thoughts or constructive criticism below. Thank you",12-20-2024
"Can Tesla bounce back quicklyTesla stock has been on a recent surge, especially after Trump's victory, with shares soaring from $246.23 to $487, a gain of nearly 97%. This rise has been largely driven by politics, particularly Musk's relationship with Trump. But the question is, how long will this premium due to politics last?



Tesla's future is also closely tied to Fully Self-Driving (FSD). If FSD is successfully rolled out and receives regulatory approval, Tesla could transform into an online car company, which would be a steady source of cash flow. However, regulatory issues and technology rollout remain challenges.



Although Tesla's stock price has risen sharply, analysts have mixed views on its outlook. Barclays maintains a ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù rating, believing that Tesla's stock price is out of touch with the company's fundamentals, with a price target of $270. CFRA, on the other hand, is more optimistic about Tesla, raising its price target to $560, believing that the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit will help Tesla expand its market share.



Going forward, Tesla could be at risk of a stock price correction, but if FSD goes smoothly and there are no regulatory hurdles, Tesla's long-term outlook remains bullish.

"NVIDIA's Recent Decline and Opportunities for a New RallyNVIDIA fell nearly 4% today before narrowing the loss to 1.22%. Since hitting a record closing high of $148.88 in early November, the AI chip maker's stock has dropped over 10%.

So, what is causing NVIDIA's decline?

**1. Supply Chain Issues and Challenges**

NVIDIA faces multiple challenges in its supply chain, a significant factor in its stock decline.

First, according to the latest data, the order volume and schedules for the GB200 and GB300 have been adjusted. Particularly, the mass production and shipment of GB series products have been postponed until after the Lunar New Year in February, increasing market uncertainty. Additionally, the small-scale production plans for GB300 face tight deadlines, putting pressure on GB200's mass production.

https://preview.redd.it/scpz7bjoak7e1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c84a2bd55783d7b6efd0bfff35d9d3c4a3db74bb

Specific supply chain issues include CoWoS-L packaging technology, heating problems, copper cable connections, and leakage issues. These not only affect product yield rates but also increase system integration time costs. Consequently, NVIDIA has suggested customers purchase the B200 8-card HGX as a transitional solution, and clients like Microsoft are considering switching their orders. These supply chain issues affect NVIDIA's product delivery capabilities and reduce market expectations for its future performance.

**2. Market Competition and Narrative Changes**

ASICs are gaining market recognition as a competitive narrative.

ASICs are chips designed for specific tasks, akin to custom running shoes for a race. For certain tasks, ASICs outperform NVIDIA's GPUs (widely used for computing tasks) and are potentially cheaper.

OpenAI co-founder Ilya and industry leaders like Microsoft's CEO Satya have started discussing the importance of not only training AI models but also ensuring they can quickly and accurately make decisions in real applications. This shift in perspective gives ASICs an advantage in some scenarios, as they are designed for rapid, precise execution of tasks.

This raises questions about the cost of NVIDIA's GPUs. While powerful, they are expensive and require significant electricity and cooling. As ASICs perform better at lower costs for some tasks, there's consideration of replacing NVIDIA's GPUs with ASICs.

Additionally, changes in scaling law narratives and the strengthening of inference narratives pose threats to NVIDIA.

Scaling laws suggest that increasing AI model size (e.g., more neurons or layers) typically improves performance, but these gains are not infinite and require significant computational resources. This means NVIDIA must continually invest resources to improve product performance, potentially increasing costs.

https://preview.redd.it/pjjpyc10bk7e1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=20d52e676ae3473e567bb43fb383864886de72cb

Moreover, companies like BTC, Tesla, and Google are investing heavily in their own AI chips or solutions. This intensifies market competition and challenges NVIDIA's leadership.

**3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flows**

Market sentiment and capital flow significantly impact NVIDIA's stock price. As the year ends, retail investors, ETFs, and institutions adjust their portfolios. Fluctuations in tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google affect tech stocks like NVIDIA. Investors are more cautious, favoring stable, promising companies.

Given these conditions, NVIDIA faces pressure on its stock price due to supply chain issues and competition. Lowered expectations for NVIDIA's future performance lead to capital outflows and stock price declines.

  
**4. Future Outlook and Catalysts**

Despite current challenges, NVIDIA has opportunities for a turnaround.

First, NVIDIA needs to resolve supply chain issues, improve product yield, and delivery capabilities. Second, strengthening its presence in software and applications is crucial to addressing market competition. Additionally, NVIDIA should explore new computing narratives to expand its computing potential.

 **5. Technical Analysis and Price Divergence**

Previously, prices rose continuously, but volume and KDJ began to decline, showing divergence. Without capital support, upward momentum was insufficient, leading to a short-term adjustment and a break below the mid-term trend line, resulting in a mid-term adjustment.

https://preview.redd.it/ok73jyoabk7e1.png?width=4274&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdb19d0e917d566e957a8693d65590b1adecf12

When Might a New Rally Occur?

From a technical analysis perspective: After two prior mid-term adjustments, breaking the downward trend line may signal the start of a new rally. Thus, this new rally must first break the resistance line.

https://preview.redd.it/2kg8hm6dbk7e1.png?width=4276&format=png&auto=webp&s=5917df78a1bf3692f719dc35622f9ad823fab4ba

  
From a catalyst perspective: While January's CES and the earnings release in late February may not bring major surprises, March's GTC is worth anticipating. NVIDIA needs to showcase new technologies and products at this event to restore market confidence. If NVIDIA can introduce groundbreaking innovations, a stock rebound is possible. ",12-18-2024
"Hindenburg Omen Hey all!

Chinese EVs - while they won‚Äôt be allowed in USA but they have made their point, they are cheaper, equally good and in some cases better - Tesla has limited international growth potential now. Like I hear in India people are paying over 100% in tariffs to buy BYD from Singapore - they say it‚Äôs still good value for money

"QUBT is about to crash hardContext: Quantum computing is having its moment. It‚Äôs risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

QUBT is junk

Quantum Computing Inc. has many problems. Iceberg Research‚Äôs recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that QUBT has made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

QUBT lacks talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of QUBT‚Äôs employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), QUBT ranks incredibly poorly among it‚Äôs peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues QUBT comes out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. Maybe QUBT is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of QUBT‚Äôs ‚Äútalent‚Äù comes from the Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company‚Äôs Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company QPhoton with QUBT. Notably he is both a QUBT director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of $SAVA). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang ‚Äî Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven‚Äôs. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company‚Äôs chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English literature at Steven‚Äôs, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven‚Äôs. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven‚Äôs is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees as QUBT. QBTS has six fold. All have similar market cap. What‚Äôs driving value? We‚Äôve established that it‚Äôs not human capital. Iceberg‚Äôs research reveals it‚Äôs not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well? QUBT‚Äôs high valuation is driven by regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of QUBT is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ, ~30% for RGTI and ~47% for QBTS. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment in QUBT while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag that something is up with QUBT. In fact no Wall Street analysts track QUBT. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

QUBT‚Äôs 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it‚Äôs junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why QUBT has done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

QUBT is literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you‚Äôre a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It‚Äôs a regard trap. 

It‚Äôs like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co.

"RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

"Why Donald Trump‚Äôs Return Could Boost Demand for Robots ‚Äì A Long-Term Investment OpportunityHey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there‚Äôs more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump‚Äôs stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap‚Äîand robots could be the answer.

That‚Äôs where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let‚Äôs talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they‚Äôve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we‚Äôre talking about. RR‚Äôs service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they‚Äôre receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn‚Äôt just conceptual‚Äîit‚Äôs been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there‚Äôs Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we‚Äôre after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",11-06-2024
"Educate me about stock So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it). 

I finally have money to seed some trades, trying to keep an eye out for the next thing now. ",11-05-2024

"Tesla Soars to Best Day in 11 Years After a Blowout Quarter> Tesla Inc.‚Äôs shares surged the most in more than 11 years after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.

Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla‚Äôs best quarterly earnings in more than a year.

"Tesla shares jump 10% on profit beat as company benefits from environmental creditsTesla shares jumped 10% following a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, driven by strong profit margins from environmental credits. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 72 cents, surpassing analysts‚Äô forecasts of 58 cents, though revenue slightly missed expectations at $25.18 billion. Automotive revenue rose 2%, while energy generation and storage revenue surged 52%, showcasing Tesla‚Äôs growing diversification.

A significant contributor to Tesla's profitability came from $739 million in regulatory credits, which the company earns for producing only electric vehicles. These credits, essentially pure profit, helped bolster Tesla‚Äôs bottom line. Additionally, Tesla hit a milestone with 7 million vehicles produced and reported that its Cybertruck achieved a positive gross margin for the first time, despite quality challenges.

Looking ahead, Tesla expects modest growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024, even as it faces increasing competition, particularly from Chinese automakers and U.S. legacy brands ramping up their electric vehicle efforts. Some investors are also raising concerns over CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs political activities, questioning how it could influence Tesla's brand and stock performance amidst a highly competitive landscape. Despite these challenges, Tesla remains committed to launching more affordable models by 2025.

"Thoughts on GOOGLanalysis# Why I'm ALL-IN on GOOGLE.

**Potential Antitrust Breakup (I love this!)**

I anticipate an antitrust breakup could unlock even greater value for Google. If this happens, owning the company before the breakup means we would receive shares of each separated business unit, which will most def drive a higher valuation.

**Waymo, Waymo Waymo**

Google‚Äôs self-driving division, Waymo, is making significant strides. They recently announced they will be committing $5 billion to the unit over a multi-year period.

**A**. Waymo is already operating in San Francisco, Phoenix, and soon to be Los Angeles, it's safe to say they cracked autonomous driving.

**B**. Critics argue that Tesla can scale better and that Waymo's cars are too expensive. To that, I disagree. Even if each Waymo vehicle costs $100k, plus another $100k for ALL associated expenses (fleet distribution, compute power, maintenance, talent, etc.), that still buys you 5,000 vehicles (assuming a 1-billion allocation of their stated investment), if each vehicle completes 15 rides per day, that‚Äôs over 26 million rides annually.

**C**. These rides not only generate revenue but also valuable data for future improvements.

**D**. This creates a significant competitive moat for Google, reinforcing its long-term dominance. The recognised moat is when the stock soars!

**Isomorphic Labs and AlphaFold-3**

Google's business unit Isomorphic Labs, and AlphaFold, are making rapid breakthroughs in drug discovery and forming partnerships across the pharmaceutical industry. With a potential antitrust breakup, this unit could thrive as a standalone company and attract substantial public investment, positioning itself as a legitimate pharmaceutical/AI powerhouse.

**Overall AI Expertise**

While Google‚Äôs search business is under threat, it‚Äôs important to recognize their AI prowess. Google is integrating AI across all their platforms, I think they'll retain a significant share of the search market over the long term. Their AI capabilities are vastly underappreciated.

**Android**

Android is an enormous business that could benefit from a spinoff. As a standalone company, Android could unlock significant value.

Hey! I'm really new to stock market and trading in general. I""m mainly a programmer and only a bystander in trading.

In 2020, I realized (even with all the controversy they had) Nvidia was doing *really* good, they also had their investments in a lot of technologies finally start to pay off and even if you exclude the c rypt0 frenzy it was somewhat clear that Nvidia was nourishing. At least to me as a programmer, I thought they had a ton of technological dominance and advancements in various areas. And especially in 2022 when AI stuff popped up, if it wasn't clear before that with all the research and investments they were doing in AI/ML space, like it should be clear by that point with image generation, LLMs and OpenAI popping off and all of them relying on Nvidia. But the stock price was still at 15 USD at maximum in 2022. At that time I had literally 0 knowledge in the stock market and thought ""Maybe this is Nvidia's value and this value includes all the new things and market is aware of Nvidia."" but in hindsight Nvidia was overly undervalued and the market was simply not aware of it. Maybe it was clear to me because Nvidia is in my domain but am I missing something?

For example, I also get the same vibes with Tesla. Yes it is crazily valued at the moment but still with the event they held yesterday and overall their direction, even if everyone hates Elon Musk, it also seems clear to me that Tesla will pack a lot more than what it currently is. The robotaxis, tesla robot, their battery techs, their knowledge in vision and ML and a lot more things will start to pay off eventually. After the event, I expected today to see a growth in Tesla but it was down by %3? Is everyone waiting a lower point of entry? Or are people just not impressed by the event and the promises?

"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter
Tesla‚Äôs stock slipped 3.5% in premarket trading after the company reported third-quarter delivery figures. The EV giant posted 462,890 deliveries and 469,796 vehicles produced, slightly below analyst expectations of 463,310 deliveries. While these numbers showed a year-over-year increase, Tesla‚Äôs growth rate appears to be slowing amidst intensifying competition, particularly in China from companies like BYD and Li Auto.

In the U.S., Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market, but competition is heating up. Rivian and legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors are making strides in the EV space. GM reported a 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter, but with just 32,100 units sold, Tesla‚Äôs lead remains substantial.

Tesla‚Äôs 2024 outlook remains uncertain, as executives have signaled a slower delivery growth rate compared to last year. Despite adding the highly anticipated Cybertruck to their lineup, the company faces challenges in maintaining momentum, particularly as investors focus on profit margins and the potential for further competition in the autonomous vehicle space.

Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs stock surged 32% in the third quarter, erasing its losses for the year. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company‚Äôs upcoming earnings report and marketing event, where Tesla is expected to reveal its latest advancements, including a potential robotaxi design.

"Uber and Waymo to offer driverless ride-hailing trips in Austin and AtlantaUber is taking its partnership with Alphabet's Waymo to new heights, announcing plans to offer autonomous ride-hailing services in Austin and Atlanta starting in early 2025. This move comes after the duo's initial success with robotaxi services in Phoenix, and now Uber riders in these two cities will have the chance to hop into a driverless Waymo vehicle for certain trips‚Äîexclusively through the Uber app.

The expansion marks a significant step for Uber in the robotaxi game, following the company's sale of its self-driving division back in 2020. Since then, Uber has been leaning on partnerships with companies like Waymo, GM's Cruise, and U.K.-based Wayve to re-enter the autonomous vehicle space.

Uber shares popped 5% on the news, while Alphabet saw a 1% rise. Investors have been nudging Uber to ramp up its autonomous vehicle strategy, especially ahead of Tesla‚Äôs upcoming robotaxi event in October. Uber's shares are down 17% from their 52-week high, partly in response to the increased competition.

Waymo, which has been steadily gaining traction, reported doubling its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 in San Francisco. Waymo‚Äôs co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, expressed excitement about expanding to Austin and Atlanta, adding that they are exploring future Uber Eats integrations in these cities.

The competition in the self-driving space is heating up, and Uber's latest move aims to solidify its position alongside major players like Waymo and Cruise.

"Opportunity In OracleI‚Äôve been hearing how oracle expects 9% revenue growth for FY 25 they also said for Q3 and Q4 24 they had signed their largest contracts to date. 

I‚Äôve also heard examples of how‚Äôd they‚Äôd apply their tech. One example tied to the medical industry. Say a doctor wanted to pull up past CT scans, MRIs, or other tests when meeting with a patient they can voice request these from Oracles database. Hospital,  physician offices, and dentists offices at least in my area always feel like they have some of the most outdated data systems I‚Äôve ever seen. Whether or not hospital managers feel like forking out money to upgrade is another question, but if they were to upgrade to something this feels like it would actually improve efficiency.

I‚Äôve heard from Oracle execs before around integration of AI in automating some data pulls. It seems like something that‚Äôs been on their radar for years. To me this seems like a value offering of their DBMS and their cloud Services. 

I‚Äôm a little skeptical on near term feasibility of the more complex things Oracle claims on automated analyses. In practice there‚Äôs so much nuance to data that I wouldn‚Äôt currently trust this to handle complex questions that require strategic thinking and business knowledge. So personally I don‚Äôt buy claims around complex analyses anytime soon. 

One other thing was Oracle is also quite literally designing data centers that would be powered by SMRs in addition to expanding their existing data center footprints. SMRs historically have been quite expensive to install, but curious to see if there are long term cost savings by doing this. 

It seems like they have a feasible vision for how the products can be used everyday and commercialized. On one hand you have companies like Tesla promising C-3PO and on the other hand companies like Oracle are promising something that feels much closer and real, with practical use cases.

What are other things you think might drive value or detract value to Oracle in the future. Do you think it‚Äôs overvalued (if so why?)? 

Also, did anyone have any interesting reads around this to share? Trying to learn more about their business plan. ",09-12-2024

"Tesla investor Ross Gerber says he's been dumping the stock because no one wants the company's cars or robotsRoss Gerber, a longtime Tesla shareholder, has expressed concern about the company's performance, stating that the used-car market is flooded with old Teslas. He recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla stock is stuck in a ""quagmire,"" prompting him to sell about $60 million worth of shares due to growing concerns about the carmaker's future.

Gerber, a vocal critic of Elon Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, revealed that he's reduced his Tesla holdings by about half, maintaining a $50 million stake. He cited a lack of confidence in Tesla's ability to achieve its goals, especially in selling more cars. ""I've been gradually lowering my position because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals they set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently,"" he said, downplaying the significance of Tesla's robotics and self-driving technology.Other Tesla investors are also becoming wary, with Tesla's stock down 13% this year amid declining sales, increased competition in China, and Musk's ongoing legal issues. Gerber noted that the market is saturated with used Teslas and mentioned his own difficulties in selling his Tesla at a fair price.

""It's really a quagmire when you have top-tier products but a CEO who's not fully engaged in the business or in selling cars,"" Gerber said. ""Sales are declining, and if you're expecting a stellar quarter, you're mistaken. Tesla is mainly selling cars at a discount now.""

Despite some analysts suggesting Tesla is undervalued as an AI company, Gerber is skeptical. He believes the demand for Tesla's humanoid robots will be minimal, especially given Musk's erratic behavior and his controversial overhaul of Twitter into X. ""The simplest way to gauge interest is to ask around, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' The answer is likely zero,"" Gerber remarked. ""Who would trust it? The last thing I need is a robot made by Elon Musk in my house."" Musk's leadership has faced increasing scrutiny from both investors and lawmakers. Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board, urging them to ensure Musk is fulfilling his financial obligations to Tesla shareholders.

"Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since MayWaymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its ""generation 6"" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.

Backing these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.

Despite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.

"Tesla Stops Taking Orders For Its Least Expensive Cybertruck ($61K), Cheapest Cybertruck Now Costs $99,990 Tesla has quietly stopped taking orders on its entry-level Cybertruck, which was originally priced at $61,000, leaving the $100,000 version as the new starting point for potential buyers. This move is a significant shift from the initial promises made by CEO Elon Musk, who in 2019 projected that the Cybertruck would cost around $40,000 and deliver over 500 miles on a single charge. Now, the least expensive model available is the dual-motor Foundation series, which is priced at $99,990 and offers a 318-mile range. This model is available for delivery as soon as this month, while the higher-end $119,990 tri-motor Cyberbeast, which has a 301-mile range, is expected to be delivered starting in October.

Despite Musk's earlier claims of having over 1 million reservations, some analysts believe that interest in the truck may not be as strong as initially expected, especially for the higher-priced models. Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights, noted that this latest move ""shows that demand is a lot less than a million trucks,"" particularly for those who were holding out for a more affordable option.

Tesla's shift to prioritize its more expensive models is a clear signal that the company is focusing on maximizing profitability, even if it means pricing out a significant portion of its potential customer base. The Cybertruck, with its unconventional trapezoidal design inspired by the ""Blade Runner"" movie and its stainless-steel body, has certainly captured the imagination of many, but the reality of its pricing and range limitations may dampen enthusiasm for some.

Sales figures show that Tesla sold nearly 4,800 Cybertrucks in July, marking its best month yet and making it the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. priced over $100,000. However, maintaining this level of sales at such high price points could prove to be a challenge. A spokesperson for Cox Automotive commented that while Tesla has sold more than 16,000 units so far, ""sustained high volume at that price point will be a challenge,"" reflecting the potential difficulty Tesla may face in maintaining strong sales numbers without a more affordable option in the lineup.

The Cybertruck‚Äôs journey to market has been fraught with delays and challenges, with deliveries only beginning in November 2023 after years of setbacks and a difficult production ramp-up. With the latest pricing strategy, Tesla seems to be betting on the allure of its high-end models to carry the day, but whether this gamble will pay off remains to be seen.

"Possible Bullish Thesis on HertzI know, I know - investors or traders have gotten the shaft on this ticker, but hear me out.

Hertz ran into *more* issues post-covid travel restrictions when Tesla marked down the price of their vehicles and accelerated the depreciation of said assets on their books (PP&E on balance sheet). There has also been seasonality regarding sales, profitability, and consumer spending is relatively contractionary for the overall sector. Their earnings have obviously been unsatisfactory, and there's been leadership and financial restructuring to *try* get things back on track. IDC about any of that really, what I care about is the strategic mistake to accelerate the sale of their EVs given the low utilization rate of EVs by their customers in the Hertz fleet.

Hertz is positioned to have one of the largest robo-taxi fleets in the world, second to only Tesla themselves to my knowledge, and Tesla can't position fleets everywhere *yet*.

* After Tesla began seriously teasing investors with the idea, companies like Lyft and Uber corrected, hard, while Hertz reached a bottom @ <$3/share with upside volatility characteristics.
* Hertz is trading at well below book value, and the PP&E depreciation will decelerate once Teslas become a profitable investment (i.e., rideshare fees > depreciation & maintenance).
* The low utilization rate by Hertz's customers will be moot if the fleet is automatically participating robo-ridesharing. They will be utilized, at least more so than previous reporting periods.

If Hertz slows or ceases selling their EVs for short term liquidity, once robo-taxi platform rolls out, Hertz has a new revenue stream with their existing assets. The depreciation will slow or reverse, their low utilization rate will subside, and their profitability will increase dramatically.

There's a lot of ***ifs*** in this scenario, but if this happens, I think Hertz will *at least* trade at book value ( > $6.25/share) indicating over 75% upside by the end of this year. If profitability continued to grow from robo-taxi fees, and if Hertz accomplishes higher profitability over the next several years from this while increasing utilization rates, their EPS will go profitable again which if sustainable we're looking at over $10-20/share in the coming years.

What are your thoughts?  
Do you see value in this thesis?  
Do you have a strong counter argument?

Looking forward to your thoughts. Thanks!",08-06-2024

"How This Door Handle Cost Tesla Half Of My Investmentüí∏Today I arrived in Bangkok with my girlfriend and ordered us to Grab (Taxi) to get us to the hotel. I've heard about BYD before and that it's the Chinese Tesla, but I'd never expected to be driven in one of those cars for $2.63 through the midst of Bangkok traffic for over 30 minutes.

If you take a look at the design features and changes Tesla's made over the last couple of years, the companies beginning and Elon Musk of course, it's obvious that they're trying to revolutionize the electric vehicle market with features like the Yoke Steering Wheel, the outer door handles and much much more.

However, if you look at the company BYD, how cheap they are producing their vehicles, how amazing the design and the quality is in general, you won't be able not to be amazed what China's done in that regard as well.

One thing that struck me the most is the inner door handle...

https://preview.redd.it/lyt5r3kmn3cd1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe179e72d777caf49e6d8c0e66ec800f6f39d34a

Sounds weird, but think about it: How either unnatural or unnecessarily cumbersome are the inner handles of car doors?

Either you have to pull the handle with one arm and push the door with the other handle, or you bend your fingers in an unnatural angle to the side, pulling in a curve to push the door open with your elbow.

This might not be one of the most important topics when talking about a car and most people probably never thought of this as a problem or inconvenient, but if you've read the book Atomic habits, you might know where I'm going with this.

James Clear at one point goes into detail about a racing bike team that improved every single little detail in their lifes to get every little advantage over the competition they could get.

Needless to say that after dozens of little improvements, they became impressively successful, making history for their country in this sport.

I believe the same to be true for companies, their culture, their product and their team. And in the case of BYD it definitely applies in a bunch of cases, just like it did with Tesla a couple of years ago (and still does).

I've been an investor in Tesla since 2016 because I believed in the product and Elon Musk and made good money owning the stock, however with Tesla becoming/being a blue chip stock, not a growth stock anymore the percentage gain is going to be limited compared to BYD, which is until now rarely represented in the western world compared to Tesla.

Tesla's got a Market Cap of 839.59 Billion vs BYD being at 96.16 Billion, which would mean BYD has about an 8x to go until it catches up with Tesla. And I'm expecting higher prices on Tesla too...

https://preview.redd.it/pnc5gnmsn3cd1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba5c2e8b2be1dcdd27e20bc81f604e2f627b7beb

When I talked to a friend at Mercedes a couple of days ago, he told me that China's investing so much money into the research of Electric Vehicles and the development of batteries that many European projects and car companies already gave up as they don't have the funding and resources provided by the Chinese Government.

Seeing how China's developed over the last 10 - 20 years and investments into modern technology, they've already passed by most Western countries, if they keep that trajectory going, they'll be miles ahead 10 years from now.

"Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian (RIVN)Let‚Äôs talk about Rivian (RIVN)

Roughly 2 years ago I saw my first Rivian truck in the wild in my local suburbs of Cincinnati‚Ä¶ since then I‚Äôve seemingly seen more and more every month. 

Is this is similar trend in other cities in the US? - if so does this mean Rivian may be a worthy investment? ‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt researched the company much but feel like this is a trend worth noting that has me interested in investing. 

So I ask : is this reason enough to invest in Rivian? Could its business model follow the footsteps of Tesla (or even come remotely close?) at $15 a share I‚Äôm beginning to get FOMO and asking myself ‚Äúwhy not buy 100 shares and see what happens?‚Äù

"RIVN: To Buy or Not to Buy? A Comprehensive AnalysisThere's been a lot of discussion about Rivian (RIVN) lately, with opinions split between supporters and skeptics. Some are even comparing RIVN to Tesla, with analyst Gary Black suggesting ""RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019."" Let's break down the pros and cons of RIVN as we know them:

# Positive Factors

The main factor is Volkswagen's recent $5B investment, which has significantly extended the liquidity runway.

[Data by The Asian Investor, seekingalpha.com](https://preview.redd.it/yaykx1avd59d1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea76e2e72d388f4e794ba64a8eadeb11da8f97ee)

**Additional key considerations:**

1. Strong balance sheet with $7.9B cash/investments as of Q1 2024
2. New factory in progress + tax incentives for existing facility
3. Positive sentiment around trucks and vans, with super loyal fanbase
4. R&D in Serbia, reducing costs
5. Shifting to base platform + add-ons model
6. New R2 model has more reservations than total yearly production
7. Potential for expanded partnerships.
8. Expected gross profit by year-end could boost stock to $20-25 range

Thanks to u/bluecap for additional insights from previous discussion.

# Challenges

Declining cash balance and high cash burn rate during production ramp-up since FY 2022 is a main risk.

[RIVN Cash and Short Term investments, takeprofit.com](https://preview.redd.it/dj9jdw6yd59d1.png?width=2545&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb6a6813e1d3d7941e1835d5639766028a1af9f)

Competition from established automakers and Chinese EV manufacturers is important to consider as the market becomes increasingly competitive.

* Current P/S ratio of 1.8x, below 3-year average of 3.0x
* Average 12-month price target from 23 analysts: **$14.52** (range $8-$21)

# Technical Analysis

[Chart and analysis by takeprofit.com\/@mustermann84](https://preview.redd.it/7nc6yyt3e59d1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc8530008238aa27c0566f25c1875b06e5b5bded)

* Weekly chart indicates a possible trend reversal (depicted as a ""Black Swan"" pattern resembling a head and shoulders formation)
* Possible interim price targets in identified cluster zones
* MACD indicates a potential long-term reversal 

# Conclusion

Rivian's profile has improved significantly, addressing previous concerns. The Volkswagen investment is a game-changer for risk mitigation. However, cash burn remains a concern, with negative free cash flow of $1.5B in Q1 2024. The new investment extends the runway to 8-9 quarters, reducing immediate financial pressure.

I will closely monitor Rivian's performance and how it handles challenges, especially from Chinese rivals.

"Rivian / The technology merger with VW has awakened the Black Swan pattern.# Expectations for both companies are very high and could be a significant step against competitors from the Far East. Will this be enough to keep the German automotive industry competitive?

# The weekly chart currently presents a noteworthy situation.

[Black Swan Pattern ](https://preview.redd.it/uoymop1yx49d1.png?width=3660&format=png&auto=webp&s=63fbaa0ad8bbdfd7e3a140f33213bd35c1adb1a7)

# 

¬†There is a so-called Black Swan pattern, which in technical analysis stands for a trend reversal.¬†The target determination of this harmonic pattern typically occurs in two retracements.

* The smaller Fibonacci is the so-called conservative retracement.
* ¬†The longer-term Fibonacci is called the aggressive retracement.

For the technical analyst, the cluster zones marked in the yellow boxes are of particular interest as possible (interim) price targets. In this context, the open gap and the MACD are also noteworthy, structurally represented as a head and shoulders formation on the chart.¬†

How do you view the merger, and do you see a realistic chance for VW to assert itself against BYD and Tesla with this collaboration? The chart at least offers a perspective on a fruitful collaboration.",06-27-2024

I understand some things have been proven over time, like ETFs boglehead philosophy etc. time in the market over timing the market but what about words like ""be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy?""


When you are young, let's say early 20s, this is the time to take risks isn't it? Every right risk you take now, compounds like crazy, every mistake? You are young you can still recover and learn.



I'm not saying dump 100% like wallstreetbets gambling, but I'm talking about investing in stuff you believe in, despite the temporary bad financials or pr or being undervalued?



For example, I am a software/hardware engineering student, and I was a gamer as a child. I knew a lot about companies like Intel, AMD, Nvidia etc. In college I knew Nvdia was gonna blow up because of CUDA and what not, AMD would blow intel out of the way, QCOM I was a fan of because I did some research on their chips. These are very entry level knowledge, but if it's enough for me to believe in working for these companies, isn't it enough to invest let's say 10%, 20%? Instead of dumping all into HYSA T bills and VTI/VOO VXUS etc and using 5% for individual picks?



If shit goes down market goes down, I saw the covid crash happen infront of my eyes, I had 10k savings from my first internship, I could have bought these shares I believed so much in, but I didn't, it stayed in a HYSA. Sure you might not pick tesla before the run or nvidia, but you can pick amzn msft goog amd and if all these become bad picks and fail me then I don't think I should work for the tech industry right? 



If tech fails I fail because thats what I'm going into, and if I can risk my career for a job in such a ""volatile"" market then why can't I ""risk"" 30-50% of my portfolio in the same tier companies?



Can someone experienced help me out with these thoughts? To me at this age it seems like VOO will get you the american dream comfortably, but VOO and good picks will make you rich, and if the market really fails dotcom and whatnot, you have to keep faith in the market and keep earning, some company will rise and if you are in the scene you will know about it, right? Could people, in tech, working for cisco or nokia, really not see the future of aapl and msft back in the early 2000s? Was it really that blinding? ",06-13-2024

"Fear that I've already missed out (the opposite of FOMO)?I have a bad tendency to see a company or industry and think ""heh... I wish I bought in a few years ago. Then, rather than buying in with that realization, I talk myself out of it. ""How much more can it really go up?"" I don't know... Examples: Netflix and UNH in 2015ish. LLY when it was $200. I've since watch both explode and its like ""damn! why did I talk myself out of those positions when I knew I still liked those companies?"" Those are the most obvious misses I've made.

I'm curious how you determine when you've missed your opportunity. I'm not worried about stocks that I was never interested in. I don't care if I missed Tesla because it was something I never felt I understood enough to want. I dodged a bullet with the marijuana crazy because I didn't think most companies were a safe long-term bet. But, there were stocks that I wanted to buy but didn't have the liquidity to pick up then when I got the liquidity, I'm like ""is now the best time to buy? Its already doubled since I was ready to enter."" 

I'm currently don't have much liquidity so I'm not buying. But, by the end of the year, I should have $20-30k freed up. And, if some of the stocks I'm currently interested in go up, I might get it in my head that I missed the opportunity already and just put the money somewhere ""safer."" Besides the argument that over an x number of years, almost all stocks go up... what other methodology do you use to determine whether you should still buy a stock and when to admit that you've missed out.",06-12-2024

Tesla shareholder sues Musk for alleged $7.5 billion insider trading,06-02-2024
The Growth of Top Tech Stocks ( 5-yr period),05-30-2024
"Are You Proud of the Companies You Invest In?Hey!

In 2012, I was one of the first people in my circle to invest in Tesla. I remember talking to my friends and coworkers about how Elon was going to take over the planet with EVs and improve everyone's lives. I was proud to be a Tesla shareholder. That was all I talked about for months. I read all the press releases, earnings reports, and niche forums to extract information about the company's future. I even flew to some of their events, lol.

Nowadays, it feels like most people (including myself) care less about what the companies they invest in stand for.

1. Do you guys still feel proud to be shareholders of XYZ?
2. How important is it for you to share the values of the companies in your portfolio?
3. How much emphasis do you put on a company's values before investing?

Maybe I'm a hopeless romantic but there's no way we all just became speculators...",05-26-2024

"BYD Company (Chinese Stock) 

**BYD Company Stock (Chinese Stock)**

**My Thesis:**

BYD is unknown, undervalued and currently growing at a very aggressive rate and has a lot of future potential to do well.

In 2023 Q4, BYD overtook Tesla in the number of EV sales (526000 BYD to 484000 Tesla) meaning it became the number one EV player in the market. At the rate BYD is growing at, they will be a dominant force in the market in the years to come when cars transition to electric.

However there are many risks associated with a new, upcoming car brand in the industry of automotives particularly as it is a Chinese company. 

**Pros of BYD**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l4uygiuo47mc1.png?width=1425&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b5e265ae4b72a5f6ee754ca9adafef3825dca7

**BYD** as a whole is growing at a very aggressive rate from almost doubling its revenue from 2021 to 2022. As it looks to expand into new horizons, there is more potential for growth as it taps into Europe, Southeast Asia, Mexico and Brazil where they have only begun rolling out their EVs in 2022/2023.

Strong balance sheet

Cash 51,471 Billion CNY

Debt (Current 11,618 + Long Term 10,211) =  21,829 Billion CNY

Cash is double debt

From 2020 - 2022 BYD has been free cash flow positive.

BYD is undervalued compared to Tesla (28/2/24) at time of writing

**BYD Ratios**

PS 0.92

PB 4.09

P/E 18.64

EV/EBITDA 12.55

**Tesla Ratios**

PS 6.56

PB 10.14

P/E 46.9 

EV/EBITDA 41.24 

Vertical Integration allows BYD to keep EVs at an affordable price to help maximize its sales. Instead of purchasing parts/components from external companies, BYD makes most of its components by itself e.g. batteries, IGBT transistors (2 of the most expensive parts) and electronic components. The only parts BYD reported that they don‚Äôt make are the windows and tires.

BYD is heavily supported by the Chinese government through subsidies to help lower costs for them which allows BYD cars to be sold at a very affordable cost for consumers particularly in the Asian markets.

**Challenges + Risks** 

BYD is relatively unknown in the automobile industry and tapping into developed markets like Germany, Japan and America will be very difficult. There will be challenges in convincing consumers to transition from well-known brands with much longer history such as Toyota and Volkswagen etc... This is particularly true with the skepticism surrounding EVs and Chinese companies in general.

BYD experienced this issue when they tried to sell their electric bus fleets in North America back in 2015. However, through successful marketing and branding strategies BYD managed to win consumers and now 50% of electric buses are from BYD. There is a big question whether BYD is able to market strategically and convince the public of its electric cars.

Heavy tariffs placed on BYD in Europe/America will severely cut BYD‚Äôs margins where we are seeing 25% tariffs in the likes of America combined with the difficulty of marketing their EVs to the public. This is due to the ‚Äúunfair playing advantages‚Äù BYD has had from Chinese government subsidies. [EU anti-subsidy probe into electric vehicle imports from China | Think Tank | European Parliament (europa.eu)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2023)754553#:~:text=On%204%20October%202023%2C%20the,vehicles%20(BEVs)%20from%20China.) There is also a question of what will happen in the future if the Chinese government reduces the subsidies it is giving to BYD.

Currently most of BYD‚Äôs revenue is from China so there are risks associated with how the Chinese economy does. But BYD is looking to diversify by expanding globally as mentioned previously.

One of the biggest risks is the ‚ÄúChina Risk‚Äù. We have seen crackdowns in large Chinese companies like Alibaba and Tencent due to their market dominance, unfair competition and fraudulent practices. As a result we have seen Chinese stocks plummeting down and losing a lot of value in recent years. Whether BYD will be a target of this when they grow further in the future is a red flag for many investors.

There has been a recent announcement by Biden that Chinese EVs will be banned in America due to safety issues and it is possible that European countries may follow in the footsteps of America and the bans could spread to the developed Western countries (Australia, Canada, Western Europe) etc. This is certainly a big risk to BYD's opportunity to expand into the Western markets as they have just recently set up new bases in the likes of Germany and Australia. Future revenues will take a big hit and earnings potentials will be seriously limited if this is the case. The geopolitical tensions between the West and China is a major risk factor we have to account for.

**Summary**

In conclusion, BYD presents an interesting investment opportunity. The company has demonstrated impressive growth, overtaking Tesla in EV sales and expanding into new markets. Its strong balance sheet, positive free cash flow, and undervaluation compared to Tesla suggest potential for significant upside. Vertical integration and government subsidies have allowed BYD to keep prices competitive and penetrate markets effectively. While there are challenges, such as tapping into developed markets and navigating tariffs, BYD has shown resilience and adaptability in the past. The company's efforts to diversify its revenue streams and expand globally mitigate risks associated with its reliance on the Chinese market. Recent announcements of potential bans in Western countries could pose a significant threat to BYD‚Äôs expansion plans. While the ""China Risk"" is a concern, BYD's track record and strategic positioning make it a promising stock for investors looking to capitalize on the growing EV market and the transition to electric vehicles particularly in the developing countries.

**My Take:**

Yes we have seen the large crackdown on big tech stocks in China. However, BYD works closely with the government and is supported through subsidies, incentives and government support so it is in BYD's interest to follow CCP's policies and regulations. China recognizes that they are facing a global warming crisis and are transitioning to ""clean up"" their country through switching to EVs so it is in the CCP's interest to work with BYD. The world is larger than America/Europe and there is a huge market in the developing nations. I recognize that there are many risks in investing in BYD but for the valuation it is currently at, I believe it is undervalued and there is significant potential in the years to come. ",03-03-2024

When it comes to the guidance from the investment companies, do you go off what they say with their research tools? If not, how do you determine when to give up on your stinkers?

"[OC] The case for Peloton (PTON) 3 points to consider:&#x200B;

There is no doubt that Peloton stock has had a roller coaster ride since 2020.

When Peloton IPO'd in 2019, it was priced around $25-$30 a share.  When COVID hit in 2020 (and the lockdowns began), Peloton was positioned perfectly to capitalize on the millions of customers who could longer go and workout at gyms or even their workplaces. This drove Peloton's sales and subscriber growth exponentially and is what helped it's stock skyrocket going from $25 to $151 (+600% gain) by December 1, 2020. Peloton was the darling of Wallstreet. Then, the lockdowns lifted, and with it, Peloton saw its vast army of customers begin to return to their normal lives, and gyms. The growth estimates were proven to be wildly optimistic, and Peloton itself failed to scale/manage it's growth properly resulting in its stock to fall almost over 95% in the last few years resulting in today's share price of $4.33.

This huge fall in price in such a short time, is something that can easily skew investors opinion of the stock especially if that investor bought in to Peloton when it was at its high of $150- there were many people who fell victim to the  ""sunk cost fallacy"" trap. Which states: ""It is irrational to use irrecoverable costs to justify a present decision. If we acted rationally, only future costs and benefits would be taken into account.""  In other words, investors holding PTON while it fell and fell. The ""sunk cost fallacy"" way of thinking can make it extremely difficult to be objective on any investment.  Or, put another way, Peloton's meteoric rise and fall could be seen as a Value trap.

**Points to consider:**

It is unrealistic to think Peloton can return to its pandemic era stock valuation of $151 in the near term, however It is also equally unrealistic to treat Peloton as if its business (not just the stock) has lost 95% of its value in the last few years. All of the below points have caveats, I understand the risks Peloton still has to manage to truly be considered as ""turning the corner"", however, I believe that Peloton is oversold with much of the well documented bad news already priced in. So below are some positive  things I found in my DD about Peloton.

1. **Peloton Price advantage**:  I own a Peloton tread, and what I found surprising was Pelotons price point to buy a Peloton treadmill was **$3,000**. (I remembered peloton in 2019 being in the news for being the ""treadmill for the rich"" as it cost close to $20,000).  I first noticed this price difference when purchasing treadmills for a new gym a couple months ago. For comparison, a Precore TRM 835 Treadmill costs $10,795.00 (the TRM 835 has none of the user experience/interface/connectivity that peloton has). In addition, Peloton's monthly membership, priced currently at $12.99 a month which is cheaper than a gym membership. Its subscription services is robust and is always adding new features.  It gives you access to Peloton's vast library of top of the line instructor classes and so much other content  (i.e.I found the new ""video game"" feature on the treadmill i found to be engaging and fun).
2. **Peloton is an industry disruptor.** It has taken a bland, and relatively unchanged market of at home fitness equipment to a whole different level. Peloton's brand power, and unique positioning as the ""household"" name for at home fitness should not be underestimated. Where they differ from other fitness equipment makers is in their user experience and the quality of their machines with large Tesla like touchscreens, their community of trainers/users, and their ability to constantly upgrade the tread software over the cloud. Being a disruptor in any industry justifies a higher p/e (or in Pelaton's case) patience for the company to become profitable, Peloton is
3. **""Great product not a great stock""** \- analyst on CNBC.  I think this is a common belief among wallstreet. , I see this sentiment as illogical and indicative of a buying opportunity. The idea that a stock is somehow ""separate"" from the product its company produces is exactly where the opportunity is to invest resides. What the analyst was possibly alluding to was looking at Peloton quantitatively (by its numbers, growth estimates, revenues etc...) peloton may not look like a great stock- But looking at it qualitatively, Peloton looks ""great""., I see this sentiment as a possible opportunity, Bad products lead to bad stocks. Conversely,  good products (generally speaking) lead to good stocks. A good product/business will eventually be reflected in the stock if the company can keep producing this product, and if significant ""moats"" exist to protect its market share. Currently, I do not know of any other at-home fitness company can be compared apples to apples to Peloton. Peloton has a huge head start and significant 'moat' around its business.

I would love to hear anyone else's opinions on Peloton being undervalued/overvalued.

- Deliveries +20% YoY to 485k‚úÖ

Overall, #expectations from #analysts were narrowly missed, yet the long-term perspective for #Tesla remains exceptionally attractive. AI and robotics will increasingly come into focus.

#Sales
Vehicle deliveries increased from 405,278 to 484,507, a 20% rise from Q4-2022 to Q4-2023. Elon Musk hinted in the conference call that Tesla's FY24 Volume growth ""may be notably lower.""

#Revenue
Increased from $24.32 bn. to $25.2 bn. - a moderate growth of 3.6%. Despite increased deliveries, lower prices per vehicle & an unfavorable model mix (more lower-priced models) dampened the revenue increase.

#Margin
Declined from 16% to 8.2% - here the price reductions & higher production costs due to the Cybertruck are evident. Operating income fell from $3.89 bn. to $2.06 bn. Another positive note is the increase in EBIT margin compared to Q3-2023 at 7.6% - the bottom has been passed!

#EPS (Adjusted)
This fell from $1.19 to $0.71, a 40% decrease. Despite a one-time tax benefit of $1.56 per share (or $5.9 bn.), the decline in profitability metrics could not be offset.

#FreeCashflow & #Cash
Jumped from $1.42 bn. to $2.06 bn. (+45%). As a result, the cash balance increased from $22.2 bn. to $29.1 bn. (+31%). This demonstrates Tesla's ability to efficiently generate and utilize capital - even in challenging times!

#Guidance
Despite the solid figures, the guidance for 2024 remains cautious. Expected lower growth rates in vehicle volume could cool growth, while the focus is on the next generation of vehicles (Model 2/A in 2025 for $25,000).",01-25-2024
"Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:

https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541

Data Sources:

* SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã
* SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)

**Key Observations:**

* Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA.
* Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY.
* Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.

It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.

I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:

1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market.
2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy.
3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results.
4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy.
5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform.
6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.

It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.

"Nikola (NKLA) thoughts?The expert evaluation is technically Hold, understandably so.  To me it looks like a cheap penny stock to maybe explode in a few years. Company was worth 80$ per share in 2020, although based on lies the company told their investors, which he‚Äôs doing 4 year time in prison for now.  But to see the gains like that, and where they‚Äôre at now, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to throw 5 grand at it now .80cents per share, to potentially be  $40,000 in a few year if they get back to where they were ? 

The company did develop and sell 35 hydrogen powered electric heavy trucks last year, the first of their rollout.  Those trucks do currently have a recall that they‚Äôre fixing. 

Given the scandal years ago , and the mechanical troubles now I definitely feel the apprehension, but the company is resilient and considered by some to be in a hiccups stage, potentially rising to a Tesla of the workforce so to speak someday.

"Tesla: How about its inventory level?A lot of posts are talking about Tesla's production and deliveries in 2023, thus would like to look into the numbers from another perspective.

# INVENTORY

https://preview.redd.it/omsupf0ar1ac1.jpg?width=424&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2309e6cfc9f615286d06e98ab7bb200c91aa9c13

When we look at the production and deliveries numbers between 2021 and 2023, it is not difficult to identify that the aggregate production is larger than the aggregate deliveries \[note: -5,750 for FY2021, +55,760 for FY2022 and +37,404 for FY2023\].

With the fierce competition observed in the market (lead to price slash and hence decline in gross profit margin) as well as the loss of tax credit / green benefits in 2024 (lead to possible lower demand for some of its core products), wonder if inventory will become a problem for the company in future.

The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)

&#x200B;

The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.

&#x200B;

It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.

&#x200B;

The 10 top performing days for the S&P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.

&#x200B;

Through Dec. 22, the S&P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.

&#x200B;

Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.

&#x200B;

Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.

&#x200B;

Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.

&#x200B;

The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.

&#x200B;

The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.

&#x200B;

SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.

&#x200B;

Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.

&#x200B;

See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?

&#x200B;

Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.

&#x200B;

The S&P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:

&#x200B;

The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.

&#x200B;

Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.",12-27-2023

"Needing some advice on the marketI‚Äôm not a pro or at any way a crazy stock trader I just put money into what I think is reliable, which is I only own Tesla. I would like to have a diverse portfolio and searching different articles for other ‚Äúreliable‚Äù stocks to invest in. I know nothing is ‚Äúreliable‚Äù but there are definitely some that are safer than others. If I could get some advice from the some people and what they have invested in that would be great. I usually put money in for long term. For example I put money into Tesla about 5 years ago and still have it in. So anything that would be a good long term investment. Also just simple trading advice like where you guys get your info from on stocks or even what to look for to determine if a stock is going to go down or up would be great. Thank you!",11-08-2023

"What would you do in this situation? Serious responses only pleaseBought 500 shares of TSLA at $276 a few months back.

I‚Äôm thinking I have two options:

A - Ride it out and check back in a few years. The thing is, half of these I bought on margin so I‚Äôm paying interest every month to baghold these. I can afford to not sell the position because I‚Äôm bullish long term on Tesla and I don‚Äôt need this money now, but man it hurts watching it just go deeper and deeper.

B - sell short dated covered calls (monthlies) with a few strikes above current market since the $280C are pretty much worthless right now. But if the stock turns around in the short term, then I could be totally screwed.

Any thoughts?",10-26-2023
"P/E ratio for growth stocksShould you use the median P/E ratio (last 5years) of growth stocks to value them? I know that P/E ratio above 30- 35 are difficult to keep over long period of times, but many growth stocks have median P/E ratios than exceed 35 by a lot. So it's ok to suppose that a growth stock will match its median P/E ratio again or should I use a lower p/ e ratio for the estimates(maybe the median P/E ratio for companies in the same industry? )
In general, how long can growth stocks keep a high P/E ratio?
As an example I have Tesla. Right now is P/E ratio is 68. And its median P/E ratio last years was 179. So will Tesla have a similar P/E (especially if they grow as analyst expect) or which p/ e ratio would you use for the next 3 years at least 

I hope I can be understood, I am still new in investing, but there are some stuff that still confuse me. If you could help me, I would appreciate a lot :)

"Taking a look at tsla financials 

Cut me some slack here because I don't follow tesla that much. Feel free to point out anything that may be incorrect

That being said.....

1. First image shows production/delivery metrics. To summarize, we broke the uptrend with this quarter on both production/delivery, however we are still up year over year

2. This second image shows the YOY Revenue changes. If you pay attention to the quarters, you can also see that quarter over quarter we've declined as well.

3. This image shows a table of margins both year over year and quarter over quarter. You can clearly see the yoy was in the green for a long time but in 2023, took a sizable hit from all these rate hikes and price cuts.

4. This is their income statement. Highlighted are some metrics you may want to pay attention to, some of which I've covered. Notice EPS is down almost half from the prior year same quarter.

[https://i.postimg.cc/14hH9ZbZ/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/14hH9ZbZ/image.png)

5. The balance sheet looks pretty solid. Their cash position is growing over the quarters, their current asset to current liability ratio looks much better than the prior year, and equity has gone up (keep in mind so have shares outstanding)

[https://i.postimg.cc/9MGXx6Zn/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9MGXx6Zn/image.png)

6. Free cashflow has been going down. In the second picture you can see the breakdown which is a combination of lower cash from operations and higher capital expenditures.

Unfortunately we don't have the q-3 SEC filings for more details

[https://i.postimg.cc/W4ZJvf0M/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/W4ZJvf0M/image.png)

7. From q2 SEC filings we can see that interest rates going up are not all bad for tesla. Clearly their interest income went up 815%. You might think interest income is not a big deal, but look again. Go back to point 4 and look at the income statement. **Interest income makes up 15.76% of their net income.**

I am all for passive ETF investing while my friend thinks that he can pick exceptionally performing stocks easily and thinks he can continue to earn a tidy profit by investing in Apple or Tesla.

So my understanding is it's difficult to accurate pick stocks for laymen like us. But besides that, I want to know if there were any companies in history where everyone thought the stock price will just keep going up and up and nobody could have thought the prices will dip and eventually it did and never recovered?

And also, what are you opinions on whether the current set of big tech firms that seems so invincible now, will they go down that path?

How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,09-28-2023
Charge pointI initially decided to invest couple of thousand into charge point stock after installing them at work (I am an electrician). Looking up into it they have 300k locations which made me believe that at lest the company somewhat knows what it‚Äôs doing (even though it hasn‚Äôt been profitable) and won‚Äôt go bankrupt and at the point of my investment it was 8 dollars a share which seemed fairly low from the looks of the chart. With Tesla teaming up with other car manufacturers to use their charge stations now the stock just seems to keep going lower and lower. Is it a lost cause or should I DCA. Thanks,09-25-2023

"Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming yearSo I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.

I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.

However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.

I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.

The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)

Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)

So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?

Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :)",07-17-2023

&#x200B;

**1)** **Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**

Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.

**2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**

Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.

**3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**

As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.

**4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**

Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.

"What Am I Missing?Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis). 

Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.

But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices. 

FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings

ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share

TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.

From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.

So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...

So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?",06-29-2023

Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.

I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.

The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.

We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.

I smell blood, and I think you do too.

Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.

Even with that lowball number, Tesla‚Äôs got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That‚Äôs like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.

Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: üñï

These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.

So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts‚Äô expectations out of the water.

tl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.

"Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions 

Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company‚Äôs record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.

Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla‚Äôs NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.

GM‚Äôs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.

Nonetheless, it hasn‚Äôt all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck‚Äôs capabilities.

Preproduction ‚Äúalpha‚Äù versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still ‚Äúastounded‚Äù that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.",06-14-2023

"What's going on with Rivian?Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the company‚Äôs share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?

One bright spot has been the company‚Äôs increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivian‚Äôs future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% increase. Also, Rivian executives stressed their plans for profitability, which sent stock prices soaring.¬†

However, some larger issues still remain. Rivian is being forced to compete not only with rival Tesla, but other legacy automakers jumping into the EV race such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company. If Rivian doesn‚Äôt establish a strong foothold in the electric vehicle market soon, it may lose its opportunity to establish a presence in this growing market.¬†

I believe Rivian is an all-or-nothing play. Investing in the stock is extremely risky. However, the stock is poised for explosive returns if the company can work out its financial issues and deliver quality products to millions of customers that demand them. Currently, the company sits on $12 billion in cash and just shy of $3 billion in debt. According to FactSet, the target price for Rivian Automotive is $23.95, which reflects positive sentiment for the company even as it struggles.",06-06-2023
"regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans, sends valuation to $5bnElon Musk's company, Neuralink, which is developing technology to implant chips in human brains, is now valued at around $5 billion.

This valuation increase is due to some investors purchasing stock and the recent U.S. regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans.

The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.

Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.

After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.

**why is this important?**

1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested.
2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology.
3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology.
4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink.
5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.

"Anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies via asset management companies?Hey lads! I‚Äôm sure everyone by now is pretty aware of the AI and robotics space as it‚Äôs literally all over the place right now. People like Elon Musk have been talking about it a lot recently and Tesla also just put out their newest iteration of their bots on LinkedIn which was pretty cool to see. I‚Äôve always been amazed at how robots are able to do tasks in the same capacity we do so seeing it come to fruition is pretty insane to me.

I always do my best to keep up with news in the space to see if there‚Äôs any cool advancements or new jobs that these robots are taking on. That being said I saw today that ‚ÄúUnited Drug‚Äù who is one of Ireland‚Äôs largest pharmaceutical distributors has just brought in a whole squad of autonomous robots..and when I say squad I mean 21 robots lmao. That‚Äôs almost enough for a soccer match lol. The company partnered with LocusBots to make this happen which I found pretty cool because I had heard about them working with DHL and UPS before. Apparently these robots are able to navigate autonomously through the warehouse and assist the human staff (thought I‚Äôd add the human part on just incase lol) with handling orders. It‚Äôs suppose to increase overall productivity of the warehouse, which I feel like is going to be the case when you add in robotics in any capacity to somewhere. I wonder if robots are eventually going to eliminate a whole bunch of jobs in the near future.. What yall think? I feel like i can easily see robots operating a warehouse.

After reading through the article I wanted to check out LocusBots a bunch more and invest in them. Cause if they are making big splashes like this in major companies around the world I want to be in on them. It was annoying to find out that they‚Äôre a private company lol

I did however come across Stack Capital while doing my search into investing into Locus. From what I gathered Stack Capital invests in equity, debt, and/or other securities of growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I seen that in their portfolio they had already invested $8m into LocusBots back in 2022 so this could potentially be a good way to indirectly invest in them right? From the looks of it they have a pretty solid management team with a whole bunch of experience so I‚Äôm not super worried about their judgement when it comes to portfolio management.

Does anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies this way? I‚Äôve personally never done it so I‚Äôm not 100% sure on it. I really love the look of Locus so I would really love to get some insight into companies like Stack and if they‚Äôre a good shout or not.",05-30-2023

"4 rental properties & home paid off, no mortgages/loans. 30 years old. What should I invest in with an additional $100k? (Advice Needed)**Hi team.**

**I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.

**My current investments are the following:**

* 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.)
* My home (Paid off).
* 2 Stocks (NIO & Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share.
* My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).

I have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).

My monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).

I know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.

So, I've heard the term ""mutual funds"" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms ""HYSA and Money market funds"". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).

So now, I plan to change how I manage my money.

**What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.

**What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**

1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account.
2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account.
3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF).
4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.

So, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.

**My questions are:**

1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy?
2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.

P.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.

I appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.",05-28-2023

"Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock. 

## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.

The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.

It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.

Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.

Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.

 

## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance

During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:

* Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year;
* Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.

Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.

Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.

While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS).¬†

 By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.

Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss. ¬†

Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.

 

## Didn't see this coming

Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.

Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile.¬†

While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business.¬†

 

## Is the stock a buy?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ejok5t214q0b1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=07eb3d2aa3cc50571a3de7cb8c4eb82190d7c22e

 

In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify.¬†

After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.

Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.

Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.¬†¬†

I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.",05-19-2023

Overall, this is what I wanted to see in a Full Self Driving vehicle.

However, Florida roads will have a unique challenge. Here, we use double lines on our major roads, see photo of road. I have no idea why, I assume it‚Äôs something to do with premium lanes like HOV or Express Lanes‚Ä¶ but in this instance, the software sees 2 unbroken lines, and refuses to cross (see Tesla screen). I held off disengaging for over 3 miles, until it took me past my exit having refused to cross. It did try, by turning on the turn signal, then off, then on, then off probably 15 times‚Ä¶ but refused to cross despite it being broken lines.

So, Florida, Tesla, community‚Ä¶ what should it have done‚Ä¶ and what would you suggest?

"Canada EV Tariffs, will this impact Canadian Tesla prices/incentives? There may be a paywall for this article so please find it here:

Canada will impose new tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, aluminum and steel, lining up behind western allies and taking steps to protect domestic manufacturers.
The government plans to announce a 100% levy on electric cars and 25% on steel and aluminum, according to people familiar with the matter, speaking on condition they not be identified because the matter is still private. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to unveil the policy in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he‚Äôs gathered with the rest of his cabinet for a series of meetings about the economy and foreign relations.
Canada, an export-driven economy that relies heavily on trade with the US, has been closely watching moves by the Biden administration to erect a much higher tariff wall against Chinese EVs, batteries, solar cells, steel and other products. Canada‚Äôs auto sector is heavily integrated with that of its closest neighbor: The vast majority of its light vehicle production ‚Äî which was 1.5 million units last year ‚Äî is exported to the US.
Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, the most powerful person in Trudeau‚Äôs cabinet, has been one of the most prominent voices in favor of a harder approach to Chinese vehicle exports, and becoming a closer trade ally with the US.

In June, she announced a public consultation on possible measures to make it more difficult for Chinese companies to sell electric vehicles in the Canadian market. The auto industry, she said, is ‚Äúfacing unfair competition from China‚Äôs intentional, state-directed policy of overcapacity that is undermining Canada‚Äôs EV sector‚Äôs ability to compete.‚Äù
In July, Freeland went further. During an interview with Bloomberg News, she said the tariffs consultation might go beyond electric cars.
‚ÄúGeopolitics and geoeconomics is back,‚Äù she said at the time. ‚ÄúThat means that Western countries‚Äî and very much the US ‚Äî is putting a premium on secure supply chains and is taking a different attitude towards Chinese overcapacity.‚Äù
‚ÄòNo Illusion‚Äô
The European Union has also announced proposed new tariffs on electric vehicles important from China, though at lower levels than the US and now Canada are proposing.
Products made by SAIC Motor Corp. face additional duties of 36.3%, while Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and BYD Co. each face tariffs of 19.3% and 17%, respectively, according to a draft decision released last week. Tesla Inc. will see an extra 9% charge on Chinese-made vehicles.

Chinese leaders plan to raise the issue of tariffs when US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan visits this week, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Sullivan is due to meet with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and may also meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

China has retaliated against Canada before. It previously restricted imports of Canadian canola seed for three years ‚Äî a move seen as retribution for a decision by Canada authorities to arrest Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US extradition warrant. Meng returned to China in 2021.
The value of Chinese electric vehicles imported by Canada surged to C$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) last year, from less than C$100 million in 2022, according to data from Statistics Canada. The number of cars arriving from China at the port of Vancouver jumped after Tesla Inc. started shipping Model Y vehicles there from its Shanghai factory.
However, the Canadian government‚Äôs main concern isn‚Äôt Tesla, but the prospect of cheap cars made by Chinese automakers eventually becoming available. BYD informed the Canadian government in July that it intends to lobby lawmakers and officials about its plans to enter the country.
Trudeau also faced political and industry pressure. The Canadian auto sector had been pushing him to hike tariffs to protect domestic jobs and wages, arguing that China‚Äôs EVs are cheaper due to much weaker labor standards. The government has also bet big on automakers and manufacturers from democratic allies: the government has agreed to to multibillion-dollar subsidies for electric vehicle plants or battery factories for Stellantis NV, Volkswagen AG and Honda Motor Co., among others.
Steel and aluminum producers in Canada have also publicly and repeatedly urged the government to restrict China‚Äôs access, saying that Xi‚Äôs industrial policy allows the Asian powerhouse to unfairly flood foreign markets, putting local jobs at risk.
‚ÄúChina does not play by the rules,‚Äù Catherine Cobden, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, told reporters earlier this month. ‚ÄúGovernment should be under no illusion that they do.‚Äù",08-26-2024

"Warning: a rising number of German Users report of corroding and failing brake lines in the Tesla Model 3Hello, 

I just want to inform you that in some Tesla Model 3 ( it seems especially from 2019, but there are first reports from 2020 models, too) the brake lines seem to start corroding away. It is hidden under the frunk, but after some brake failures, people started to check their Model 3s and now more and more Model 3 have been found that seem to have started corroding there. It maybe caused by a sticker that is attached to one of the brake lines and sometimes maybe speed up by a wrong placed 12v battery vent.

But it is still not fully known what the reason is...
There were some two old posts about this problem from US users here on Reddit, too. So maybe this is a way more widespread issue...

Here is the link to the thread, where you can find pictures of the problem, too:
https://tff-forum.de/t/warnung-zur-bremsleitung-model-3/342039/1

Here is a link to the post of the report the T√úV in Germany is sending out for checking, there you can see where you find the flaws: 
[https://tff-forum.de/t/warnung-zur-bremsleitung-model-3/342039/591](https://tff-forum.de/t/warnung-zur-bremsleitung-model-3/342039/591)
But keep in mind this is one of the worst cases, it starts below often at the sticker, where you often can't see it very well.


This might be a huge security risk and even the German T√ºv is now advised to check cars for this flaws...

Tesla even seems to know about the issue since it already has ""improved parts"" to replace them since more than 2 years.

The risk of brakes failing in a dangerous situation with drivers are unaware that their brake lines corrode,  seems to be very high and a lot of cars could be affected.

For me it is really baffling that Tesla seems to know about this problem but doesn't issue a recall. 

Edit: I posted this in the model 3 reddit, too. Because I think it is a safety issue that could cause people to lose their lives. But it seems they don't like Model 3 to get informed about this and they deleted it. Very sad that the Mods of the Tesla Model 3 doesn't care about the safety of its members.",12-28-2024

"Time to say goodbye... Sold my Model Y....I like Tesla cars, really do, but I am relieved that I sold mine and bought an EQE. I took delivery of it today. I am not as giddy or excited by the EQE but I am relaxed about it.

Sooo  with the latest release of FSD we in Europe on the highways can actually use it. Up to now FSD was this half half thing that really did not work most of the time because it simply could not do the right thing.

As I was driving the car on the German autobahn I noticed how smooth everything was. I was thinking, ""ahhh really, I am about to trade my Tesla, that sucks they fixed things.""  Then as the FSD took me on the off ramp to the Mercedes dealership it decided that the off ramp road was much wider and FSD put me head first into an oncoming car taking the on ramp. I had to jerk the car hard and sevre to get out of the way.  My ""ahhh really"", turned into ""yeah I am good lets get rid of this car.""

That sums up my entire Tesla experience. It is not a bad car, but the fact that there is no front camera, no radar, no sonar, only vision makes it a REALLY bad car. Vision does not work. Tesla vision system is akin to working working working working, oops explosion not working oops sorry... There are many other little gotchas like difficulty parking tight spots, that need fixing. Yet Musk is more pre-occupied doing something else. I don't feel bad selling the car and am quite relieved. 

How is my EQE? Well it does not have FSD as worded, but has advanced driver assistance with augmented reality. Quite good actually and I am impressed. More impressed than what Tesla has brought to the table.

Thus good luck folks...

Tesla (TSLA) sales in Europe are down 14% year-to-date and it‚Äôs time to worry,12-20-2024
"Tesla Lease/Ownership QuestionI leased a model 3 in late 2022. Earlier in 2024, I decided to try to transfer the lease. I found a willing taker, and we went through Tesla's transfer process. After the taker was approved, it took us about 3 months to complete.

In the fall of 2024, Tesla emailed us both instructions on which documents to send in, what to sign, etc. Tesla then instructed us to transfer the car on a given day, and then Tesla would switch registration, app ownership, etc. Tesla sent us the signed agreement, signed by me, the assignee, and Tesla. They said the transfer was final. I thought everything was done.

Fast forward to about a week ago: Tesla sends me an overdue notice saying I haven't paid. I also receive a parking ticket in the mail for a city I haven't been to in years. Turns out, Tesla never switched the registration for the car.

I emailed Tesla to ask them to please switch the registration to the assignee's name retroactive to the transfer date. They replied saying they have no record of the transfer being approved and I should try to get the car back (!?). I sent them a copy of the signed agreement - signed by them - and forwarded a string of emails that spanned months showing that they've led me through this entire process, finalized the process, and that I followed their process every step of the way. Many of the emails on that thread were sent by the same rep that told me they have no record indicating the transfer was approved, lol. Since then, they've gone silent. (shocker).

My question is: what the heck? Has anyone else experienced this? Obviously this is there error, but should I be worried about what Tesla's incompetence can do to my credit? Can they garnish wages?

I've hired an attorney. But wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Tesla botching something, refusing to admit to their mistake, and then just going silent. And, if so, what worked to unlock the stalemate and resolve the issue.",12-19-2024
"Tesla Orders - Buyer Beware**I was suggested to cross-post this here, that it would be appreciated.  Sorry if that breaks any rules.**

Just a public service announcement. I just had to put in a BBB complaint against Tesla over one of their custom car orders.

On 11/25 I put up $250 to custom order a Tesla because I didn't like anything on the lot, and because a sales rep AND the site claimed I could get it home delivered this year. They're running a reasonably good deal (3 months FSD+Supercharger) and I'd be eligible for it. Ever since, I've had nothing but problems with them.

First, they kept swapping VINs in and out of the account, not really explaining what they wanted but constantly requesting and unrequesting Insurance info. Not a big deal, but awkward. Each time, they tried to get me to swap to one of the models on the lot that I hadn't wanted in the first place.

Then, I was informed they don't do home deliveries in MA, so I'll have to drive 60 miles when it shows up. Annoying, but I found someone willing to give me a ride into Boston.

Then I was told my car was headed to a lot by last Friday. A couple days later, I was informed that was wrong and that car isn't built yet and my VIN changed again. Then I got a message that my car (new VIN) was ready and I could pick it up at any time. When I tried to contact them to set up an appointment, I was told that they had no idea why I was told that, and there were no matching cars in the New England area at this time.

Fast-forward to today. When things get really fun. Last night I sent an angry email that I wanted an update by Monday with real dates and an understanding about this FSD deal and whether I was going to lose that. Today, a Tesla rep called me to tell me there's no way a car will be in New England by the end of the year, and to try yet again to get me to pick a car on the lot. When I refused, he kept pushing and trying to convince me of different colors and how much money I'll save if he can get me into this or that base model.

When that call ended, it turned this way. He basically said ""ok, well I'll keep the reservation open just in case a car shows up, but it'll automatically expire at the end of the year""

My response was to question the deposit. And his... that if they can't find me the matching car by the end of the year, they're keeping the money. I'm no lawyer, but when somebody gives you money for something, and you don't give them that something back, you have no claim to that money. Thus begins a (hopefully short) battle to get my deposit refunded after all of Tesla's lies.

I can't speak to product question or after-purchase quality, but PLEASE for your own sakes, do not custom order a Tesla. I mean, it might go okay for you, but it could also go how it went for me.

UPDATE for those doubting BBB.  The local Tesla branch manager just called me to process a refund of the full balance.  She did not cite the consumer board complaint, but the BBB complaint.",12-19-2024

I already know I need an home backup solution because we have not infrequent power outages for a few hours to a few days.

Generac, LG, Duracell, Fortress, and even Anker has come out with whole house battery backup solutions.

"Today is officially my DEMUSK day. I handed off my 4-year old model 3 for another car and it feels GOOD.If you own a Tesla and can afford it, I highly recommend having your own DEMUSK day (and share it here!).

My story:

1. Purchased a model 3 in September 2020. Musk at the time was annoying but bearable.
2. I just went back into my service history for the car. It's been back for repairs NINE times since I purchased it including things like:
   1. Severe cabin rattle (3 issues during the 4 years)
   2. Rear lights fogging up badly (twice)
   3. A car wash triggered a waterfall under the glovebox compartment. Passenger side was damaged. They blamed a dirt build up in the ventilator which was bullshit because it had just come back from servicing the A/C and I saw several cables sticking out under the glovebox (which I ignored at my peril).
3. The final straw was when the fake metal chrome laminate on the rear passenger door handle started to peel and come off. It felt awful when trying to open the door, nevermind how it looked. I logged a repair request under warranty but was denied as it was deemed to be ""normal wear and tear"". Ridiculous. So I just ended up cutting off the laminate with some scissors.

My car warranty expired in September so having to pay out of pocket for these things and make that cruel & lying billionaire earn more money was not going to happen.

3.	\*\*Trade-In:\*\*¬†I‚Äôm trading in my 2015 Toyota Prius, a car I‚Äôve had for over 7 years and will definitely miss. Tesla initially offered $6,300 based on the info I provided, but after sending photos, their final offer dropped to $5,000. While I know that‚Äôs low, I decided to go with them to avoid the hassle of fixing the car and selling it myself. I did check Carvana, CarMax, Driveway, and KBB, and their offers were similar, though those were based only on the initial info I provided, without photos.  
  
4.	\*\*Insurance:\*\*¬†I‚Äôm currently insured with Progressive and wanted to stay with them, but they‚Äôre asking for double my current premium if I switch to the new car. I shopped around and got a decent quote from GEICO, which is close to what I‚Äôm paying now.  
  
5.	\*\*Incentives:\*\*¬†I applied for the NJ EV income-based incentive of $2,000 (on top of the $2,000 automatic state incentive), totaling $4,000. My mistake was applying ‚Äútoo late‚Äù on the same day I placed the order during a holiday week. The approval hasn‚Äôt come through yet, so the delays in financing have actually been helpful. If everything settles in early December and the incentive still hasn‚Äôt come through, I‚Äôll move forward without it.  
  
6.	\*\*Delivery Date:\*\*¬†Since I haven‚Äôt accepted any of the offers yet, Tesla has moved my delivery date three times so far, and it may get pushed again. Does this look bad on my end, or is it normal?

Extra:¬†I saw a post saying Black Friday is the best time to get accessories for a new car, so I went ahead and ordered a bunch to be ready from Day 1.

Thanks for sticking with my (probably boring) story! Feel free to ask questions or share any recommendations if I‚Äôm missing something or doing anything wrong. Thanks, everyone!

TL;DR:

‚Ä¢	Ordered M3LR with a $500 referral; missed out on $1,000 due to timing.  
  
‚Ä¢	Financing issues: high rates, missing offers, and delays with credit unions.  
  
‚Ä¢	Tesla trade-in dropped my Prius offer from $6,300 to $5,000, but I accepted for convenience.  
  
‚Ä¢	Switched from Progressive to GEICO after a big rate hike.  
  
‚Ä¢	NJ EV incentives ($4K) delayed; may not get them before delivery.  
  
‚Ä¢	Delivery date shifted 3 times so far.",12-01-2024

"Where Tesla Lags Behind Severely It's well known that EVs require rare earth metals for components such as the motors. Tesla is no exception. 

But an important point to note is that Tesla needs to be nice to China to get those parts. Hence, why you never see Elon attack China and why Trump wants to kick out the EV subsidy for now. 

If China is upset, then Tesla owners are screwed. 

Faulty drive unit? Too bad. China isn't going to provide the parts needed to assembly a new one.

And Tesla not making efforts to minimize the damage of the procurement is to be expected: 

[Myanmar's poisoned mountains provide rare earth metals to China, the dominant player in this field](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/natural-resource-governance/myanmars-poisoned-mountains/)

"Rant on Tesla service and build issuesI own a 2023 Model Y. I have created 4 service appoitnments so far to address cabin noise (rattling sound) over the course of an year.

During my recent appointment, service technician took a ride along with me for 5 mins and dismissed the issue as non-reproducible. I was disappointed, felt let down and started going home.

On the way back home, the cabin noise intensified. I turned back and asked technician to ride in the car again. Finally the technician was able to hear it and acknowledged the issue. Phew! Finally someone was able to diagnose the issue after 4 appointments!! or so I thought.

As fate would have it, I picked up my car from service and returned home. Instead of improving, the cabin noise became worse! Totally incompetent and unprofessional from Tesla that I have to go through this for an year now.

Deeply disappointed as I recommended Tesla to 4 of my friends and they all bought it. Now we are stuck with Tesla repair as they do not authorize local repair shops.

Icing on the cake: I waited 30 days for this freaking appointment and now I have to wait another month.

Bought the car for 55k with lot of hope and expectations which all came crashing. I liked it initially but the poor build quality, lack of timely repair and incompetency has made owning the car a nightmare.",11-25-2024

Over 40% Of Tesla's Profit Comes From Selling Regulatory Credits,11-23-2024
"Potential first-time Tesla and EV buyer, concerned about Tesla's non-Autopilot related crashesI've been driving ICE cars my whole life. I love the feel and features of Tesla Model 3, and thinking about getting one. Why it's appealing to me:

* Save time (more important, it's \~1hr per month of time saved) and money from gas stations
* FSD: I drive long commutes and it's tiring
* Modern

My main concerns are safety, and **would love inputs from anyone who's done their research**:

* There are many Autopilot/FSD related crashes and fatalities. I tell myself I can minimize this risk by (1) not getting FSD (2) always put hands on. (If I don't use FSD on highway commutes, appeal of the car does drop a bit.)
* More concerned about **fatal crashes like this where Autopilot was most likely not involved**: [https://web.archive.org/web/20230625201130/https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/mother-and-daughter-killed-in-santa-clara-tesla-crash/](https://web.archive.org/web/20230625201130/https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/mother-and-daughter-killed-in-santa-clara-tesla-crash/)
   * In this instance, an apparently mild driver was driving at \~50mph before the car mysteriously accelerated and crashed into a tree. 2 fatalities. 
   * Anyone has more info about this, or related, cases?

Clearly the concern is I don't want my Tesla to veer off and crash mysteriously even when autopilot/FSD isn't used.

Another question: Tesla has claimed their vehicles are safer on average than gas cars. **But I don't understand this claim unless it's talking about Autopilot/FSD.**  I've test driven Tesla without Autopilot/FSD and it...drives like a normal car. No extra safety features. So why are Teslas claimed to be safer?

Anyway TLDR is for people who've done their research, what's your concern / finding in terms of how frequent Teslas ran into mysterious crashes? Is [https://www.tesla-fire.com/](https://www.tesla-fire.com/) the best resources?",11-23-2024

"Before you buy a Tesla, look at the insurance costs.With a model y and a perfect driving history, you can expect to pay $2500 per year in insurance. 

I'm paying $1200 per year for my Honda Odyssey.  It used to be $1,000. My driving record isn't perfect. That's with a $500 deductible. 

What about the gas savings?  Well, use I $50-$65 a month in gas, but even if I used the epa estimated $2,000 in fuel annually, the ridiculous Tesla insurance cost means the annual cost for fuel + insurance is roughly the same.

Summary - the alleged Tesla fuel savings is offset by the increase in insurance cost.

"""Not driven by human"" markings?This is not strictly Tesla specific, but this community appears like the right place to bring it up. With Waymo and other sensor-based self driving systems, it's been quite obvious that the car is not driven by a human by just looking at it. But with Tesla insisting on going with cameras only, and sensors likely becoming smaller over time, should these cars not be marked with something to indicate the car may not be operated by a human driver? Similar to how some countries mandate special signs on vehicles driven by learners, as well as novice or very senior drivers?

Took delivery of my CT 6 days ago in Las Vegas. While inspecting the truck during my delivery appointment I noticed that the seals along both sides of the windshield were not uniform, and in fact appeared to have cracks in various places from the top to the bottom. Almost looks like cracked old tile grout.

The Tesla delivery center had no service techs at work at the time I took delivery, so I accepted delivery and immediately photographed this (along with a few other issues) and scheduled a service appointment.

The earliest SC appointment wasn't for several weeks.

Unfortunately, I don't have any other CT's to compare mine to, so I figured I would reach out here to see if anyone else's windshield seals look like this. I would assume that these seals should be nice and uniform, and look like a seal/gasket that is consistent from start to finish.

"CT creates its own Traffic JamWorst test drive organizers ever for a tech-dumpster! Just got back from the LA Auto Show and watched/experienced the horrendous organizing of CTs parked for test drives. There are two test drive locations. Tesla, Volvo, Polestar, Subaru and Stellantis share a drive-in location. Tesla makes its vehicles reverse ‚Äúin‚Äù to a spot instead of stacking them in 2 straight lanes, the way every other automaker at both test drive locations did. Even the Ram trucks at Stellantis were parked nicely and off to the side. As a result, Tesla managed to create their own traffic jam down a private road and at some points jamming the public street. None of the Tesla test drive participants were particularly paying attention to parking the cars at the end of their drive, ironically highlighting the impracticality of them. Product specialists from other brands were also very unimpressed by their handiwork at efficiency. Speaks volumes for the next guy running ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù.

Are we just waiting for people to die to take it off the roads?

According to this sub it seems like most of them are lemons that need ""specialists"" to fix within weeks or even days of claiming ownership. Is that really the most common case or do we just hate Tesla/Elon and are documenting this massive failure of theirs/his?

"ApologiesTo the people and communities my choices have affected,

I want to extend a sincere apology for my role in supporting a vehicle and a vision that, on reflection, endangers more than it benefits. As a Tesla Cybertruck owner, I recognize the inherent risks my vehicle poses to others‚Äîits oversized, steel-framed design isn‚Äôt just a personal choice or a statement, but a mobile hazard that instills fear among families, cyclists, and pedestrians who share the streets.

When I first made the decision to drive a Cybertruck, I was drawn to its technological promise, its power, and its defiance of convention. But I now understand that this choice contributes to a culture of excess and dominance that dismisses the safety of others and overlooks the responsibility we all share on the road. My vehicle, with its armored frame, presents real dangers‚Äîits weight, dimensions, and visibility challenges turn it into an unyielding force that doesn‚Äôt belong in public streets. I see now that its aesthetic of invincibility, once so appealing, translates directly into risks for anyone who happens to be in its path.

I apologize as well for supporting the egotism and misplaced priorities that brought this vehicle to life. By buying into this vision, I have, in part, endorsed a mindset that values spectacle over common sense and dismisses the impact on the very communities that are meant to benefit from innovation. My choice has, in effect, contributed to a brand that places personal ambition over public safety, technology over human-centered progress.

I know that no amount of regret can undo the dangers my Cybertruck may still pose, but I commit to seeking safer, more responsible transportation. I apologize for the harm and fear my vehicle represents to so many, and I will do my part to ensure the roads are safer for everyone.

Sincerely,
A non-tesla owner that made a template you actual owners should use.

>*We were driving on the freeway yesterday September 3rd at 9:30pm and my passenger side door swung open while on the entrance ramp to highway 24. My infant was sitting in that passenger side in her carseat and thankfully she wasnt injured. A car could have collided with that door or it could have hit anything outside resulting in extreme damage, injury, or death. Upon inspection of the door latch, the door latch is almost completely unhinged. The screw cam off, and the latch simply swivels and does not lock the door or hold it in place. We had to drive home with our hand physically holding the door closed. My driver side door also seems to not be fully latching - though it is not in as bad condition. But upon driving it, you can feel an airgap with the sound at higher speeds which suggests to me that this door latch is also at extreme risk of failure. These two doors are the only ones commonly used by us. But given they are both seemingly failing, my guess is that all four door latches are defective and at immediate risk of causing harm, injury, or death to those Cybertrucks on the road with the same latch.*

"Warning: a rising number of German Users report of corroding and failing brake lines in the Tesla Model 3Hello, 

I just want to inform you that in some Tesla Model 3 ( it seems especially from 2019, but there are first reports from 2020 models, too) the brake lines seem to start corroding away. It is hidden under the frunk, but after some brake failures, people started to check their Model 3s and now more and more Model 3 have been found that seem to have started corroding there. It maybe caused by a sticker that is attached to one of the brake lines and sometimes maybe speed up by a wrong placed 12v battery vent.

But it is still not fully known what the reason is...
There were some two old posts about this problem from US users here on Reddit, too. So maybe this is a way more widespread issue...

Here is the link to the thread, where you can find pictures of the problem, too:
https://tff-forum.de/t/warnung-zur-bremsleitung-model-3/342039/1

Here is a link to the post of the report the T√úV in Germany is sending out for checking, there you can see where you find the flaws: 
[https://tff-forum.de/t/warnung-zur-bremsleitung-model-3/342039/591](https://tff-forum.de/t/warnung-zur-bremsleitung-model-3/342039/591)
But keep in mind this is one of the worst cases, it starts below often at the sticker, where you often can't see it very well.


This might be a huge security risk and even the German T√ºv is now advised to check cars for this flaws...

Tesla even seems to know about the issue since it already has ""improved parts"" to replace them since more than 2 years.

The risk of brakes failing in a dangerous situation with drivers are unaware that their brake lines corrode,  seems to be very high and a lot of cars could be affected.

For me it is really baffling that Tesla seems to know about this problem but doesn't issue a recall. 

Edit: I posted this in the model 3 reddit, too. Because I think it is a safety issue that could cause people to lose their lives. But it seems they don't like Model 3 to get informed about this and they deleted it. Very sad that the Mods of the Tesla Model 3 doesn't care about the safety of its members.",12-28-2024

"Tesla vs other EVsHi, 

I have been considering getting the Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD and I am in Canada the price is 60k with a 5k rebate and it gives an estimate of 550 km. I have also been looking at the Hyundai ioniq 5 awd which is the same price and same rebate but less km about 490km. I care a lot about software and getting the most range, I am not a big fan of Elon musk and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other ceos who are not great. What would be your recommendation based on your experience with a Tesla. I also have a family of 3 and would use this for long drives with the family. ",12-24-2024

"Whether you like Elon or not his pivot to being a right wing underling to Trump is brilliant. Trump literally is about to cut the EV tax credit, cut subsidies for EV automakers and upstarts, and cut funding for charging networks. Oh and Elon likely escapes any DOJ investigations as well.This whole thing has played brilliantly for Elon. Competition for Tesla if these plans go into effect will be stifled and limited, he won't face legitimate criminal investigations for selling products that don't exist and pumping and dumping stock,  and now he has inside track on government contracts because he's in the Whitehouse.

"Time to say goodbye... Sold my Model Y....I like Tesla cars, really do, but I am relieved that I sold mine and bought an EQE. I took delivery of it today. I am not as giddy or excited by the EQE but I am relaxed about it.

Sooo  with the latest release of FSD we in Europe on the highways can actually use it. Up to now FSD was this half half thing that really did not work most of the time because it simply could not do the right thing.

As I was driving the car on the German autobahn I noticed how smooth everything was. I was thinking, ""ahhh really, I am about to trade my Tesla, that sucks they fixed things.""  Then as the FSD took me on the off ramp to the Mercedes dealership it decided that the off ramp road was much wider and FSD put me head first into an oncoming car taking the on ramp. I had to jerk the car hard and sevre to get out of the way.  My ""ahhh really"", turned into ""yeah I am good lets get rid of this car.""

That sums up my entire Tesla experience. It is not a bad car, but the fact that there is no front camera, no radar, no sonar, only vision makes it a REALLY bad car. Vision does not work. Tesla vision system is akin to working working working working, oops explosion not working oops sorry... There are many other little gotchas like difficulty parking tight spots, that need fixing. Yet Musk is more pre-occupied doing something else. I don't feel bad selling the car and am quite relieved. 

How is my EQE? Well it does not have FSD as worded, but has advanced driver assistance with augmented reality. Quite good actually and I am impressed. More impressed than what Tesla has brought to the table.

Thus good luck folks...

"Tesla Lease/Ownership QuestionI leased a model 3 in late 2022. Earlier in 2024, I decided to try to transfer the lease. I found a willing taker, and we went through Tesla's transfer process. After the taker was approved, it took us about 3 months to complete.

In the fall of 2024, Tesla emailed us both instructions on which documents to send in, what to sign, etc. Tesla then instructed us to transfer the car on a given day, and then Tesla would switch registration, app ownership, etc. Tesla sent us the signed agreement, signed by me, the assignee, and Tesla. They said the transfer was final. I thought everything was done.

Fast forward to about a week ago: Tesla sends me an overdue notice saying I haven't paid. I also receive a parking ticket in the mail for a city I haven't been to in years. Turns out, Tesla never switched the registration for the car.

I emailed Tesla to ask them to please switch the registration to the assignee's name retroactive to the transfer date. They replied saying they have no record of the transfer being approved and I should try to get the car back (!?). I sent them a copy of the signed agreement - signed by them - and forwarded a string of emails that spanned months showing that they've led me through this entire process, finalized the process, and that I followed their process every step of the way. Many of the emails on that thread were sent by the same rep that told me they have no record indicating the transfer was approved, lol. Since then, they've gone silent. (shocker).

My question is: what the heck? Has anyone else experienced this? Obviously this is there error, but should I be worried about what Tesla's incompetence can do to my credit? Can they garnish wages?

I've hired an attorney. But wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with Tesla botching something, refusing to admit to their mistake, and then just going silent. And, if so, what worked to unlock the stalemate and resolve the issue.",12-19-2024
"Tesla Orders - Buyer Beware**I was suggested to cross-post this here, that it would be appreciated.  Sorry if that breaks any rules.**

Just a public service announcement. I just had to put in a BBB complaint against Tesla over one of their custom car orders.

On 11/25 I put up $250 to custom order a Tesla because I didn't like anything on the lot, and because a sales rep AND the site claimed I could get it home delivered this year. They're running a reasonably good deal (3 months FSD+Supercharger) and I'd be eligible for it. Ever since, I've had nothing but problems with them.

First, they kept swapping VINs in and out of the account, not really explaining what they wanted but constantly requesting and unrequesting Insurance info. Not a big deal, but awkward. Each time, they tried to get me to swap to one of the models on the lot that I hadn't wanted in the first place.

Then, I was informed they don't do home deliveries in MA, so I'll have to drive 60 miles when it shows up. Annoying, but I found someone willing to give me a ride into Boston.

Then I was told my car was headed to a lot by last Friday. A couple days later, I was informed that was wrong and that car isn't built yet and my VIN changed again. Then I got a message that my car (new VIN) was ready and I could pick it up at any time. When I tried to contact them to set up an appointment, I was told that they had no idea why I was told that, and there were no matching cars in the New England area at this time.

Fast-forward to today. When things get really fun. Last night I sent an angry email that I wanted an update by Monday with real dates and an understanding about this FSD deal and whether I was going to lose that. Today, a Tesla rep called me to tell me there's no way a car will be in New England by the end of the year, and to try yet again to get me to pick a car on the lot. When I refused, he kept pushing and trying to convince me of different colors and how much money I'll save if he can get me into this or that base model.

When that call ended, it turned this way. He basically said ""ok, well I'll keep the reservation open just in case a car shows up, but it'll automatically expire at the end of the year""

My response was to question the deposit. And his... that if they can't find me the matching car by the end of the year, they're keeping the money. I'm no lawyer, but when somebody gives you money for something, and you don't give them that something back, you have no claim to that money. Thus begins a (hopefully short) battle to get my deposit refunded after all of Tesla's lies.

I can't speak to product question or after-purchase quality, but PLEASE for your own sakes, do not custom order a Tesla. I mean, it might go okay for you, but it could also go how it went for me.

UPDATE for those doubting BBB.  The local Tesla branch manager just called me to process a refund of the full balance.  She did not cite the consumer board complaint, but the BBB complaint.",12-19-2024

I already know I need an home backup solution because we have not infrequent power outages for a few hours to a few days. So, the question is more about whether Tesla or another solution is recommended or if anyone has experiences across the board. Generac, LG, Duracell, Fortress, and even Anker has come out with whole house battery backup solutions. Like others, I would prefer not to contribute to the Musk ecosystem, so does anyone here have any experience with any competitor products?

"Today is officially my DEMUSK day. I handed off my 4-year old model 3 for another car and it feels GOOD.If you own a Tesla and can afford it, I highly recommend having your own DEMUSK day (and share it here!).

My story:

1. Purchased a model 3 in September 2020. Musk at the time was annoying but bearable.
2. I just went back into my service history for the car. It's been back for repairs NINE times since I purchased it including things like:
   1. Severe cabin rattle (3 issues during the 4 years)
   2. Rear lights fogging up badly (twice)
   3. A car wash triggered a waterfall under the glovebox compartment. Passenger side was damaged. They blamed a dirt build up in the ventilator which was bullshit because it had just come back from servicing the A/C and I saw several cables sticking out under the glovebox (which I ignored at my peril).
3. The final straw was when the fake metal chrome laminate on the rear passenger door handle started to peel and come off. It felt awful when trying to open the door, nevermind how it looked. I logged a repair request under warranty but was denied as it was deemed to be ""normal wear and tear"". Ridiculous. So I just ended up cutting off the laminate with some scissors.

My car warranty expired in September so having to pay out of pocket for these things and make that cruel & lying billionaire earn more money was not going to happen.

"My Tesla M3LR Journey So Far üöóüí°This is my ongoing experience so far:

1.	\*\*Referral:\*\*¬†I placed an order for an M3LR on Monday the 25th using a referral code for $500. Less than 30 minutes later, they announced the referral discount would increase to $1,000. I asked if I could get the new discount, but the only option was to cancel and reorder, which means losing the $250 I already paid and starting the process all over again.  
  
2.	\*\*Finance:\*\*¬†Right after placing the order, I got an offer from JP Morgan Chase, but the interest rate was high. Without any notice, that offer disappeared, and my application stayed ‚Äúin process‚Äù for a few days. On Friday the 29th, I got a better offer from Santander Consumer USA, but the required down payment is outside my current budget. I‚Äôve reached out to them, but no response yet. Meanwhile, I‚Äôve checked a couple of credit unions and got a conditional approval from one, but they need a signed purchase agreement, which I obviously don‚Äôt have yet. I‚Äôm considering switching to the credit union and letting them and Tesla sort it out.  
  
3.	\*\*Trade-In:\*\*¬†I‚Äôm trading in my 2015 Toyota Prius, a car I‚Äôve had for over 7 years and will definitely miss. Tesla initially offered $6,300 based on the info I provided, but after sending photos, their final offer dropped to $5,000. While I know that‚Äôs low, I decided to go with them to avoid the hassle of fixing the car and selling it myself. I did check Carvana, CarMax, Driveway, and KBB, and their offers were similar, though those were based only on the initial info I provided, without photos.  
  
4.	\*\*Insurance:\*\*¬†I‚Äôm currently insured with Progressive and wanted to stay with them, but they‚Äôre asking for double my current premium if I switch to the new car. I shopped around and got a decent quote from GEICO, which is close to what I‚Äôm paying now.  
  
5.	\*\*Incentives:\*\*¬†I applied for the NJ EV income-based incentive of $2,000 (on top of the $2,000 automatic state incentive), totaling $4,000. My mistake was applying ‚Äútoo late‚Äù on the same day I placed the order during a holiday week. The approval hasn‚Äôt come through yet, so the delays in financing have actually been helpful. If everything settles in early December and the incentive still hasn‚Äôt come through, I‚Äôll move forward without it.  
  
6.	\*\*Delivery Date:\*\*¬†Since I haven‚Äôt accepted any of the offers yet, Tesla has moved my delivery date three times so far, and it may get pushed again. Does this look bad on my end, or is it normal?

Extra:¬†I saw a post saying Black Friday is the best time to get accessories for a new car, so I went ahead and ordered a bunch to be ready from Day 1.

Thanks for sticking with my (probably boring) story! Feel free to ask questions or share any recommendations if I‚Äôm missing something or doing anything wrong. Thanks, everyone!

TL;DR:

‚Ä¢	Ordered M3LR with a $500 referral; missed out on $1,000 due to timing.  
  
‚Ä¢	Financing issues: high rates, missing offers, and delays with credit unions.  
  
‚Ä¢	Tesla trade-in dropped my Prius offer from $6,300 to $5,000, but I accepted for convenience.  
  
‚Ä¢	Switched from Progressive to GEICO after a big rate hike.  
  
‚Ä¢	NJ EV incentives ($4K) delayed; may not get them before delivery.  
  
‚Ä¢	Delivery date shifted 3 times so far.",12-01-2024

"By accident, Tesla finally does something right. I lost both key fobs a while ago and I‚Äôve been using my phone to start my car. 

Whoever had the idea to let a customer buy a fob off EBay for 50 bucks and let customers finally program their own fobs is a hero. 

Tesla service used to charge over 200 bucks. Replacing fobs on a regular car is stupidly expensive. 

I hate this company. I hate the CEO. I can‚Äôt blame the employees, they just want a job.

"Rant on Tesla service and build issuesI own a 2023 Model Y. I have created 4 service appoitnments so far to address cabin noise (rattling sound) over the course of an year.

During my recent appointment, service technician took a ride along with me for 5 mins and dismissed the issue as non-reproducible. I was disappointed, felt let down and started going home.

On the way back home, the cabin noise intensified. I turned back and asked technician to ride in the car again. Finally the technician was able to hear it and acknowledged the issue. Phew! Finally someone was able to diagnose the issue after 4 appointments!! or so I thought.

As fate would have it, I picked up my car from service and returned home. Instead of improving, the cabin noise became worse! Totally incompetent and unprofessional from Tesla that I have to go through this for an year now.

Deeply disappointed as I recommended Tesla to 4 of my friends and they all bought it. Now we are stuck with Tesla repair as they do not authorize local repair shops.

Icing on the cake: I waited 30 days for this freaking appointment and now I have to wait another month.

Bought the car for 55k with lot of hope and expectations which all came crashing. I liked it initially but the poor build quality, lack of timely repair and incompetency has made owning the car a nightmare.",11-25-2024

Over 40% Of Tesla's Profit Comes From Selling Regulatory Credits,11-23-2024
"Potential first-time Tesla and EV buyer, concerned about Tesla's non-Autopilot related crashesI've been driving ICE cars my whole life. I love the feel and features of Tesla Model 3, and thinking about getting one. Why it's appealing to me:

* Save time (more important, it's \~1hr per month of time saved) and money from gas stations
* FSD: I drive long commutes and it's tiring
* Modern

My main concerns are safety, and **would love inputs from anyone who's done their research**:

* There are many Autopilot/FSD related crashes and fatalities. I tell myself I can minimize this risk by (1) not getting FSD (2) always put hands on. (If I don't use FSD on highway commutes, appeal of the car does drop a bit.)
* More concerned about **fatal crashes like this where Autopilot was most likely not involved**: [https://web.archive.org/web/20230625201130/https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/mother-and-daughter-killed-in-santa-clara-tesla-crash/](https://web.archive.org/web/20230625201130/https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/mother-and-daughter-killed-in-santa-clara-tesla-crash/)
   * In this instance, an apparently mild driver was driving at \~50mph before the car mysteriously accelerated and crashed into a tree. 2 fatalities. 
   * Anyone has more info about this, or related, cases?

Clearly the concern is I don't want my Tesla to veer off and crash mysteriously even when autopilot/FSD isn't used.

Another question: Tesla has claimed their vehicles are safer on average than gas cars. **But I don't understand this claim unless it's talking about Autopilot/FSD.**  I've test driven Tesla without Autopilot/FSD and it...drives like a normal car. No extra safety features. So why are Teslas claimed to be safer?

Anyway TLDR is for people who've done their research, what's your concern / finding in terms of how frequent Teslas ran into mysterious crashes? Is [https://www.tesla-fire.com/](https://www.tesla-fire.com/) the best resources?",11-23-2024

"Before you buy a Tesla, look at the insurance costs.With a model y and a perfect driving history, you can expect to pay $2500 per year in insurance. 

I'm paying $1200 per year for my Honda Odyssey.  It used to be $1,000. My driving record isn't perfect. That's with a $500 deductible. 

What about the gas savings?  Well, use I $50-$65 a month in gas, but even if I used the epa estimated $2,000 in fuel annually, the ridiculous Tesla insurance cost means the annual cost for fuel + insurance is roughly the same.

Summary - the alleged Tesla fuel savings is offset by the increase in insurance cost. 

What do you pay annually for insurance on your Tesla?",11-22-2024

I know the obvious answer is MAGA, however pretty sure those people don‚Äôt believe in electric vehicle, Trump hates electric cars. Im not understanding the long term play here. 

Either Elon gets Trump to agree to major fleet changes in the USGOV from Ford and Chevy, to Tesla, but then that means infrastructure.

"Working at Tesla Energy vs. Automotive?Hello Tesla skeptic hive mind; I am considering an offer for the Tesla Energy team in Palo Alto.

All I have heard is nightmare stories about working for Tesla and a somewhat ridiculous culture - rude colleagues, insane work hours for relatively little pay, etc.

The offer I have been given is a significant step up for me, but I am dreading potentially walking into an emotionally/professionally abusive minefield.

When I met with the team in person, all but one of them were extremely professional and competent. One came across like a pretty big a-hole.

"""Not driven by human"" markings?This is not strictly Tesla specific, but this community appears like the right place to bring it up. With Waymo and other sensor-based self driving systems, it's been quite obvious that the car is not driven by a human by just looking at it. But with Tesla insisting on going with cameras only, and sensors likely becoming smaller over time, should these cars not be marked with something to indicate the car may not be operated by a human driver? Similar to how some countries mandate special signs on vehicles driven by learners, as well as novice or very senior drivers?

"Need real feedback on X
As a potential buyer of a used 2022+ Tesla Model X, I'd appreciate honest feedback from current owners. Due to depreciation concerns, purchasing a new EV isn't feasible for me. With two small children, I require a vehicle with a third row, and the Model X's captain chairs are a significant advantage.

Setting aside brand preferences and politics, I'd love to know:

1. What motivated you to sell or consider replacing your Model X?
2. If you were to choose another EV with comparable software capabilities to Tesla, which model would you opt for?

Your insights will greatly help me make an informed decision.

For reference, I am also considering Taycan and Escalade. ",11-19-2024
"Ashamed to own a Tesla; good alternatives?Anyone else feeling ashamed of owning a Tesla after all the bullshit Elon has done? Especially with his stance and him supporting trump and his rhetoric. I am, and I wish I hadn‚Äôt bought this car.

I have a few dumb questions as this was the first car I ever bought new.

I am hoping to sell but I know it will be tricky since I still owe money on it and last I heard they don‚Äôt retain value as well as they used to. Is this still true?

If I were to attempt to get another car would I need to get a loan that covers what I still owe plus the value of whatever car I end up choosing?

For those of you that have already jumped ship, what did you land on? If I‚Äôm being honest I‚Äôm leaning away from electric and potential choosing a Prius. I want to say I‚Äôd go electric but the only reason I went Tesla was for the supercharger network? How are the charging networks for non teslas?
